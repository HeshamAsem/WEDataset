91,we had a one year contract with home telecom between sep and connection date was arranged a month in advance but it took a further two weeks past the connection date for them to actually get it working this caused us a whole world of problems as we were working from home during the pandemic as compensation they said we wouldnt be charged for these two weeks but that later turned out not to be the eventually getting it working we then spent the year trying to resolve connection speed issues our typical download speed was mbps which is inadequate and far below their guarantee of at least mbps they never resolved this and never compensated us for the impact this had on our year at the gave them ample notice that we were leaving at the end of august yet after paying this final month they let us know that they would be charging us an early termination fee and disconnection fee it turns out what theyd actually done at the start was extend our contract by two weeks without our consent despite knowing we would no longer be at the property during this contacted them by phone after minutes on hold and were led to believe that this was their mistake and there would be nothing to pay they said they would call us back if there were any further few weeks later having not heard anything further and assuming everything was fine we received a bill for contrary to what we had discussed with them previously they are now insisting we would not recommend home telecom for your home broadband provider,Bad

168,i will never advise anyone to use vodafone network it happened that a month before my contract with them finished i called them to cancel my contract because i wont be renewing after the end of the contract to my surprise when i thought the contract had been cancelled so i could move to another network they brought a bill that im owing outstanding debt due to the fact that i didnt inform them in advance i argued it with them that id called to cancel my contract and that all payment have been made we dragged it and i had no choice than to pay before i made the payment i requested for my pac no so i could move but they said i have to wait for a month before i could get it since i want to move to a pay as you go package on another network two weeks later without using the phone i called back and the guy who attended to me said they gave me false information that i could get my pac anytime i want i got my pac that same day to my surprise weeks later they brought another bill to say i am still owing due to the time i made the first payment and date i collected my pac i argued it that they gave me false information and that was why i waited for two weeks again to request for my pac but they insisted i have to pay that the only help they could do is they will cancel pounds out of the debt and i will have to pay the rest please i implore anyone not to have anything to do with vodafone they are scammers thieves and unreliable people running the company,Bad
169,i would not recommend vodafone come rain or shine continuous mistakes and incompetency my mobile data had run out and i called to add an additional bundle at a set cost however i was offered a new monthly allowance of data for a good cost which i was told would be immediately activated this was never added and my data had stopped working only able to use internet through wifi this was two weeks of on going uselessness from vodafone i had to take several days off work and had to spend many hours on the phone all of which proved to be useless the instore team were informed by i believe the sorry if because my contract was stuck between two that i would terminate one at no cost and open another to ensure that my data was working ofcourse i still did not have a working phone and vodafone tried to trap me into two contracts resulting in me travelling to the head office to get resolved and therefore a large credit to my account and a discount throughout the remainder of my contract as a then had a phone of mine stolen and i de activated the sim a new one was sent which at the time due to not having a device as it was stolen could not activate instead of activating the new sim when requested vodafone activated the old sim resulting in a person whom i hold a restraining order who stole the phone in the first place being able to contact me and use a service i pay for when raising the complaint i was advised by a member of staff over the phone that i did not understand the procedure and no one would listen to my complaint eventually i managed to speak to someone and a credit applied to my taking out one of my contracts months ago i added a payment which would cap my data every month this was never set up correctly and i have paid in total for gb dongle to be added to my account which was clear mis selling through my experiences with vodafone and their lack of capability to get simple things right i paid for this throughout the months when ringing to ensure the agreement doesnt continue i was advised it is day written notice and i would be charged another for a months service which didnt give me anything simply gained profit for vodafone despite the fact this means will be paid for nothing i have been told a credit as a gesture of good will is satisfactory but not least i had gone over my data quite frankly i am never sure how this happens and am certain vodafone adjust elements to ensure you go over but as i said i went over my data and i can understand if when my bill was due my bank had insufficient funds yes do feel free to cut off my phone with still days until my bill is due vodafone cut my phone due to high usage i am sorry but that is have been many other poor experiences but those listed above are just a few to read and hopefully enough yo give you a sour thought about joining vodafone unfortunately at the minute i am not on any legal ground to cancel my contracts and will have to wait until termination of the months but best believe once this is up i will be long gone,Bad
170,havent dealt with the company after the sham they were before and closed all my accounts have nothing to do with company and today have received a letter through for a bill when called woman wasnt even sure what it was for now ive been on hold for minutes trying to get through for the phone to be cut off,Bad

174,dont chose virgin media endless lies tricks to fool and cheat you lies about your contract and made up terms and conditions the customer service is a disgrace and the pinnacle of incompetence and part of the business model it might be a short term gain but i dont think that anyone thought beyond that you cant get through to cancel the contract if you ever get through you are being passed from department to department or agent to agent and nobody can help you and is they tell you that you can in the notice only days in advance dont believe that you can hand in the notice to discontinue your contract after youre minimum contract term ends at any time during the contract its just important that you do it through the proper channels and have proof of it i recommend calling them and record those phone calls make it clear that you want to cancel the contract after the minimum term ends next chapter complaints are not handled and the practice is to close a complaint with made up nonsense and email you that its solved or just transfer it to a new complaint i have a complaint which was resolved times and transferred and is still ongoing and not whatsapp customer service is a joke they tell you that you can text the number to cancel the contract you will receive a message that says somebody will contact you dont worry they can call the hotline to cancel the contract if you ever get through they will tell you they cant do it and that they have to transfer you to the cancellation team which doesnt exist and is just a trick to get rid of you if you made it this far you either had the same experience or want to do a proper research about virgin media broadband dont do it its not worth your time and energy it cant be that cheap if you ever get promised a amazon voucher yes its true you have to chase them for ages and if youre lucky they tell you a story about a issue but they will give you a discount on the next bill thats after months chasing them i can go on and on with my bad experience,Bad

179,i was no longer under contract to anyone so decided to change over to bt was assured online by a bt operative they would handle the changeover from virgin to bt and i would have to do nothing after sign up they said they do not change over from virgin that was my responsibility consequently virgin continued billing me because they had not been notified i would have notified virgin if i had been told by bt they would not do this but on two separate occasions i was assured by two different bt online operatives they would do the change over i have complained and complained which they send me in circles via email addresses for bt switchover who just send out a generic letter saying they do not refund bills or indian call centres or ignore i have part transcript showing a bt online operative actually saying change over would be automatic i ended up with a bill from virgin because of bts neglect to state clearly they do not switch over for you i was told they do bt refuses to acknowledge anything they said they refuse to acknowledge my complaints they refuse to acknowledge the reference numbers of the complaints they lied to get me to sign up then reneged on what they told me they have denied the transcript i kept of their operative clearly stating lets get you up and running then switch over will be automatic they have ignored their own reference numbers given by operatives if you have a choice dont touch bt with a foot they want the signature and once you are under contract ignore you liars and thieves,Bad
180,we switched a corporate contract phones from ee a few months ago and we are really regretting it the service is really poor frequent dropped call text messages and voicemails delayed by hours voice calls which suddenly warp into almost comical deep slow tones and an inability to send text messages using wifi calling i have just tried to express my frustration to their customer services and got nowhere,Bad
181,it is impossible to express the total inept service provided by bt from the th august to present date i could write a book each time i speak to an agent on the phone and they read the account motes they cannot believe the way we have been treated i will try to keep a short story rather than a aug cut off our land line no reason no explanation th august pm cut off our broadband no reason no explanation sent me an ee hub absolutely useless not worth the get a reconnection several days later but lost my number which we had had for years we set up a house move with all parties in the loop you guessed it on the day of the move no bt to discuss no explanation we had the issue elevated to a welfare as i have terminal cancer and need constant communication in place following which bt sent an engineer out to our old address days in a row the engineers were unable to do anything as they did not have the correct info on each then had several occasions whereby the case got raised to a welfare case but it had no effect i must have spent hours on the phone to bt from my mobile which has cost me a finally got a phone line days after the move date i will spare you all the telephone calls upto that date and the total lack of assistance by the many customer service operatives to be fair there were also some great operatives but in the end they were just confounded by the system they were working within almost all of them when having reviewed the account notes were amazed that anyone could be treated in such a wayi believe the way bt treat their customers but it would appear that they really do not care and have a monopoly to one extent or another leaving us all with no real now have a number of complaints lodged with bt which they seem to be closing as they like without any consultation with me there operational practice is shocking beyond belief and their approach to customer service beggars could go on and on i have names dates of all contacts with the various bt operative and would love to have a conversation with a bt manager but unfortunately i do not think they exist,Bad
182,vodafone just pathetic service a while ago i wrote a review for vodafone hoping it would maybe register to someone just how poor their service is so what has happened i get a reply saying i can chat with them through twitter or facebook yeah great but i do not use either that was the extent of their reply so this is a further update of how a poor service has actually got worse vodafone mobile app is so often down for maintenance that its almost useless security verification codes generated from the vodafone login web page have been going to someone else number eventually sorted by support staff they admitted they had been having issues with this problem on the my vodafone menu half of the control functions are greyed out which requires calling a support operative to amend even this doesnt always work mobile coverage is diabolical probably great if you live on one of the major cities but the general cover for east anglia is poor luckily my contract expires in october i really think a star rating would be appropriate,Bad
183,my husband and i are moving home on june we emailed talktalk to cancel from that date we then got a letter ut if the blue on may saying our service would end on may we tried to contact them by livechat and phone to tell them this was wrong no one we talk to can help another team need to call us back but never do when we asked for a number we were given one that doesnt work my husband is a key worker and needs the internet to do his job we are at our wits end,Bad

186,i only leave one star as its not possible to leave zero my experience with virgin has without a doubt been the worst customer service ive ever wifi since it was installed with no solution offered and no communication unless i incoming phone and the promise to have a technician out within hours expired days great people when i call in but no help whatsoever disgusting the reply below arrived days after i posted this review i still have poor range in my average bed house and no phone i have terminated my contract with them,Bad

188,we are in the middle of a line move since weeks the dates of the solution and fixing is keep postponed i just got empty words over the phone from the technical support and from the customer service too i am fed up i wouldnt choose them again never the best part the engineer ruined our old broadband from a supplier and they just dont care about it noone takes any responsibility so now i need to pay broadband and got nothing thanks for being incompetent and miserable dear talktalk nothing happened again just another appointment has been postponed this is not service it is the th of nov no broadband for almost months bit they still want me to pay for nothing such a dilettante company,Bad
189,i have been planning to leave for a while with the installation of in my area i have had no problems with vms product it simply isnt right for me at this time in my life so i was expecting to leave as a broadly satisfied customer with a positive view of vm and willing to return to them in the future potentially when i move house in all of this in mind i tried to cancel i went to my account online it was originally setup and always managed fully online so this would be the most reasonable way to expect to cancel not possible i searched around to work out how to cancel and established that they force you to speak to a person to cancel which enables them to add hurdles and apply pressure to dissuade you which seems very immoral and i am unpleasantly surprised if such behaviour is still i went back to a letter informing me of a price rise and how to cancel if i was unhappy the if in their statement appears misjudged this led me to online chat twice attempted and twice thwarted with errors then phone which directed me text message which directed me to whatsapp but still demanding information input each time finally on whatsapp it tells me they are very busy but dont worry they wont respond straight away and i can get on with my day so i do it takes them an hour to respond and when i get back to my phone an hour after that it has reset my chat and puts me right back to the start of entering all my details again i am still waiting as i write this but here are the key numbers attempts to cancel so far times having to input all my account details star which is too generous chances left for vm to ever get their grubby on my hard earned money they have wasted far too much of my valuable time,Bad
190,unacceptable service arranged for a engineer to fix broadband dropping in and out didnt turn up no call to say they werent able to i had to call to find out what happened apparently they needed to do some ground works and rearrange engineer to visit a week later today there was supposed to be a engineer out to sort this out still no one has bothered to turn up after a long phone call and passed about by many people they wanted me to rearrange for two weeks in the future i have now cancelled my service with virgin,Bad
191,i have been a talk talk customer for many years and believe they used to offer real value for money in the past months i have had internet issues repeatedly on separate occasions being left with no internet for a week at a time i am currently waiting for an engineer to attend the house as talk talk customer team could not diagnose the current issue i was told the wait for an engineer was a week because many people were having problems with their broadband this doesnt exactly sound good for the company they have reversed the no price rise mid contract policy thar they used to have so not only is the service getting worse customers are paying more for it im sorry to say i would steer clear of talk talk and go somewhere else you may pay a little more but youll get a service that you can actually use i will be moving to another provider as early as i can,Bad
192,was with ee for mobile now have free wifi so as my contract was nearly up i phoned them up to get a lower deal for net as i had gb need it deal around gb they offered was per as high as all bye you for the reply to my review stating you would like to keep me why would i pay twice as much as all other didnt mention that did too end,Bad

237,started a phone contract with vodafone years ago as i needed a new phone and it was the best option at the time after half a year they increased my monthly payments from from which was fine not too much of a difference still annoying that they changed my contract once my two years were up i didnt want to start a new contract but managed to bag a great deal for with carphone after half a year once again they increased my contract by over absolutely ridiculous its already quite expensive and on top of that i have to pay a day if i am abroad and use mobile net or if i call fair to say this is the last phone contract i will have with this company tired of these unexpected price increases,Bad

250,never get an account with vodafone they dont take any responsibility their end when it comes to problems they blame it all on you so they dont have to deal with it you get promised call backs which you never receive and when you try and speak to a higher up manager you get told this is not a game where you get to demand who you speak to if they dont do their job properly and dont take the direct debit from your account they dont bother ringing you or sending you letters they send it straight to a debt collector then tell you they tried getting in touch this is all lies you dont get taken seriously they ask you what they can do for you but they cant actually do anything you wish been trying weeks to speak to a manager and this is what iv been left with being told i need to take responsibility and they aint doing nothing about it when they read back over the notes it states clearly about a phone back which they tried once and left no voicemail and didnt bother trying again this shows clearly they dont care and you dont get taken seriously wouldnt recommend to anybody stay well clear you can see why they have lots of complaints my account ended in october and now iv got to deal with their mess up this is unacceptable and ridiculous stay clear their are much better providers out there,Bad
251,i dont recomend this at all if you are thinking about calling them just change your mind because they will tell you to talk to someone in person and if you do that they will tell you to talk to someone on the phone so basically they are wasting your time and your money and they dont care about you the customer at day i went to a virgin media worker and i tried to explain him how bad is their internet he didnt even waited for me to say what i had to say and he told me to call someone from virgin media i also said that virgin media has a lot of bad reviews and he said that its not pay actually because they charge people more than they should and i pay for mbs but i only get or maximum and i also have bad think we should take them down for what are they doing for taking money from people without giving what they should do something about them because people get and that is not good,Bad
252,i moved my account to my new address but they forgot to book an open reach engineer visit because there is no access point in this house i am now going to be without broad band for days being the next available engineer appointment and i have an online business to run the reason is if course which many companies are now using to cover up shoddy service shame on you vodafone,Bad

255,your service keeps cutting off several times a week for last months sometimes few times a day bristol every time i try call waiting list is longer than i can justify time to go to more virgin media,Bad
256,the only way i can describe being with vodafone is being in a toxic manipulative gas lighting and abusive relationship i was with three for over years then decided to explore somewhere else i am going back to three and never looking back the network coverage is awful i couldnt get a proper mifi signal in my own home and it was insisted by the customer service they in fact assured me multiple times that it was fine they wasted so much of my time on the customer chat they wait for you to give up this is clearly their tactic they charged me for a giga cube i was having problems with it months in but managed to keep me a further months pledging that there were works in my area and its all done i eventually went to a store locally and they said its probably the device can we have another please to which you can image what i said then they wouldnt let me leave it took me weeks and then finally a hour conversation on chat on my day off where they bartered tried to give me at this point i just said you have made my working from home life so unprofessional and so unbearable that is a complete insult then tried to pass me onto customer retention to which i replied i do not want to be retained i have the screen shots of this if anyone wants to see i asked for my puk number so i could test to see if it was the device or in fact if i could use my device with another carrier and they sent me an email saying as they do not provide service for me anymore this is not possible scam artists i have had the device for over a months and now i cant use it with anyone else they tired everything to make me give up honestly do not become a customer it will ruin your life back to three for me like a bad date abusive narcissistic partner who will not change will not accommodate and then blames you for someone who really values their freedom of choice this was an absolute nightmare,Bad
257,almost years with virgin consisting of multiple router changes and poor communication throughout currently days of no wifi no explanation no resolve after chasing again today told area outage resolving on th september notified compensation only given on days of no service almost an hour on call with sales retention team who couldnt resolve the problem but thought id like to renew my contract at the inflated price im paying out of contract for a faster ineffective service on declining their kind offer the call deteriorated resulting in my raising a complaint which she then wanted to although apparently complaints no longer entail listening to the call now waiting days despite no contract to receive a cancellation worst company ive ever had dealings with,Bad

262,had an adsl connection for a few months that worked without issue when moving to a new apartment i had the option of having infinity installed which i had done nothing but problems since with promises of engineer visits which never went through getting half their advertised speed meaning its not really worth paying the infinity premium on it anytime i speak to someone through their helpline im left with nothing but frustration have tried multiple routers phone calls and still left with an unstable connection to which theyre unwilling to you can avoid going with them do so,Bad
263,if there was a minus rating virgin broadband customer services would get it i have called over times been on hold for periods promised my issues would be resolved and they werent bathe quality of the broadband is reasonable the customer service is the worst ive ever experienced i wouldnt recommend the service do not do it to yourself,Bad
264,the experience i have received since moving to using virgin is terrible i work from home and my pc keeps being cut off im losing connection constantly even if i open doors in the house wifi fails my tv also has interference across the screen so unable when i call and speak to customer service they say theres nothing wrong so cant send an servicei called their customer service who told me that they would resolve the problem remotely nothing evening i called their customer service for over two hours and still no answer how can they constantly take monthly subscription and yet i receive a substandard service from virgin media,Bad
265,is it even legal to sell wifi this bad,Bad
266,i changed broadband to vodafone a few months ago the fibre connection kept dropping every few minutes and the broadband speed was really slow which they admitted after a few hours of phone calls engineer visits and a new router over the last the last months the problems have not been vodafone will not let me out of my contract until they get a rd engineer out to resolve the problems that the first engineers could not stay away from vodafone,Bad

268,been with bt for years and had no problems until now i have recently moved home and also run an online business from home so having an internet connection is of paramount importance unfortunately bt mislead me into believing that the connection would be up and running by monday th and this still isnt the case if i knew that it wouldnt be up and running by then i would have made alternative arrangements but now unfortunately i need to stay in the property to accommodate for works to be done and furniture to be dropped off after numerous phone calls to and from and claims that they can not get an engineer out until they see fit as it doesnt fit nicely with their sla even though they promised a one today tuesday th they keep telling you what you want to hear and keep delaying the process now i have logged a complaint and asked to speak with a manager and they havent responded i have no idea whats going on and currently cant work on my business which is impacting my livelihood the best way to describe bt is as a bunch of unorganised mis leading cow boys these guys have cost me already because of their inactions if i had a choice i wouldnt touch these guys again with a barge pole but unfortunately they run the monopoly when it comes to broadband in the area so i am left with no alternative but to use this damn right awful company,Bad
269,avoid recommend paying extra for a different provider its not worth the hassle continuous outages throughout the day or days long coverage throughout the house is terrible so will also need to pay for extenders want to get ahold of someone to raise a fault query next to impossible with their customer service or pay an extra for a call out,Bad
270,the phone staff have no accountability so they can talk to you how they feel fit talking over you saying for you to shut up and listen to them and stop talking over them also refusing to answer questions until you listen to what they read off the screen as they have poor knowledge of the service and giving technical information that is completely false but when you try to explain they are wrong they will talk over you and not listen i am done with them after my last call i get fitted by in a couple of days then im leaving i have made a complaint about the phone agents attitude but i feel it will not be taken seriously and it should i have never been spoken to in the way i was by anybody in my life i was once in management myself if i had heard someone speak to a client like i was spoken to i would have fired them on the spot as i say i do not think these talktalk phone agents have any asked to talk to a supervisor and was told we dont do that here so no you asked for her name and was told i told you my name at the beginning of the call im not repeating myself i said i was going to make a complaint and she played the victim and said oh you going to threaten me now where is the training this is no way to talk to have been with talktalk for over yrs i have never had such a bad experience that has made me feel this bad towards am leaving that i know for i received this message twice on my will contact you about your complaint on between if you wish to change or cancel this please call i waited for the call it never guys are a i then get this were sorry youve had a problem with our tried to contact you about your complaint as we want to put things right as soon as our investigation we want to let you know that we are unable to fix the issue without speaking to call us on within days or well begin the process to close your are now liars too you have not tried to contact me at automated messages saying you emails no calls on my house phone no calls on my mobile your actions i can see you deserve your bad reputation,Bad

278,the worst company to try get in touch with nearly an hour just to speak to someone customer service isnt all bad if you are lucky enough to get through to a human the last time i spoke to someone they were based in england bonus and actually spoke english double bonus probably due to and that the majority of contact centres closed and asked their staff to work from home prior to ive only ever managed to get through to someone who sounds like theyre on the other side of the world and spoke broken english the actual wifi isnt much better always cutting out or having poor signal even with one of the top bundles and even worse pricing absolutely no regard for loyal customers hiking prices year after year until i was paying more than double what i first signed up to cheers virgin its been a pleasure,Bad

301,honestly i am quite appalled by the service that has been provided to myself and my family especially during these difficult times people are asked to work from home as we are in the middle of the pandemic and when our router decided to go down due to technical faults on virgin medias behalf we took it upon ourselves to contact virgin media for assistance we kindly asked for as much help as possible as four people in my family are all working from home online and so this is essential that we have connection we were then told we would have to wait a week before we could get anyone sent out to us to even look at the issue we are now left with no internet access leaving us unable to work for seven days quite shocking altogether,Bad

308,i cant find the words maybe a company that cant communicate but will take you into labyrinths of madness ok i got the replacement sim i ordered but it doesnt connect the cheery folder it came in had a web address for help in activating a sim but it took me to a and crikey we cant find that page maybe you typed the wrong address tried again a different saying theyd looked everywhere for such a page even down richards sofa how terribly jolly they cant even run their own website as you may know if you have ever tried to find your way around it after an interesting text discussion with a customer services bot i was told i would be transferred to a human being and i was in a queue estimated wait in queue given as four hours they say they are only taking phone calls from vulnerable customers which i am on the basis of age and serious illness but absolutely no way i could find to register as a vulnerable person i will say this for them they are very good at selling stuff when my contract ended and they were trying to persuade me to buy a new phone that dream machine they purred about two years ago now being apparently a useless antiquity up to five phone calls a day maybe they have a lot more sales people than people to help you when you urgently need it,Bad
309,do not use talk talk we decided to use talk talk as the price seemed decent and the service seemed to be excellent for the price we were quoted for fibre optic broadband first big error this is not fibre optic broadband as it comes down the phone line there might be fibre optics use somewhere between the far east where the call centre is and our house but it certainly doesnt come into our property the engineer was dismissive about any questions we asked and has damaged our new exterior coating that was completed days earlier at a cost of and has cut the bt phone line when we asked him about the tv as he would not put the router through to our rear room where we live he said it needed to be next to the router we were not asked this when we signed up when we rang to complain we went through to the usual far eastern call centre and were passed from pillar to post between several people who we had great difficulty understanding i hate to think how difficult this would be for an older person after a couple of hours yes really over two days we told them to cancel the contract only to be told we would have to pay over to cancel a service which we never received i then told the chap on the phone that we were giving due notice of cancelation and that if they wished to charge us then we would pursue a claim for the damage to our property on the third day we then got another call saying the cancellation had gone ahead as well as our complaint being escalated this week a week later my wife got another call with the asian chap wanting to discuss how they could solve the set up problems what he then said they had no record of our cancelation but when pushed he miraculously found it at each stage the person on the phone mentioned complaints departments but would not put us through and only put us on hold coming back five minutes later with no answer clearly they just went for a coffee break and came back we are now waiting to speak with ofcom you have to wait weeks and for a quote from our painter for the repairs this company is an utter disgrace to the industry and the only reason they got one star is because that is the minimum this site will allow steer well clear,Bad
310,im not sure of his position but the manager at the front of the store dan according to his badge was very unhelpful and kept telling me to call up customer services on the phone even though i had told him several times that i had tried this and had no success cant wait to leave vodafone,Bad
311,i decided to change to talk talk as out of contract from my provider however it has turned out to be a nightmare from the moment i placed my order i was inundated with emails with contradicting each other some asking me to phone which i did but found it not necessary then i received an email to say my new router had been delivered but it had not so i rang them again they said ring back next week i rang back next week and they said they could not order a new one yet on the day my old provider should have cut off my service nothing happened on phoning them i found out that talk talk had not notified them of my leaving them now the worse bit i phoned talk talk again to cancel my order as could not put up with anymore hassle and they said i could only cancel my order if i agreed to terms and conditions which included me agreeing to charges for a service not yet set up when i said no they said i could not cancel,Bad

315,i called vodafone customer service to ask them to move my broadband as im moving house they disconnected my current broadband two weeks early leaving me with no wifi while im supposed to be working from home due to the pandemic despite the fact that they disconnected my wifi within two days of my original call they have maintained that it will take two full weeks to reactivate my wifi at my current address and that i might as well just wait the two weeks until i move to my new address ive been on the phone and on chats with customer advisors times today and every time i got the same that i have already paid for this month and they are just not providing the servicei will never be a vodafone customer again i will move to a different provider as soon as my contract is over and i will be encouraging everyone i know to do the same shocking customer service,Bad

353,been with bt for weeks all working fine until yesterday afternoon took hours yes hours of calls and chats to speak to someone in the uk and only then because i threatened to leave of my communications were through bangalore or hyderabad who were just reading through scripts asking you the same thing time and time again complete waste of time finally managed to speak to someone over here and within minutes explained it all still doesnt explain why i have to wait days for a call and possibly a full week before my service is restored maddening we only came back to bt because we wanted to get away from talktalk what a mistake,Bad
354,been on the internet over two hours telling talk talk my digit account number they kept repeating account number should be digits i can only tell them whats on the bills i receive every month they have no problem taking the money but cannot help with the problem with my landline,Bad
355,following on from my last review of bt after which i received a very welcome refund i looked at my account today only to find id been overcharged by some on my june bill after minutes on hold and i was told that i would receive a refund for this i asked what proof i could have of this conversation as the chances were high that id have to chase this up again in the future and eventually a complaint was raised on my behalf but i swear this would not have if i hadnt pressed my point come on bt give us some respect you treat us as customers extremely poorly and your only saving grace are the decent people working for you on the phones who have to cover for your corporate ineptitude a shocking state of affairs as usual,Bad
356,im on the best wifi service they provide and their connection times out at least once a day they lick the fattest gonads ever dont be with them im also normally in games while this happens and it is extremly stressful but this also happens while not being in game we called them up to fix this too and they said it was fine its not,Bad
357,i can honestly say this is the worst company for broadband and customer service i have been with this company for years and in march when i tried to pay my bill because i was late they had changed all my personal details so the next time i rang up they told me my phone number email and password did not match this is not the case i requested a bill to be sent to my address so i can pay it but they refused as my bill was set up to a non existent email that i have never given to them its since been over months and they still will not allow me to pay them as i cant pass a security check on my own account to pay my own bill i have now received four months of a bad credit report due to a bill im trying to pay i have mental health issues and this has caused me so much anxiety and stress i have now changed over to sky in hope that talktalk would now generate a final bill its been weeks and all i have had in the post is a bag to send back to the equipment my carer has phoned numerous amount of times and still cant pay the bill as they wont tell you the amount you owe them without passing security we are both left upset and frustrated and totally let down by a huge branded company we now owe over months worth of bills for a company im no longer with and still cant find a way to pay very disappointed and would recommend to any customer changing broadband not to go with talktalk,Bad
358,had a so so experience as customers internet cut out from time to time dropped out for whole weekends but the worst was when my contract came to an end they missed informing me until it was too late to give notice before a price rise came in and then cancelling was a massive pain the price they offered me as an existing customer was worse than a comparison site quoted for a new switch between suppliers regularly to get a good deal but i will never go back to virgin for anything,Bad
359,i dont know where to start with how poor this company are i read the poor reviews on here and probably shouldnt have gave them the benefit of the doubt but oh dear did i learn the hard a sim only plan on sat th july as it seemed a good deal now i know why its a good deal as nobody would touch this lot with a barge pole unless they were giving it away for on order that sim will be delivered in working days sim never arrived at all contacted them this afternoon via live chat and omg ive never come across such incompetence in my life it was a chap named ram and the only word i can describe him with is awful he told me he had with his back end team and the sim will be delivered today i explained that my mail had already been delivered for today by royal mail but he proceeded to tell me that he knew my postal deliveries better than me and it was still to come after minutes of this nonsense he finally admitted defeat and acknowledged there was delivery of the sim happening today due to this and the fact this guys incompetence had sucked the life out of me i said i was going to take my custom elsewhere and i would like the money i paid for sim up front refunded this is where things went from ridiculous to just plain not on i was asked to provide information i couldnt provide told to email addresses to request the refund as he couldnt access any systems it was just anything and everything to make life difficult so i ended up just raising a through my bank as that was easier than dealing with that asked to speak with a as per my rights he refused this and to top it off after all the trouble i had i wanted the chat transcript as per my rights again he refused this and said if i wanted that i would need to screenshot it all lol i would have had to take about pictures to screen shot all in all this is a sham of a company and please do not waste your time even trying them the bad reviews on here are true and i would question the authenticity of any of the positive reviews on your reply makes absolutely zero sense just like everything else you do today was the rd working day and the sim did not arrive ive got zero interest in having a sim from you now after all this your customer service is the worst ive come across and you couldnt be trusted to run a sim cards after a week and driest work no data on the card and told it couldnt be sorted over the weekend as the back office team dont work honestly this lot should not be allowed to trade and should be closed down avoid at all costs,Bad
360,ever since getting upgraded to mbps months ago we have had shocking wifi running some times as low as mbps and cutting out times a day i have spent hours and god knows how much cash on chasing virgin and they have not been able or willing to fix the problem they do have one brill engineer called johny who was very helpful but the rest has been rubbish the service has not once reached the min speed not even close,Bad

366,you never get signals in many areas and if you go some park far from city you will never have internet,Bad
367,this companys customer care can only be described as shocking and disgusting i would give it if i could the way they treated my wife and i at their store a few months back was a disgrace and we only went in to pick something up spoken too and treated like a piece of rubbish too long to go in too but we received many apologetic calls from their directors office i told them to keep compensation and they refused to cancel my contracts as im ashamed to be associated with them they are well aware of my complaint but nothing changes the amount of bad reviews left has even shocked me they dont deserve our loyalty and custom ill never use them again,Bad
368,a marked a turning point with our service with virgin media i called up their accounts and retention department saying i need help as our contract was about to finish after half an hour on hold the conversation started by them asking how was i finding their service and how long i wanted to extend my contract its was with great pleasure i then told them i had no intention of renewing our contract regardless of what was on offer then came the question why what was the reason for me not wanting to renew the flood gates opened and i reeled off the very long list of faults the weight had been lifted off my shoulders i am so relieved that we have finally left what we found to be such an abysmal self importance lying unhelpful uncaring slow non responsive company in the end they lost and gained poor word of mouth from a very disappointed and disgusted customer so the reasons why you should not even think of joining virgin media or even entertain the though or name and these are from our experience and our opinion broadband you dont and are unlikely to get the speed they quote when the sales guy visits far far below signal continually drops off buffering is a regular event devices disconnect regularly the signal will not reach as far as they suggest you can not always connect to the hub nothing streams seamlessly i found connecting via my mobile phone provided a far better service and speed beware none of their speeds are guaranteed other than abysmally help line can be of little help if at all calls disconnect regularly you can take up to an hour to talk to someone no one person will solve your problems they are rude they will disconnect you for no reason difficulty in being understood communication problems with the different countries recommend recording all calls as evidence managers are rude disrespectful and lie they enjoy trying to talk over you raising their voice and try to beat you into a corner they think customer service is about being rude and trying to belittle the visit good luck appointment window unreasonable large hard work to will always be increased with no explanation ends up more expensive in the long run than other services it is not value for month low cost period is just a sweetener then shoots up if you dont buy in for another period of pain and regularly freezes the channel you select may not be the one you see or record pictures regularly jumps voice and picture out of sync recordings will just they remove channels tv boxes freeze regularly reboot very slow to respond not a user friendly system recordings or become locked so please please please think twice three times before joining virgin media my comments echo the majority of other dissatisfied for a reason our experience is one i would not want anyone else to go through my comments may sound bitter and but they are what we found first hand from this company,Bad
369,was sent letter saying needed to up grade system fitted new modem and router router needed app to work didnt have smart phone so router wouldnt work was sent another router this didnt work was told possible modem fault had new one fitted still didnt work was sent another router got it all set up when modem fell of wall pulling out fibre wire reported it had no reply for days so had enough of being passed for to talk talk saying it was each others fault so i had no internet from may june cancelled account gone with another company had internet up and running in hours,Bad

371,i have contacted virgin media and asked them for a lower package as i cannot afford the current package pm i asked for a cheaper deal at per month that i saw online i was advised that this deal is for new customers only they advised me that they cannot do me a cheaper deal even if i lose some tv channels do not bother with this company as they only look after new customers they do not care or look after customers who have been with them for over years they tired to give me a package which was more expensive than the one i am currently on,Bad
372,the superfast broadband i pay for rarely comes close to advertised speeds and is useless most evenings and weekends will briefly be adequate if you register an issue online and the go through the rigmarole of turning off the hub and waiting for it to reset last time i spoke to technical support in s africa the woman was patronising before hanging up ive been a loyal customer for years but i will be leaving asap,Bad
373,i set up tv and broadband with virgin months before moving in to my new home i booked to have everything installed the day before we moved in they texted me on that day to say that they were not ready to install and there would be a further month delay thinking they had plenty of time to get this all ready i decided to just cancel it since i had heard that their wifi was unreliable and i was just fed up at that point i called up to cancel and spent another half an hour on the phone with someone convincing me to stay i understand its their job to sell me their service and urge to me keep using them but after the th time of say please i just want to cancel my account they still would not listen i ended up saying that i found a cheaper deal with another company i hadnt but i just wanted the phone call to end and they were telling me they could match the fake price that they gave me this really annoyed me because if they could offer me these services cheaper why didnt they in the first place why is it i have to threaten to leave before i can get the better deals after quite a while on the phone i just got fed up and lost my temper they just would not accept the fact that i wanted to leave avoid this company at all costs,Bad

375,i attempted to perform an upgrade online on the th june to a new tariff which should have been gb g uk data uk minutes unlimited uk texts for a month i received an order reference of web for this despite the online order confirmation stating great news your new bundle will take effect in the next hours this was not to be the case upon logging into my vodafone i saw a message stating there are currently no services being used on this account i could not see any previous bills direct debit details anything my account had seemingly vanished i tried to resolve this using web chat to no avail being told by a customer service agent i have made the changes now just give it another hours this was not the case another tried to tell me simply resetting my password would fix it it did not i tried to resolve this again using web chat and again no progress was made the agent confirmed the upgrade had not been processed as when i asked what tariff appeared for my account he gave me the old one i then called customer services on friday th june this time someone actually did look further into the issue and it transpired the new bundle had not been applied due to the order being stuck in status open the person i spoke with assured me she would get this issue logged and ensure the order was processed that same day on monday th june i was again seeing there are currently no services being used on this account within my vodafone i still had not received anything from vodafone either by text or email to confirm my new bundle was monday th i called customer services again to be told that there was certainly an issue as there was no tariff existing on my account i held whilst the agent spoke with another team to ascertain how the issue might be resolved eventually being told they would have to send me out a new sim in order to correct the issue whereby my new bundle had not been applied to my account i got the new sim put it in my phone followed the instructions in the leaflet which came with the new sim and still had the very same issue still there were no services associated with my vodafone wrote a letter of complaint to the connection their head office sent special delivery never even got a reply despite royal mail providing proof of delivery and signature of continued trying to sort the issue out calling vodafone and speaking with someone in the upgrades team again on the th june demanded a pac code he was very apologetic and offered me a account credit if i stayed and a discounted rate on the tariff i had tried to upgrade to on the th june said he could see the issue with the account and would have the new tariff added to my account at the discount rate and just give it hours all would be good again again on the th july again speaking with upgrades team i was told this time the account could not be fixed using the systems available to him and the account would have to be referred to the back office team they would get the tariff which should have been applied on the th june added to my account at the original price of a month but with twice the amount of data per month than was originally quoted as way of good will he said all would be sorted in business days and this delay was necessary because the original tariff would have to be reinstated before the upgrade could be applied and only the back office team could sort out my thought this was the end of a week process to get a simple upgrade processed how wrong was i th july no data on g or g i have now cancelled but this is the best bit because of the issue where my account has no services or tariff attached to it due to the ongoing issue i cannot get a pac i have had to request cancellation with disconnect and get a brand new number on a new cannot understand how this shambles of a company exists,Bad
376,an awful company that does not have basic business ethics and rules the worse customer service i have ever had no email no contact address no online live chatting are we in the only way they treat their customers to get in touch with them is calling but if your call could be answered in minutes then you were lucky being a stupid customer of disgraceful virgin media for years i hardly believe that virgin media is a british companythe customers are leaving virgin media and we are pleased to be going,Bad

483,currently moving homes to a house that has bt broadband service they refuse turn on my internet for weeks after my move in date internet is there and available previous owners were using it so no engineer should need to come out should just be able to plug in my hub and have internet bt doesnt care about their customers or they would sort problems like this out easily,Bad
484,terrible company and even worse customer service doubled the price of my last months bill after claiming in the contract the price wouldnt increase until after the contract period ended with the only option out of it being to cancel prematurely and incur an early cancellation fee after ringing up and being kept on hold for over an hour i was passed around departments numerous times and had my time wasted by advisers who were condescending and repeatedly tried to make me justify why i was leaving and then patronized the answers i was being forced to give paying customers should not have to put up with this i wouldnt use virgin media again even if it was free the broadband has been inconsistent and im amazed to say that somehow the talktalk contract i was in before it was much more reliable and when i decided to leave they respected the decision and let me end the contract without any the worst experience ive ever had with a service and im sure ill get a style response to this like every other frustrated and ripped off person who posts one of these know your company and service is bad when you make people who never even write reviews write reviews so disappointed,Bad
485,terrible response to their network being down next to no compensation for years of problems ive left them now,Bad
486,the worst company i have ever dealt with every time you deal with anyone at the company for support they try and sell you something you agree to things over the phone which they then dont do they are a joke just avoid literally any other phone company would be better than the garbage service i have been given,Bad
487,would give them if i could terrible service cancelled my order without telling me only been waiting months for a new connection,Bad
488,in january it came to my attention that i had been paying for an o contract i believed cancelled about years recent years i saw it on my bank statement and had in mind that it was my wifes phone contract however in january i discovered she is with cancelled the direct debit as i couldnt find an easy way to get to talk to the sent me a payment reminder that contained my account number the phone umber is long defunct so i finally was able to make the course of the next three months i have made towards a dozen phone calls to them to get the account closed and the remaining balance rescinded originally i wanted a refund of the approximately i have paid them in return for no service at allon every single one of these phone calls i was promised a return call to update me on the have never received a single call few weeks ago i was finally told that credit was applied to my account and that i would receive payment to my bank account of around the excess from the refund by this time i was so frustrated and annoyed at the whole process i decided to let the go and settle for i have received a letter from a debt collection rang o on monday and they said the credit had not been approved so i still owed the and by the admission of the advisor they made no effort to inform me of this situation and instead let it sit until the automatic referral went i spoke to them on monday i was assured that the matter would be settled and he would call me on tuesday with an he hasnt called and i have no just received a further bill for a further month even though the account was supposedly closed in now leave me no alternative other than to file a complaint with ofcom and seek compensation and repayment of the full owing amount via small claims,Bad
489,what a bunch they managed to somehow scramble one account into two when a friends husband died and now they cant tell me who to contact to resolve it,Bad
490,terrible service engineers dont show up waiting times up to minutes customer service team throwing me from one member to the other different messages from different team members i have moved home for a month now with no internet ridiculous service,Bad
491,scammers fishing for contact details be warned,Bad
492,bad service agreed a renewal price for package over the phone and then charge you more and said they cant offer that price also they never get back to as promised the promise the world and deliver an atlas,Bad
493,signed up with vm a few weeks ago specifically asked them to keep landline number as i had had it for years and it was important for business they switched it to a new number without telling us lost business and total ball ache and the customer service in trying to rectify it is as bad as i have ever encountered hours today and havent got through security i dont know my password they never set one up i dont know my account number they have never sent any correspondence with an account number on so they cant actually do anything a company created by a kafka fan utterly breathtaking useless avoid avoid avoid,Bad
494,i dont know where to start we have received such poor service from bt all round it took them ages to get our phone and broadband working literally about months before it worked properly then came the silly bills one of them was over what it should be they charged us for an engineers visit to a neighbouring property others were over by in fairness they did credit us after spending hours on the phone to someone who could barely speak english i cancelled our direct debit after that and paid manually i just didnt trust them then this month i was a bit late paying the bills we have gone through a very busy phase i had the bills on my desk to pay them today once i could work out why wed received reminders for different amounts than was on the bills however bt decided to just cut off our cloud phone this morning with no warning i called in and paid the bill after being on hold for minutes only to be told they wouldnt turn us back on for upto hours so our little business that depends on the phone lines working has been without a phone all day needless to say this is the final straw and we have someone coming around to sign us up to a different company tomorrow,Bad
495,cancel your card and take the sim out of your phone right now is a fraud,Bad
496,connection is total every time we call for help they say that our connection is fine and that it is hitting the numbers that it is supposed to we used to pay for a connection that was packaged as x slower that was infact more stable reliable and much quicker useless customer support and awful internet,Bad
497,i have not used bt for around years now and left because of the scam emails the advertising emails and the hoax calls i was getting all on a fairly regular basis i led a happy years free of all of the above until a few weeks back when a friend asked me if i had sent him an odd looking link from a email address he thankfully didnt open it nor did i i then went onto the old account and realised i had not closed it and a second email account either i closed them the second account which i had attached a new second account to for forwarding began to get swamped with scam spam phishing only a day later did bt then text me to say your accounts have been closed by bt as we suspect they have been i see i close them they say they closed them and what on earth is going on these accounts have not been active for five years this means no activity and this means someone at bt has got into orphan accounts and then attacked any addresses this is evidence that bt is itself hacking with employees in india paid little selling email addresses and gets me is how they can get into these accounts which they do without a password or do they actually know the password it is time bt admitted what many of us have suggested press too that their staff in india cannot be trusted and thousands hundreds of thousands of email addresses are sold for fraudsters to attempt to annoys me even more is the kind of junk coming through isnt just the lying bitcoin and gift cards but porn too this is doubly worrying as i could be a child this is where bt need to be dealt with by and fined massively and ordered to put this situation right,Bad

499,this wifi is genuinely sit like the i cant even play gta online keeps saying disconnect and y tf is no one talking abt this sit wifi everyone mocks talktalk for being sit but tbf talktalk prob works better than this utter dog crap,Bad
500,absolutely disgusted with the lack of support from talktalk following planned maintenance in my local area which caused my broadband to disconnect weeks later several hours of telephone calls multiple promises of fixing the issue within hours its now hours since i was first advised this and still no broadband finally spoke to an advisor yesterday who assured me the issue would be resolved within hours yeah right to receive a call from the engineer at the local exchange to say he was unable to investigate the fault as talktalk had requested the wrong type of engineer if i could i would have awarded talktalk stars for this review,Bad
501,this is possibly the worst company i have ever had the misfortune to deal with the broadband speed is slow and unreliable and the customer service isnt any better when i tried to leave they put just about any possible obstacle in my way after multiple phone calls it still hasnt been resolved and i keep receiving bills for a service i no longer have or receive i most certainly wont be going back to them and my advice to anyone thinking of joining virgin media is avoid at all costs,Bad
502,price rise mid contract price gouging at its finest will leave as soon as im able too,Bad
503,i bought a phone from you and the phone is not working as it should,Bad
504,bad internet often turns off,Bad
505,dreadful wanted to cancel my contract as shed died over two months i had phoned them times sent emails and written a letter that was signed for at talktalk their response was always nothing eventually just cancelled the direct debit immediately received a letter saying theyd take me to court for not honoring the contract i relished the chance to talk about them in court five days before the court date i received an apology and the court appearance was cancelled words cannot express how bad this business isas you can see tt responded to this review but now im forced to use facebook whatever happened to email,Bad
506,wednesday vm came to upgrade the local exchange turned off our internet as part of the upgrade i was working from home and went to talk to the contractors who said my internet would be back on in a few hours by pm there was nothing and i was ringing vm about the problem no worries they said things would be back up in hours then at pm it was the same another hours then at pm worse news they would have to send someone out they said but that would not be until nd december what i said your contractors have made a mistake with the upgrade why do i have to wait i rely on the internet line for some client services i rang and spoke to donna a supervisor she understood as her husband worked from home and she promised to send someone out on thursday morning thursday morning and i was in london on business i rang vm at am no they couldnt send someone out until nd i was livid and spoke to another manager my wife rang an hour later and told me that a vm engineer had arrived and told her that the internet was on the reason was the in the upgrade the contractors had not taken the film off the end of the cables going into the local exchange great i said but there was no internet i rang vm again sorry they said we cant do anything until nd december i told them that we were leaving as they were punishing us for their contactors mistake thursday night hours after their contractors mistake they still could not rectify the problem remotely they rang me back at midnight great to tell me they could do nothing how it is reasonable or tenable for them not to rectify something they have done to stop the services i pay for is utterly outrageous the upshot of this is that they will lose the contact with us and they will lose s over the next years awful customer service,Bad
507,may be cheaper than other networks but you get what you pay just registered a new phone with them and topped up on my credit card they have taken the payment twice and despite providing them with all the details i still havent got my money back as they say they cannot see the charge a different operator replies each time and they clearly dont read what was previously written as they have contradicted themselves,Bad
508,worse services ever im out of this company u get a discount for the poor service and slow speed is probably the most they can deliver what a laugh r on mbs and with no exception for the last near two months we r kept at crap they r basically stealing money might as well bring us down to u dont exist for me no more,Bad
509,have been with tt for years but just dont try to speak to them im afraid to move cause i could not go through the pain of set up again,Bad
510,penalised for paying my bill early not allowed to upgrade coz i dont pay by dd i pay as soon as the bill comes in,Bad
511,just signed up for faster fibre but over the period before installation of new hub engineers managed to lose me my internet connection while they started work on my line too early this resulted in much frustration at intermittently not emails for weeks and having to ask for rebate still waiting since then have had several losses of connection so am pretty fed up am thinking of switching to another provider although have been with talktalk for years am beginning to wonder why,Bad
512,poor customer service lacks understanding takes long and never resolves issues,Bad
513,its not the agents fault but advertising mbs and only guaranteeing mbs and saying average will be between mbs is just a waste of everyones time not to mention extremely frustrating,Bad
514,unfortunately i cant give less than one star in my opinion they are just some scams they are taking money from my account but no one knows where the money are going into my credit are not apparently they cant see it either in their system if any transactions have been maid not only it happened ones but twice first time i emailed them and got an email back a few days later giving me some explanations that were not answering to my simple question and now second time i call them stayed on the phone mins to find out that even tho i have been charged with they can only see just so my question is where the other transaction has gone its not really about the money its not that big amount but the fact that has been happened twice already and still no answer on this matter makes me go nuts ill definitely change the network it has been only a waste of money and time,Bad
515,by far the worst provider majority of time the network is very poor end up using wifi so much data goes to waste and a waste of a month,Bad
516,after being with talktalk for many many years i am now at the point of having had not one to shop around for the best deals everywhere i just stick with what i know and unfortunately i know that we are resetting the router and switching it off and on many times a day but apparently that isnt the problem apparently its the network says the operator that i spoke to and i must be im not patient anymore but im paying for the privilege i dont think so so its time to go elsewhere so i called to say that i am leaving talktalk at oclock and get a recorded message saying that they close at oclock please call back tomorrow this makes as much sense as a service im provided with none,Bad
517,trying to place an order for a sim only deal for my company not only the website doesnt recognise my bank details and wont let me proceed with the order double tripled checked the details and they are definitely correct but i also rang the help line a few times and it keeps cutting me off saying you havent chosen an option so we have to end your call there arent any options to choose from impossible to get through to anyone absolutely appalling service you have lost yourselves a customer definitely taking my business elsewhere especially after seeing the other reviews avoid,Bad
518,we had the worst interaction when joining bt the tie up or scape goat arrangement with is were connection less for weeks having to piggyback on wifi to work from home and just had repeated bare faced lying to me as they couldnt bring themselves to say they didnt know so just made up repeated answers that made sense to the individual but the two companies just repeatedly failed i have spoken with since actually quote bt as a standard when rating companies eg i mean company x or y is really crap but not bt i am tied in but not for long now,Bad

560,hopeless customer service wifi router and tech i have no complaint with the speed of the broadband my major complaint lies with the router the wifi across several devices windows android and apple would drop out without notice several times a day the issue was compounded by a total lack of customer or tech support only than that offered by an automated service which sent me into a continual spiral of endless resetting my router only to find myself back where i started with two kids of school age this was clearly not great during homeschooling and lessons being interrupted not to mention the constant teenage moaning huffing and accusations of being a poor parent yes my teenagers have little to no grip on reality like most others but it is an inconvenience that we could do i tried to contact virgin the only time i managed to speak to anyone was when my patience finally snapped and i decided to leave the contract early the final kick in the teeth is the decision to charge me an exit fee i will be referring this to ofcom come on richard this is no service for your brand to be associated with,Bad
561,after speaking with virgin media before my renewal date was due i made it known to them that i didnt want to continue using their services i was assured that this was fine and would be actioned a month later im still getting bills although my service has been restricted i make another call and was offered the chance to pay one months fee i subsequently agreed two months down the line im getting phone calls from debt collection agency and receive an email for bill of nearly i make another one call and was told my previous calls were not recorded and therefore they have no evidence that i had cancelled the service bear in mind all this time there was no service on the account as it was restricted a few months back i made another call today that the cancellation will take effect from tomorrow but the agent could not guarantee whether i would be charged more than the one months charge i had previously paid i dont understand how a company can be getting away with this making it so hard to leave and then charging you further fees join virgin media at your own peril,Bad
562,do not take contract with expensive and low quality you could get bunch of could give stars i would month with them was a hell account charged more every month even with bar charge had to call every month to tell them cancelled for no reasons always i had iphone pro max with them month contract paying for each phone plus insurance customer paying nearly for k phones not a problem this is how bill pay work i agreed i took it after months i lost one of the phones made a claim is now months and they dont want to cover the claim they are making excuses that the phone was used with another sim and i have said yes it was when i went on holiday but at the time of incident a vodafone sim card was used in it the one taken with the phone after a month of hell they say the phone was used after the time i reported it i have proof that i blocked the phone and sim and they still dont have an answer would never recomend vodafone the most company have to repeat myself all the time all them making up new rules,Bad
563,cancelled my tv service but want still bill me and then refund me next month,Bad
564,poor customer service poor refurbished phones wont honour repair on month old phones lie about the repair lie about warranty lie lie lie avoid,Bad
565,ive not had a single week where my internet had been up the whole time receiving a maximum of mbps download speeds and mbps upload speeds and constant drops in connection got to be the worst isp ive ever known and i regret ever choosing them,Bad
566,for the second time this week i was not called back on my mobile even though a hour time slot had been booked with a chat agent to progress another fault so i had to phone the helpline and waste more time waiting to get through no reason was given either time for not being called back but at least apologies were offered talktalk really must review its system for picking up booked call backs if they have one,Bad
567,i entered into an iphone contract with this awful company about months ago i reached the end of my tether today and phoned to set up a cancellation it would cost to cancel for a phone without a signal for month after month virgin provide an excellent signal to my other iphone and three provide ditto to my mifi it took forever x on my main line phone to get through to the relevant department they would not allow me to record a request for cancellation so instead i have the socalled customer service dept address i am not optimistic about being able to cancel it will probably take the outstanding months to get it sorted the is no doubt the x monthly fee for no service avoid vodafone if you wish to have a normal blood pressure,Bad
568,absolutely pathetic company was sold a broadband and phone package by salesperson for a fixed price for months now surprise surprise months later price for phone package has increased because the fixed rate is apparently for broadband only even though i asked repeatedly and was assured by the salesperson that broadband and phone is fixed for months never again company doesnt even deserve star,Bad
569,well where do i start firstly i strongly feel this website should atleast allow a star rating as i personally think the is too generous for can you look into providing this option please thanks so after reading through everyone elses reviews and hoping my ongoing issue months ongoing issue may i add would be resolved yet surprise surprise to no avail here i am adding in my two cents im aware writing this review like my endless hour long soul destroying phone calls to when all i want to do is watch towie wont get me anywhere it feels a bit better to vent especially now i know i am not the only unfortunate customer to be lured into their for half a year yes half a year i have had the of listening to a ripoff version of justin love yourself on repeat for usually an hour thats when i actually feel ive got through to someone whining down my keeps magically adding these data charges onto my bill totalling it up to the s i wont go into the technicalities as my sob story is pretty long but to cut a long story short this company is one big f f up the staff are rude and condescending it appears that actually communicating with each other and writing notes on the system of previous phone calls isnt the done thing with which means i have to explain every time my situation every time i speak to an agent joy to say im disgusted with the service provided would be an understatement and i would much rather s in my hands and clap then renew my contract with them next year good riddance,Bad
570,absolutely horrible company christine from complain department should never been allowed to deal with customers for years theyve been calling me and asking whether i want to update my contact then one day theyve sent sneaky email to inform tha contact expired they then increased my fees by without ringing me as theyve been doing this over the past years i fought hard trying to get extra charges back but they believe that they did nothing wrong avoid this at any cost,Bad
571,we have been with virgin for many years initially it was very good and no complaints from us over the past few years things get progressively worse never mind the large bills it is the service that is rank failure of service seems to outweigh a normal one when you eventually get to someone they ask how many users at a time we dont do gaming two of us should be able to browse the internet at once ridiculous question over and above anything is that you may be conducting a conference call or in an important appointment and it either fails or you cannot log in at all their contract is unfair and deceptive as intermittent faults are permissible if you lose service for several days hence you can have this problem then they say they have fixed it but within a very short time you get intermittent faults again after getting very irate they offered an initial compensation go figure for yourselves how they think this amount is worked out they agreed to increase their offer but only if you do not complain blackmail is a word for that tactic they cancelled the offer they have done nothing about our complaints we are researching other companies and are off with so many negative reviews this company needs to wake up or it will cease to reading the usual type of generic response from give you three scenarios and go to weblink which is impossible to do if you do not have internet automatic compensation if failure of service for hrs so you are without maybe hrs contact them and told all will be restored several hours later same thing happens a couple of days later oh it is an intermittent fault and the engineers are working on it that is their get out clause an intermittent but frequently recurring issue is ok to them it is in the terms of contract whilst we are on about terms of contract deceptive practice in february and i take this as one of their sweeteners my husband was told he could have sky cinema for six months after which he could cancel it he tried to cancel they refused saying it was a reduced rate and he was now in a contract until june infuriated he said we wanted to leave you cannot you are in contract we said they should note it on their system to cancel at that date we cannot put that on the system so no consideration for pensioners who really need to reduce rising costs where they feel they can yet again my husband said they were to note and get a manager to ring us within hours no surprise that the call did not transpire yet again so virgin media instead of replying to this review online with your so called solutions which may on the surface seem reasonable to anyone who is not one of your customers look up our name on your system and do what you have been repeatedly been asked to do ring us back and sort this,Bad
572,if i could give stars i honestly would i had been routing for this network for a good years despite everyone telling me how rubbish they were and now i see exactly what they mean ive only just gone and received the worst customer service ever in my lifethe staff was very rude and was quick to try and dismiss me without even hearing out my problem im not one to leave bad reviews as i never saw the point but today i just had to if i can save someone from joining ee then so be it all they care about is money and will lie to you just to get more out of you no value for money whatsoever i cant wait for my next billing period to come so i can pay my contract off and leave immediately,Bad
573,virgin medias customer service is so bad that its almost as if it were designed as some kind of joke i have literally never had a positive experience reps are hard to understand they do not understand the problem you are explaining to them and take forever to perform any action on multiple occasions i have had different staff tell me completely opposite information it is impossible to send them an took me minutes on the phone today to try and remove an incorrect email address that vm had added to my account im still not actually sure whether theyve fixed it surely hiring one competent person who can fix the problem in two minutes is cheaper than hiring who take fifteen times longer,Bad
574,decided to leave because of price increase received an email stating that i wont be paying any charges if i leave before april got myself organised and arranged for new and cheaper broadband service and then received another email telling me that i will be charged for leaving early so went online to get clarification and received very confusing message about how i shouldnt be charged but if i am i should contact talktalk,Bad

578,absolutely horrendous nothing is to upgrade from a standard hub to a smart hub fibre engineer came and installed the relevant hardware and noted some issues with the line he raised a fault with bt and said theyd be in touch to sort it before activating no issue as my existing hub still worked with no warning in the middle of the working day bt my original hub cutting me off from all internet i was told my smart hub would be activated days later leaving me with a day dead period on the day my new smart hub was meant to be activated shock horror it doesnt work no surprise as no one ever responded to the original issue raised by the engineer who installed fibre i now cannot get in touch with a single helpful person ive spoken to multiple people on bts useless chat function who cannot help they cant explain why they cant turn on my original hub to keep my internet running while this new problem is sorted they cant point me to the right person to help activate my new hub and the whole company is an absolute shambles im at a loss as to how to get in touch with anyone who is actually helpful im paying for fibre broadband while i have no internet and it honestly feels like itll never be resolved because they make it impossible to talk to a human being who is capable of understanding the issue and solving it g o o d l o r d avoid if you want to keep your sanity,Bad

582,worst customer service out of all the main providers will take ten times longer for even a simple fix to your account settings online oh and not forgetting that they sneakily start adding charges to your account for services that you did not sign up for in the first place tv boost and then youve got to put up with the constant drops in your broadband and internet speeds usually at the most times of the not change to talktalk unless you have alot of patience and time to waste ie waiting for hours on the weekend getting passed on to a neverending list of staff who seem to actually enjoy ruining your day and to be inconsiderate of our needs whilst on the phone with my contract ends i,Bad

592,dreadful dreadful dreadful worse customer service ever when you contact tt it is impossible to discuss or establish how to make a attempting to do this i was this is someone based in indian all their contact centres appear to be based abroad despite making over txt messages they would not tell me how to and to whom i should address my complaint and concerns it took over txt this the content of the txt are patronising they suggested the reason they hadnt replied was due to my slow response and that one of there staff was on his day off further they declined to give me details as they felt it was too complicated and boring finally a manger from the tech side contacted me she recorded my numerous complaints and let me that non of requests from the service had been recorded as such i really wish i hadnt switched i was without a service for three days it took of hours of phone calls a visit from bt and finally to be told my aerial wasnt receiving a signal i would have to pay them to come and inspect it this despite there reassuring txt i did not need the engineer booked to set up the service truely an experience i would not wish on anyone reported to ofcom and will do again with the knowledge they did not record any of my complaints,Bad
593,i pay for an expensive super fast fibre package with tv the service breaks down on a regular basis either broadband or tv i understand this to be overloading their capacity bandwidth for promise of faster speed this is a joke as they dont consistently provide consistent lower speed service customer service takes an age to get through when you do there is no constructive advice for the poor service they are providing i would recommend people any with a choice to avoid avoid avoid they hike prices up and provide inconsistent service for me they are only company that provides superfast broadband i really hate that i am in this position with no choice of provider due to the local bt cabinets not being updated ever to give me a choice this provides virgin with captive customers who they mistreat disrespect with poor variable and expensive when i move house having virgin media as the only superfast broadband provider would be a big negative mark against any potential sign up to virgin media if you have any choice,Bad

619,virgin media have just given me the worst customer service experience of my life you often have to deal with pushy salespeople who and fail to deliver long customer service waiting times and patchy service are unfortunately a fact of life in these times people failing to do their jobs happens every day its rare you get the triple whammy virgin media have delivered that over the past couple of just received the keys to a new rental property as were working from home at the moment getting the wifi sorted asap is a priority enter medias most aggressive saleswoman who i wont name but ill call her s from here on out s was given my number by our referencing agency with the promise of a bespoke deal she offers me what she frames as a deal of a lifetime for our broadband while aggressively trying to push a landline onto us i didnt think they existed any more but perhaps s has just stepped out of a time machine from well give her the benefit of the doubt for now i ask her for some time to think about it she agrees and i go onto here begins the first gave me the same deal as s tried to offer me complete with a welcome offer and no need for a landline both which she failed to mention she phones me back the next day and we discuss this flustered and confused she agrees to match the offer and assures me promises me that our property is already wired for virgin media a negative experience but no harm done the next day comes and we go down to the property for the first time we search high and low no virgin media socket is to be found irritating to be sure but something that can be fixed what was to follow can only be described as a kafkaesque nightmare i call customer service the first time i try i go to get hold of a person to book an appointment i get stuck in automated call hell and somehow get thrown out of the call with no progress attempt number i navigate robot hell and am put on hold for an hour and a half theres about call centres are mothballed fine a customer service agent picks up listens to my plight im very sorry sir let me talk to my colleague and well sort something out instead of putting me on hold he puts the phone down a technical error perhaps i try again another hour on hold and someone picks up its pm virgin media call centre closes at pm and god forbid that virgin pays its employees any sort of overtime whatsoever to sort pressing client problems in extra time so clearly the race is on a customer service agent picks up same explanation same request to go on hold this time she comes back progress but the time is now pm panic begins to creep into customer service agents voice she needs to put me back on hold again pm she returns pm right she says heres what were going to do ive spoken to the installations team and pm what we can do is get you beep beep beep sorry the customer service line is now closer please call back between a diligent employee foiled by virgins grubby penny pinching so what weve learned so far is its extremely easy to get hold of virgin when they want to take your money but like getting blood out of a stone when you want them to deliver the services youre paying for virgin phone staff will aggressively fleece you on price presumably oblivious that price comparison sites might exist and saving pennies on overtime pay for what are obviously diligent outsourced call staff who are almost certainly scandalously underpaid is more important than helping out customers good the next day comes and i girdle my loins and get ready to go back into battle its a monday and i have work to do i pick up the phone at am and dial the number will i have a resolution before i start my working day at am miraculously yes but thats where the good news ends i speak to a new agent i inform them of my predicament oh dear she says whats wrong i ask due to restrictions we arent doing any more installations thats been in place for a few days now the plot thickens we now discover that i was sold a broadband package using shoddy information perhaps s is as scandalously underpaid as virgins call centre staff and needs those commissions to make ends meet the only option is a cancellation ill put you through so at last a demoralising end to a colossal waste of time is in view the cancellation colleague picks up stopped installations you say thats the first ive heard of it ill speak to my manager so clearly internal communication is as bad as external comms cancellation goes through ive wasted five hours of my life and have nothing to show avoid these at all costs,Bad
620,extremely low quality of customer service close to illegal one of their agents actively used my card details to provide a service that i had not agree withthe matter was reported and escalated as nobody wanted to take any responsibility for what their colleague had done at the end i was provided with an asda food voucher so was obliged to go and use one of their stores in terms to refund my money back that was their compensation for this criminal i use them again no,Bad
621,read these reviews and thought people were exaggerating decided to go with bt wow absolutely terrible conned in every way by these gangsters tried to cancel and told im outside day period even though i only got it today they started the days from date of order and had to wait two weeks for engineer to install disgusting customer service he couldnt understand why i was upset about the day problem and overall the worst company in the uk,Bad

623,customer service is horrible we have been trying to transfer my number we have called multiple times a week for around a month now and they keep passing the call to others after saying the same thing over and over again to different people they would just hang up or say to wait hours to call back but it never happens we still havent solved anything,Bad
624,useless pay as you go weeks and said top up after only weeks gone back vodafone absolutely brilliant get ur stupid manager to get it sorted fraud,Bad
625,sadly their system froze so despite this being the th time trying to resolve my problem with them still no further forward than i was a week ago the line still drops when a phone call comes in and the service is still unfit for purpose being told to try again later seems to be the only real response which is frankly not an answer is it does not resolve the problem fill you with confidence or inspire you to recommend them to others and now the support team cant resolve the issue so ask the come on really,Bad
626,virgin awful i am disabled person every so often my landline phone stops working i have been with virgin over years but i cant keep putting up with bad service they told be they would attend then txt me saying changed to now its again im cant keep putting up with virgin media attitude incompetence i may have to try move to another landline to zack virgin of course thats already been done virgin have also asked if i wanted an earlier engineer appointment i replied yes they said ok we will arrange an earlier app on no one came when i rang they said no its on incompetent and its stupid suggesting phone do you not understand landline not working because of unreliability of virgin i phoned today see if engineer was actually going to attend was put through to indian call center couldnt understand accents still waiting for landline to fixed i am disabled person need phone ethan came virgin engineer fixed phone line ethan very helpfull attentive young man five stars,Bad
627,their website is a pathetic joke obviously no one at o has heard of beta testing it is truly amazing that a large company doesnt have management that demands that their website is functional they send you a verification code and then leave you no place to enter the code then try to get help for that bit of idiocy it just puts you in a loop to the same webpage,Bad
628,such a bad customer service doesnt even deserve star they were meant to transfer my line from sky when switched over to never did and i had to pay for both companies at the same time when called to resolve they want me print and send all copies and cant accept email took over hours on the phone and still not resolved thinking of moving back to sky,Bad
629,do not use virgin media star is too dealt with a more unhelpful customer service team our wifi has been disconnected for days now despite all our direct debits being paid i have been passed around multiple different agents all of whom have given a different reason as to why one reason being that someone has tried to set up a new account at this address which is absurd if that was the case i should have been made aware of this before my account was disconnected i have been hung up on numerous times and been given the answer there is nothing we can do currently on multiple occasions i work from home along with the rest of my house mates and have used all my mobile data meaning virgins lack of solution is costing me extortionate amounts of money in topping up my g whilst writing this i am still on hold to virgin and still have no wifi i want to warn people to stay away from this shambles of a business,Bad
630,i wish to my contract as i can get similar wifi speeds and any time calls from now for per month,Bad

632,terrible company cant be bothered going on about the ins and outs of my case but i cant wait to be rid of them,Bad
633,they are overpriced and their service is awful,Bad
634,seeing many reviews here which say they called customer service and were kept waiting over an hour pfft im currently in the queue and have been for over hoursthe reason i am calling them is that for several days my data has been alternating between not working at all or working at speeds no more than battery was at when i placed the call now its at lets see if someone picks up before it a lovely extra the music which plays while you are waiting is loaded with harsh static its assaulting on the ear i am sure this is not done on purpose to aggravate the callers and encourage them to cancel their call it just happens to do exactly i come to power ceos will be legally required to exclusively and anonymously use the lowest offered tier of their own lets see how mr branson likes being for hours while waiting for someone to explain to him why he cannot get online to get his work done,Bad
635,awful customer service i tried to cancel my order because of the delivery schedule but have not been given the order number after several hours i am still trying to contact a real person,Bad
636,slow connection very pricey for a connection so slow put prices up all of the time absolutely impossible to leave always asking questions why you want to leave then ignore you etc would not recommend iv been trying to leave this provider one whole month with no luck,Bad
637,very poor customer service been on several calls had emails that have promised one price which was never applied another email promising another then an email saying my next direct debit would be even higher than both emails then a letter saying my monthly payment would be moving to bath of which are extremely expensive and well above the promised in original email and contract they seem to tell you something on the phone and then not apply it its misleading and disingenuous,Bad
638,dear sri gives us great encouragement to get positive feedback from you please do recommend us to your friends and family we will ensure that they too receive our signature regards ram team,Bad
639,extremely angry with the service i have received the managers read off a script and all say the same thing i have had intermittent issues for months engineers to my house and still having issues they have the audacity to make me waste hours on the phone at a time and run around looking for a screwdriver to open a socket like im an engineer then tell me if i dont ill be charged quid then quid if i dont make the appointment but wont let me leave the contract unless i pay pounds what kind of nonsense and they never call back or help with anything worst company ive ever come across,Bad
640,terrible experience with talk talk after nearly being with them for a decade they have failed to offer me a decent service i am leaving as i am not prepared to be bullied to accept their awful prices for their existing customers when contacted customer service to discuss this matter i received a more expensive offer than i already received via my own talk talk account how is this possible are they not looking at their customers profile the number of times i contacted them and they failed to properly deal with simple requests is shocking,Bad
641,i am a new customer trying to get connected i selected an install date of th nov missed rearranged another date th november missed contacted customer services who were very nice but they are clearly reliant on absolutely no back up at all from the company they have plucked the th nov from somewhere i contacted them and promised a call back which i guessed wouldnt happen they never called me have given them my mobile my email address absolutely no say i am suffering from customer service fatigue would be an thought of calling them is worse than trying to make a doctors appointment if virgin media do respond then please dont suggest i call you like you do to everyone else on here as i have already done that in different and actually want someone to call me or email me with a sooner installation date as promised timesi initially logged on and placed my order on rd of october my virgin account number is you can see from the response below after giving out my virgin account number they still havent got the brains to contact me using that information see what i have to put up,Bad
642,if i could give a minus i would virgin transfered me over to these clowns terrible customer service they cant speak english properly and cant understand me what im requesting tried to put me on a dearer tariff with less data its not even a week and im moving to a different network i imagine i wont be the only ex virgin customer to leave o my advice steer well clear off the muppets indian customer service equals soon to be no customers,Bad

644,for the last week broadband keeps dropping for at a time virgin appears oblivious,Bad
645,disgustingly awful they shouldnt be able to be a company money grabbers they will try and shaft you if you tell them you dont want to renew i got through to a member of staff who was only willing to help if i renewed my contract when i said i didnt want to he told me i had to ring a customer service member the next day if talk talk where the only internet provider i would still not use them dont go with this company anywhere but these,Bad
646,have issues fault on line for over a week fault tracking says in progress contact our team with link below only problem is link is not working and there is no option for live chat anywhere,Bad

648,i reported the problem on nd september on a mobile as i couldnt understand a thing they said engineers and several emails later and the problem is still ongoing bt keep promising that their engineers are working hard to fix the problem well i can see the problem from my window and so far no engineer has been near for weeks all they do is lie they dont care that the phone is our lifeline we have my husbands year old mother living with us and as she has recently had a stroke and has vascular dementia we need the phone in fact she has only just come out of hospital but even when informed about this they still give stock answers the next fix date is th october but i hold no hopes that they will ever turn up,Bad
649,website tells you not to call unless its urgent and you can do everything online but the account management doesnt work and when i try to change my packages it says its not possible so then i phone and am on hold for ages with no answer now being overcharged for sport and entertainment which i cant cancel,Bad
650,dont use them what you agree dose not mean you will get the price you agree does not mean the price you will be charged live chat is a waist of time no way you can cancel the service if you are not happy,Bad
651,i pay for broadband service virgin connected us to the neighbours property the neighbours complained about their split signal they got virgin to disconnect us i am now without internet until the cabling to our property is finally properly sorted while still paying for a service and finding myself with no internet connection for days which is highly problematic for me virgin have to much power and no work ethics or sense of service its a huge ma june unable to deliver the service they promised and should not have such a share of the market to avoid whenever possible,Bad
652,so virgin look after their long term customers by hiking the prices up every year in order for me to even stay remotely close to the monthly amount paid last year i had to give up half my service and this last week my internet keeps dropping while i am trying to work from home if there was any other option in the area i live to choose another provide i would their customer service through my renewal was shocking as i was promised packages by a rep that he couldnt deliver and in correct contracts later they finally included the sports i said i wanted to keep all along it took me hours in total over several different phone calls and internet chats to get it sorted to sum them up they are as useful as a chocolate fire guard,Bad
653,i have been trying to upgrade my broadband and phone account this weekend and have found the whole live chat very frustrating and in no way is it user friendly it is also not helpful when advisers end the chat early and you need to start again or as happened last night they dont respond at all it could have been done so much easier and quicker by telephone after thinking everything was resolved i then received a confirmation email which was have been a loyal customer of talktalk for many years now and would expect better customer service than i have just received,Bad
654,hi we could get you the information you needed social team,Bad
655,everyone has been really good but our problem is not sorted we were promised sky sports for months but no one seem to be able to get it,Bad
656,i have had out of customer service agents who were rude and didnt know what they were talking aboutthe main problem has been broadband speeds being between mbs and mbs while paying for mbs there terrible product only guarantees mbs so it shouldnt really be advertised at i have yet to receive anywhere near this advertised router they have provided is awful and needs resetting every week or so to maintain even moderate am stuck with bt as virgin is not in my area as i am in a new build home as soon as virgin is available i will be switching years of consistent broadband speeds with virgin and now i have to deal with a terrible and inept bt service awful,Bad
657,im struggling to know where to begin here last year it took weeks to initiate broadband despite numerous visits from engineers we live in cornwall and engineers were sent from as far away as sheffield to visit and attempt a fix thankfully no problems with internet service provided apart from it being an extortionate price and were stuck in a contract till next may current concern is that our new bill has increased by per in their infinite wisdom have decided to charge us for not one but two b t sports packages weve got sky and have never used or been contracted to any bt tv packages albeit a free offering as a current bt customer its taken me days to eventually speak to someone who has now resolved my concern and removed additional costs one of which was a charity donation to a supporters club to which we never agreed as it was never really feel for the customer advisors at bt who will always be marked down when asked how did we do they have always been polite and professional but their systems let them down ie why do we have to repeat details every time youre passed to another department it just exacerbates the whole problem so beware people and make sure you check your statements regularly and should you need to discuss your concerns allow yourself plenty of time and if youre promised a callback from a manager dont wait in as we did on two occasions as they never callback i can see why they are rated as the worst isp as their customer service is absolutely abysmal and like many other reviewers on here if i could rate them stars or even minus i would,Bad
658,cancelled my initial order without my permission when i reordered i was told to be available for an engineer visit otherwise i would be charged since then i have had a nightmare getting them to confirm that a router will be sent out before the visit it now turns out they wont be ready and there will be no appointment their customer service has been appalling and i will be cancelling my order once i can get hold of them,Bad
659,just too slow minutes of trying to access my account never got to the discussion of my renewal so you have probably lost a customer,Bad
660,your customer service is farcical as you get passed from department to department and spend hours wasting your time talking to people that are not interested and just want you off the phone,Bad
661,my fibre cable was damaged further down the road i was told it would be the next day i have now had appointments where a virgin media engineer did not turn up no contact from vm no text saying they couldnt visit each time i have to stay home in case they actually honour their appointment if i talk to their offshore support they just lie to me and say someone will arrive they dont terrible not use vm for fibre until they are you telling me to use see response below when i have already contacted vm support many times and raised a complaint all with no answer,Bad

666,well what can i do but reiterate what everyone is saying the customer service with talktalk is awful it was when my mum was with them years ago and it still is today the price is good which is why i went with them and their box was appealing yet after having it for months and deciding the other day that i wanted to treat my son to the kids boost realised i couldnt add boosts even though my internet speed was more than sufficient apparently there are two different packages both cost the same but one allows you to add packages and the other does not was not told this when i signed up last october was told i could add any boost i liked false advertising im attempting to resolve this issue with the talktalk forum as i do not want to call them directly after receiving such terrible customer service over the phone previously the customer service i received upon joining talktalk was appalling to say the least had no main phone socket in the house but was told that when the engineer came to install the tv he would install the main phone socket too he arrived and was very confused as he could not do that id been waiting weeks for a phone line internet and television id moved house and only had a bt vision box which i could not use in my new house and so i was left waiting even longer phoned up the customer service team who could not understand my problem and i could not understand them to arrange a phone socket to be installed and rearrange the tv install i was told that i had to contact bt for them to install the phone socket and was given their number phoned a confused bt adviser who said it was of course talktalk who were responsible for this so called talktalk back spoke to two other advisers both couldnt understand my problem and i could not understand them either but eventually got there and was told that at some point i would receive a text about the phone line installation never got that text just a random knock at the door one day from an engineer to fix the phone line and was given an incident number to rearrange the tv installation was another issue phoned so many different numbers to rearrange the engineer visit very stressful indeed of course i had no phone so all of this was done on a mobile did not realise until after all of this that there was actually a contact number for mobile callers this all cost me a lot of money and i was also paying for a phone internet and tv service that i was not receiving im doing an open uni degree so internet is imperative i did not receive any goodwill gesture or any repayment of costs from mobile calls or the internet that i was paying for and not receiving absolutely terrible never experienced such awful customer service in my life im not racist in the slightest but all the advisers i got through to were foreign they could not understand me even though i speak standard english with no strong accent and i could not understand them as they all had strong indian accents this has also been the case for everyone i know who has been with talktalk communication problems talktalk may be cheaper than bt and definitely cheaper than sky but their customer service is ridiculous bt customer service is very good talktalk should take a leaf out of their book,Bad
667,gone down hill fast theres always problems trying to add credit on payg on their website i know my log in details are correct but it always come up that its the wrong password or im not registered so i try and re register only to be told that im already registered tried to add credit on my phone and it wouldnt accept my postcode in the end i had to phone up and got some guy in india who talked so fast i couldnt understand him waste of bloody time,Bad
668,if i could give these cowboys zero stars then it would still be over marking without a landline service for over four weeks due to a fault which they denied was on their line three times through desperation i called out a local telephone engineer who within five minutes diagnosed the fault as being on their line he contacted them on my behalf and suddenly they accepted the fault was on their equipment i had to pay for this engineer then contact them to arrange an engineer visit to fix the fault and told that i would be charged if i missed the visit but nobody turned upi have tried countless times to contact them via email about my complaint and have had three replies saying that a manager would contact me within three days but the call never customer service dept complaints dept engineer visit dept and every other department are rubbish and a disgrace and talk talk have to be the worst company by far that i have ever had the misfortune to be involved in go near them at your peril,Bad
669,certainly not happy as we have been without internet since tuesday morning and despite making numerous phone calls and using the chat function on separate days we are still waiting for the issue to be resolved i have just been informed via the chat using a personal hotspot function to be able to connect that an engineer has been booked for this this has been very detrimental for us as we are a childcare setting and not being able to use the internet has been incredibly detrimental to our ability to function i am very dissatisfied with the lack of communication and slow response,Bad

701,please please please do not ever think of using talktalk please take minutes to read elderly mother had to move into a care home at the beginning of december last year and i have been trying to cancel her broadband account with them ever since i have the power of attorney over her estate and she had been a customer of theirs for fifteen years and was long since out of any binding any exaggeration i have spent in excess of hours on the phone with them over multiple calls have emailed them to explain times to their concerns email i have tweeted contacted people through linkedin and even written a letter and posted it off to them and yet still no joy i do not know the password to her account and she cant remember it she no longer has the mental capacity not is she able to speak to them for obvious reasons the password reset function if you have forgotten your password has an error message and genuinely has not worked since the first day i tried in december they do not understand what a power of attorney is not a single person who i have spoken there has the first clue what to do to help methe call centre is without a doubt the worst i have ever come across i am seemingly staffed by almost comically incompetent morons they are still chasing my mother for payments continually billing her and sending threatening letters fully four months later it is basically harassment of a vulnerable old is an utterly disgraceful shambolic bunch of incompetent unhelpful do yourself a favour there are so many other options out there choose someone else,Bad
702,the entire exchange took nearly an hour of my time between each brief exchange i was left hanging having stated the nature of my problem in the very first instance it was more than irritating to find towards the end of the exchange that i was being asked and what exactly is the problem you are having my phone details were taken so i expected the agent to say leave it with us well get back to you but no in the end i closed the chat myself pointing out that they had my details and could get back to me if ever they decided to i rather doubt they will and i am certain that my problem will never be utterly abysmal service designed presumably to put you off ever using it it not for the crippling charge for leaving this dreadful company i would have left long ago,Bad
703,honestly the worst company i have ever dealt with i have a simple internet only package and they just create mess up after mess up with nobody taking any responsibility for their wrongdoing the call centre are like robots who offer nothing but what the computer says they can do they cancelled my plan early only to try and charge me double to reinstate my services even though it was their mess up unbelievable tried arguing saying it was my fault too went without services for days and not even a reduction on my monthly charge was offered please for you own sake go and use sky who are in every way a far superior company with much better customer service,Bad

handled by the ceo we can not do anything about this for the the ceo team will be the one who will contact you with the but that is my point i have spent an hour on this chat and have got nowhere i need to speak to ceo im afraid we dont have a ceo department here graeme angela we have the fault management team which will check the open complaint and will be the one who will escalate this complaint to the it has already been escalated to ceo you have now reset your time hour response time by updating the you mentioned yourself that this complaint is now with the ceo team having said

team and this will be prioritized graeme i have just spent one hour and fifteen minutes on this chat and you are asking me to contact your technical tem to transfer me to fault management why cant you do this straight because we dont have a fault management via live what you are telling me is that i as a customer are not that important to we value customers like you graeme this is the reason why i gave you an alternative option for this issue to be resolved right away as for the live chat we will still have to pass this case to the fault management team and they will have to book the call back for you however if you call right away you will be prioritized and you will be able to speak with them ok what is their here is the number for technical support graeme and will they connect me to ceo this is a free call if you will call using your talktalk they will be able to transfer you over to our fault management team who has the way to contact the ceo you havent answered my question will i be able to speak to your ceo as mentioned earlier we dont have a ceo department here in talktalk however you can contact them directly on this number graeme that is not a talk talk number i have just called it and it is a communications and internet ad,Bad
706,i just want to express my complete and utter disgust at the way i have been treated by this company i contacted them on to set up a broadband package for my mother i was told in that initial call i was told that if i wanted to retain my number that i had to call virgin to request they port it over or give me mac code i called virgin on only to be told that it would be talk talk that would make the request i called you back the same day on the number given by the sales advisor and quoted the reference i was given none of their offshore advisors were able to trace any information about my application i spoke to or so offshore advisors before getting frustrated and asked if i could now make a complaint and that i wanted to now discuss the matter with a uk based advisor i was then passed through to an advisor by the name of from the loyalty team at a uk based site he advised me that he could not trace my account and that i would have to go through a sales call again and that to compensate me for the distress that he would add credit to the account i carried out a further sales call with you i was told that you would contact virgin on my behalf to get my number ported across great i thought i then logged on to the account online i was advised there was an issue with the order and to call you i did so and it was at this point that i discovered that i had account numbers and the former being the first account that had incorrectly been opened in my name despite the fact i advised i had called on behalf of my mother and the later correctly in my name i advised a uk based handler by the name of that i only need one account and to close the one in my name she did this and confirmed the credit had been put into the later account i left matters at that and again logged onto my online account again it was still showing an issue with the order i called them and was on the phone to two offshore advisors for nearly an hour and twenty minutes i was in helpfully told that the could not port my number over from virgin as a virgin had advised that a request had already been made i was then told that you would not be coming to fit my broadband on the agreed date of and that if i wanted to get this issue resolved i would have to call virgin i was shocked that this was the first time i had found this out and that no one from talk talk contacted me to advise there was an issue if i had not made contact at all with you following my nd sales call or logged on to the online account then i would have been none the wiser and my mother would have wasted a morning waiting for an engineer who would never have arrived again i cannot put into words just how upset i am at this whole affair i advised that i wanted to cancel all accounts with talk talk but that i still wished to complain about the way in which i have been treated this seemed to go completely over the head off your offshore manager was completely useless at dealing with my complaint so much so that im not even sure if he has cancelled the accounts i have spent literally hours on the phone to talk talk and some days after i initially contacted them im still not sure what is going on i have reached out to them on twitter their own online complaints team and have even gone to the lengths of making preliminary contact with ofcom over this issue i would not recommend them to anyone and would advise people to avoid them like the plague,Bad

746,misleading advertising and very worryingly unsecure unreliable online payment and ordering brief my experience has been an absolute nightmare rude and pushy customer services and more worryingly unsecure and unreliable online payment and data capture processes i ordered the talk talk per month broadband package via uswitch yesterday all seemed to go through online ok including payment details and i got a confirmation email see below i rang up the next day this morning to check which address the router would be delivered to my current address or the new one were moving into it took me an hour and different numbers before i could finally speak to someone the customer support line at every juncture kept asking me to enter my customer phone number i dont have a talk talk number and when i entered my mobile number it said not recognised but there was very little alternative and it was nigh on impossible to actually speak to someone eventually i did and explained my question about delivery address for the router she said i couldnt change the address i had given with the order not understanding there were field options to give addresses on the order form she then reluctantly looked up my order number from the confirmation email and said they had no record of the order on their system i then spoke to someone else in another department who said the same and both were a little rude about it this is very worrying since i had completed the online process given my debit card details and even fixed a date and time for the engineer visit all of which i had had confirmed by email regardless i rang up a different number yet again to place the order from the start since the online process clearly hadnt worked this is the real good bit i was told by the sales guy that the price doesnt include vat and that with vat its actually errr hold on the price is advertised as per month theres no mention of incl or excl of vat more importantly that would make the vat rate since when was vat so that was a complete lie then after a little prodding he to say the uswitch price is wrong and theyve been asked to update it not my problem its an advertised rate was the agreed and final price in your confirmation email back to me maybe thats why the order didnt go through yesterday because they havent updated the price at uswitch he chirps it did go through as a customer experience it went through you took my debit card details and confirmed payment and even a date and time for an engineer visit scary i would have been sat in my new property awaiting that very visit in weeks time like a total muppet with distrust coursing through my veins i said id rather rethink my options as the price had suddenly changed from the advertised rate and id had a poor experience with talk talk at this point he got quite pushy can i ask why youve changed your mind err yes you just changed the price but he says the uswitch price says router charge of and well do it for free were still the cheapest for broadband are you serious first the uswitch page has no mention of a router fee in fact it says no set up costs another lie and since when did a reduction in exchange for a increase per month over months make sense to anyone as for being the cheapest for broadband i just signed up with ee for per month including vat overall a terrible terrible first experience of talk talk full of lies and deceit and most worryingly unreliable online systems lord knows where my bank and personal details as entered may now be sitting so glad i didnt move all services to tt as id originally planned wont be going back in a hurry consumers should not be fooled by the prices which turn out to be utter rubbish oh and please give your team some manners mr,Bad

772,worst product ive ever had doesnt work business broadband which kept going down in the early days of installation had an engineer out twice within the first weeks guaranteed minimum is around mbps have been recieving mbps for the last few weeks progressively got worse over the up to get an engineer out took some information and suddenly my broadband went down completely said they would call me back on the same day friday didnt recieve a call called on monday said the same thing called back up and said theyd send me a text regarding an engineer engineer set for the following friday days without broadband for my business which is contingent on me having a stable connection called up they said theyd get an earlier date for me sent me a conf text with the same time called back said they cant do anything about put through to complaints to someone who was seemingly helpful telling me hed have his colleague call me in the morning who can most likely fix it no call followed up with back through to complaints different csr had to explain my issue for the th time couldnt find my account put me on hold and then hung through to saying i wanted to cancel arrogant sarcastic guy on the other end didnt care about resolving the issue just said hell cancel and id have to pay the remainder of the exit fees circa months left in contract saying they werent in breach of slas when i had stated exactly how they were started asking if they can put me back through to complaints as i thought id give it one last go contrary to what i was told by complaints advisor advised me that their department doesnt have the capacity to engineers nor help on to lose a ridiculous amount of revenue this week from my business in addition to damaging relationships domestic probably the way to go vms g emergency backup doesnt even work,Bad

776,i often work at night i need internet for this and of course i have to use my phone because they are doing something there i do not pay for not having the internet i do not recommend and i will not extend the contract,Bad
777,the customer service advisors lie and misled me i just wanted to stay with virgin media and wanted to change the name if the person that was being billed i explained i wanted to keep exactly the same package therefore i would keep my phone line with the same telephone number broadband tv package and the same equipment i ended up losing my telephone number because they made a mistake porting it this was totally unexpected because after all i am staying the same provider when i complained they said it will take more time to come over and then eventually after several complaints a member of the technical team was honest and told me my number has been lost this has caused numerous problems and headaches after several complaints and hours on the telephone the customer services team also said they would send an engineer out to ensure my equipment was set up correctly and works with other equipment i have that my previous set up allowed this engineer never turned up which wasted my day i have been with for years but i will definitely be leaving when i am able to do so even if they are cheaper than their competitors this is because of the terrible customer service i have received this is not the first occasion that i have received terrible customer service from,Bad

785,so after reading much reviews and searching around i decided to take the gamble with talk talk fibre broadband they say the first few day as may be a little slow so u have to give it some time to really see if its quick or not it turned out to be marginally faster than normal broadband and did seem to cut out a few times too over the next days of my trial so i was originally trying to speak to them as to why it keeps cutting out and could they fix the problem but i couldnt get through on the phone after numerous attempts to call so on what i thought was the th day and worrying about being tied in to these guys for months i thought right ive gotta cancel and change provider quick as if i have a problem and it takes this much effort to try and get through to someone then i do not have the patience for this i then go on to there live chat to someone who then asks me hundreds of little questions in the chat box about who i am etc my password my family details etc etc and so on then tries to diagnose the problem with these silly little chats so i ask can she call me as this is silly on here trying to work out whats wrong with your service she says sorry she can fix it on here so i say i want to cancel the service right away she then spends the next mins on this silly chat box asking me why i want to go and to stay etc i tell her that the service has not been great and that if i have to try and fix problems on your line like this ill end up pulling hair out and also my trial ends today and im certainly not having your service i cancel it and get a new and pay the months price of for the service ive used i have now received emails telling me of a cancellation charge of so after calling there so called customer service abroad it turns out i cancelled on the st day without realising so the charge stands and if i dont pay it will go against my credit rating there is also nothing they can do with the charge amount as i signed the contract and cancelled within it even though it was pm the next day and the service in the days i had received was shabby dont be fooled people and even if u have to pay slightly more i wouldnt go near talk talk unless u like problems fixed over chat transcripts never again will i be fooled,Bad
786,i have had pay monthly contracts with vodafone for around years now and i have finally decided to switch to a different provider i had contacted vodafone on two separate occasions to give my notice period of the current contract so that it didnt overrun and charge me double the amount i was originally paying i made sure to contact them at the day point to tell them that i want it to stop at the end of the contract and not to roll over to no surprise the contract has carried on luckily the person i contacted today was able to shorten the notice period to days so i dont get hit with an additional bill however i have still had to pay for an additional month i wont be using when she checked the chat history of previous communications nothing had been saved from the chat except that i had contacted them really disappointed in the customer service and think the contract was intentionally not cancelled so i would be charged i dont have twitter or facebook so that wont help,Bad

820,i dont know how the training mechanism works in vodafone and most of the csrs doesnt exactly know the package that they offer they provide wrong information over the phone just to cheat customers my internet package was for gb and the moment i received the usage i called up the customer care to change it to gb and he clearly said it will be only as ive changed the package in the middle of the cycle to my surprise i received a bill amount of including of capping charge which was not told by the csr this is how they are cheating people and this issue has been going on and on but they are claiming its a valid who said its invalid all they have to do is explain customers clearly so that they know how much they will be charged i suggest every one not to go for vodafone as it has poor service and csrs are unable to communicate in english to customers,Bad
821,we have intermittent service making it challenging to work from home i have been calling regularly to ask for help and you have not been able to resolve the issue i have been told that you have a shortage of home hubs and the call operators are dissuaded from sending them out to customers the two times we have had an engineer round they have not been able to solve the problem and finally i am paying for super fast but the internet speed is painfully slow you wont let me out of my contract so i am stuck with virgin media,Bad

826,terrible company they advertised service in my building i contracted broadband and when the guys came they said they could not install broadband in the building they then cancelled the contract kept my original payment by card and are now billing me for the cost of the open reach engineer and a cancellation charge do not recommend them at all,Bad

830,your sales team keep ringing my home phone every day to sell me products that i dont want i have pleaded with them not to keep calling but they refuse and call every day the only reason i have a home phone is in case of an emergency for my wife who is a transplant patient or my dad who has dementia and cancer yet none of this is taken into consideration and i still get called every day furious and disgusted this should be illegal to harass a person like this,Bad
831,bt has to be the worst provider ever looking at the star rating here says it all rock bottom i switched to bt couple months ago thinking my speeds would be better than talktalk or shell fibre but infact its much much worst when i was with shell fibre talktalk i was getting mbps and stable after swapping to rubbish bt british trash my speeds have dropped to mbps total rubbish and a ripoff at bt broadband dont waste your time and money with these scammers robbing baskets avoid or get scammed by bt british trash,Bad

836,i moved homes and request ed them to install broadband they gave me a false date and then kept changing it they kept cutting me off while i was desperately trying to contact them they promised me that i could keep my number and yet changed was all done by vodafone using their foreign call centres to do their work for them maybe they should try bringing some jobs back home to the uk like president am simply astonished how we in the uk put up with this lack of organisation and an incompetent service to go with it,Bad

905,being ripped off by i had written a review about being ripped off by ee who is now owned by bt effectively my complaint was regarding how i had been treated by ee trustpilot had said that i could leave a review about a complaint made against ee yet writing the review trustpilot had not allowed me to write a full complaint yet i can continue here complaining about bt where i had left off reviewing ee this review can be found by searching troubleshooting all the lines on the property and even to the extent of buying a new computer there was no fault found ee have their own callout repair service called cubic ee had said that they have analytical equipment in which to diagnose any problems no problems found the property bt had said that their equipment suggests that the problem could be on my property hence me buying a new computer and wiring this really had put me in the middle yet equally was playing ee i did not know at that time that ee had merged with bt yet i have always assumed that is just a contractor to bt so i could have effectively had been played by ee and bt and in this respect could not have been easy to be in the middle yet it did cost me for a new computer plus literally hours and hours on the played eg see ee response to my complaint on trustpilot hereunder ee they say that they are very sorry to hear about my experience yet just carrying the matter on the consumer is always at fault at the end of the day whether it takes weeks or years in which to rip you first point of contact with ee after going over everything after the junction box on the property that bt lines come into i had explained to ee that their super fiber was not improving the experienced connectivity issues that i was experiencing when after spending an unnecessary i had gone back to ee saying that i want to cancel fiber in all its positions here comes the plymouth had this to say that my contract had ended at the end of dec i had before that time been paying for a broadband package including phone calls per month then it went up to per month i was not informed that i was out of contract effectively i should have been informed that the contract was ending and that my line would be disconnected prompting me to contact ee nothing of the kind this had gone onto july when connectivity issues had soared and the culprit being owned by bt ee plymouth had said that i should give the fiber a chance that it takes around months to normalize had said that this comment was not true anyhow ee plymouth trying in which to resolve the issue had said that i would be but back at my old rate under contract when in dec of per month with an additional for the fiber making it per month this i had agreed to yet this did not happen what did happen ee had put me under contract at per month but with pay as you go phone calls i did not know anything about this until the beginning of dec some or months on a text message had said that my bill for dec was alarmed i had contacted ee and was told that phone bills from july were around per month one month was going into this i was told that i had phoned alot of numbers ee on numerous occasions has said that are free within the package yet i was being charged another had complained to ee that why should i want to go back to my original package fiber paying per month to then start paying on average per no comment any new contact no matter if it is a renewed contact should be signed by both parties as a binding legal document i had since july had been ripped off by paying over over more than than i should fact is that or whoever they are are not honest over the last years when phoning ee about technical difficulties i was either put through to of the time i could simply not understand what the person on the other end of the phone was saying eventually about a year ago ee probably due to many complaints had moved the calls to plymouth customer quality i thought had should be a provision and there is probably already putting the burden onto bt regarding the code of good practice which is a legal even so a clause can fall on the purchaser the court could say that i should have known my rights to have asked for a hard copy of the contract yet i would say that bt should not be allowed in which to operate without first giving a hard copy of that contract of good practice is supposed to protect consumers is a legal term,Bad

940,fraud set a cup into your contract else they will dig as deep as they can into your acc to take money out then they will lie to you you must be very firm and will take a lot of efforts to find a decent employee to be more honest and sort things out for you but you might not be able to find one if you dont check on your acc each month you give them access to your money and they will take out as much as it suits them until next time what an easy victim you will be,Bad
941,terrible service all around when i moved to london i was fooled into believing that ee were the top operator to join this is definitely not the case and if i can help anyone by advising them not to use their service then i will be doing them a massive favour ive been a customer for months and have had continuous issues with their service never dealt with such a terrible company in my life stay away,Bad

946,we had requested broadband and landline from virgin who advised that this would be installed in our business in date virgin had cancelled times while sending me confirmation texts that they will be visiting to install safe to say this was not the case and our latest chat with them confirmed they would next be attending in november after attempts for virgin to install broadband and landline we lost full faith in virgin and advised we wanted to leave them i would not recommend using virgin as they do not seem to care about their customers after complaining times to virgin i queried whether they have this on file to which the virgin staff member advised no complaints are on their system to me this shows how much they actually value your thoughts domingo was his name and what seems like someone not suitable to be an order manager we have now left virgin and went with bt will never use again,Bad
947,i wouldnt use orange again as i had financial issues and only two months left on contract i had explained my circumstances and said i was leaving them the women on phone had agreed that since i was facing financial issues i only had to pay instead of she took out of my account and the phone disconnected within hour like she said month later i get a letter from a debt recovery business saying i owe of which is for getting the debt company involved in my opinion never go with orange was with them for years and have just been terrible,Bad
948,massive con artist at the bluewater branch sneakily added wifi box contracts to my mobile phone contract without any mention of monthly line rental they put this in the bag with the mobile and said it was a little goodwill gesture because we waited for hr and mins in store for a simple upgrade i questioned the monthly amount sounded wrong when in store and also rang them immediately when i got home to double check as didnt sound right at all got off saying it was correct still no mentioned of the wifi box now i have recently received the monthly statement and they are now claiming i have made a contract for per month for this wifi box they stated they have chucked in for free i didnt even ask for it at all all i wanted was a mobile upgrade the complaints procedure takes a long time and if you can get though this is now gone to the regional manager and the shop manager is consistent on stating they will not cancel this wifi box contract even though its their fault completely sliding everything under the table if it means they are going to charge me for the next months i will spent that time complaining until resolve my aim now is to leave as many reviews about this as i am sure i cannot be the only person this has happened to soon as all of our ee contracts have ended we will not be returning just because of the way we have been treated and they have absolutely no idea about customer service especially business account customers its the way they talk down at you as if we got your money now got on with it well this customer aint having it and i will continue to take this further and further if they want to waste our money we will certainly get our moneys worth in the end watch this space now off to leave another review elsewhere and hopefully save someone else the bother of using this terrible company,Bad
949,without a doubt the worst broadband and customer services experience i have ever had i regret taking out the month broadband contact as a new home owner i was enticed by the low cost of a month for and free setup in months of service my internet has only been working for months and still to this day i have no working internet and i have never received a refund i have called countless times and they run their same minute diagnostic to check your connection each call takes well in excess of minutes only for them to conclude it is not working and to then have to find a time to send an engineer out i have had to take time off of work to be home to get this sorted and then when it was fixed it was only working for a few weeks before it broke again terrible service awful at fault diagnosis and incredibly slow to actually sort things out i was promised compensation and still to this day i am around months out of pocket i urge you not to be enticed by the low cost of this broadband its better to spend a bit more and have something that actually works,Bad

957,absolute worst broadband service on the planet do not buy if you have a sky decided to make the switch as they came in cheaper than sky so happy days the signal is less than poor from the main router so i decided to upgrade to their super internet lol boosters later and the signal still continuously drops none of the boosters work properly after hours on the phone i finally find out that if you have a sky box then it disrupts mesh system please advertise that before we buy that your service is a bag of poo poo the queues on the phones are hours long and the people arent even helpful and advise you to use the online chat which disconnects you the second your phone screen goes off and the people on there can hardly understand a word you are saying to them and quite frankly come back with complete gibberish i spent most of my hours talking to them getting passed around from department to top it off when i finally get out of my contract they have switched the line at am which is ridiculous we use our internet for white noise for our kids and how am i supposed to fanny about with this at in the morning i hope if you are reading this review you do not buy vodafone i had a phone contract years ago which i had a bad experience with and thought id give them a second chance but nothing has changed and if anything they have got worse with their lies,Bad
958,it was to my understanding that my plan included international roaming but evidently it does not im currently in kurdistan iraq imagine my upset when i realized that my cell phone doesnt work i will admit that i should not have trusted the information i was given when i researched the plan their customer service was awful from the start what i was told contradicted the information on their site which is itself a torture website they could barely answer my questions much less in a straightforward and manner for some reason i still believed them when they said id have the service i needed when i arrived in country outside the us the sim card was dead nonetheless when i contacted customer service they would do nothing to help me and left me stranded they clearly lacked skills and could only provide me with scripted answers accusing me of not having paid as the tmobile debits from bank website stared me in the face rattling off their script it seemed like they wouldnt even listen to what i was saying i dont think they even understood the problem tmobile truly has really bad customer service my own mistake for having confidence in them but its loss of a good customer this could have been a easy positive review from abroad for them,Bad
959,wow this is how you treat new up on vf website all good connection booked for today all documents and router received and set up numerous calls to vf and eventual forced escalation to cs team they told me the web site had not processed all details despite sending me router sms and emails with lots info now another two week wait hours of talking to people in escalation reluctantly offered me a mifi unit which may may not work due to living in black spot for mobile signals whilst wait another two weeks also signed up via mse link should get a gift voucher but bcos vf messed up my account they wont honour offered me a amazon echo instead currently can buy on prime day for wont agree compensation until resolved and connected tried get me to agree to a poor deal no connection for another weeks despite they breach contract have left complaint open and made clear would be going to ombudsman on this very very poor service communications and experience i suggest to anyone signing up via website to avoid and go elsewhere as not honourable company vodafone if you actually read this and want resolve see complaint ref,Bad

968,i have been a loyal customer for over years i wanted to downgrade my contract as i dont have a home phone and they are offering new customers a far better monthly fee i wanted to simply talk to someone it has been over a month some text contact that promised the world but then passed me on to a promise of a call hours later i am still patiently waiting and waiting and nothing poor customer service they are quick enough to upgrade but to change your package in the other way or to even question your monthly cost nothing silence,Bad
969,so far waited a month for tesco to transfer my number the need to transfer only happened in the first place because a member of staff in my local tesco changed the sim to one that tesco had sent that also wasnt necessary as i was only upgrading my package told matter in hand promised update within days which has not materialised in limbo now as cant do anything until number transferred,Bad
970,going into our th day now without internet atrocious customer service even at technical support level constantly told conflicting information by different support agents final got a engineer out who said it was not the fibre connection but the router unfortunately vodafone dont let the engineers carry them so back to vodafone support they are now unable to send a replacement as they dont have the engineers report was promised by the last person they would phone me back by the end of the day and when i said i would believe that when it happens she promised again and said if she says she will call a customer back she always does its now gone pm and she hasnt called vodafone at all costs as once they have your money they dont care about customer service or satisfaction,Bad
971,the my bt app is a complete waste of time ive had it now for year and can never find out anything about my account every time i log on i get a message oops something must have gone wrong you bet it has i joined bt peter lewis,Bad
972,continued taking unauthorised have recently cancelled my services with talktalk and they have continued to take two additional payments from my account they have said that they did not cancel my services but just did not renew the contract that came to an end i specifically called them to cancel my account as my partner took out a new account with a better fixed contract which was made very clear they have been taking two separate payments from exactly the same bank account for the past two months they try to scam you into continuing with them by not using specific terminology when you cancel which is completely unacceptable and deceiving it was completely obvious that we no longer wished to continue with the account yet they try to weasel into taking additional payments and make out as if they misunderstood what we meant if i wanted talktalk to continue taking payments outside of a fixed contract i would not have called them specifically to cancel the services they have said that they do not have access to the call which confirmed that we cancelled with them how convenient so far they have not refunded us for the payments that they have taken without our permission and i would absolutely not recommend talktalk services or their customer services as they have not been helpful at all,Bad
973,i tried to book in their broadband with them and somehow the person on the phone to me got everything wrong the delivery address i gave them the date it would start so i would incur a fee from my previous supplier and we were told we had to be in for the router delivery a couple of days later and then it turned out they wouldnt deliver it for another month so it was a complete waste staying in i dont understand how they could get everything so wrong whether they were either stupid or trying to make peoples life hard deliberately i cancelled in the end because how can you trust a company like that it would be just endless problems,Bad
974,notice bt doesnt have a google review account theres a valid reason for this it would be full of poor reviews just like this site i called to notify them two months before the actual contract end date i would not be renewing i was assured this would be actioned in time and my contract would not be auto renewed needless to say they didnt do this and have no issued me with a fine for nonpayment for the th month outside of my month contract along with the fee for that avoid avoid i can not stress this enough laughable company with a below par service stick with sky or virgin media,Bad
975,the most useless customer service experience known to man calls and counting just to speak to someone about a constantly interrupted unfortunately sometimes with internet you have to go with who provides the best bandwidth especially nowadays my advice would be if you have a choice of more than one company avoid virgin at all costs basically useless,Bad
976,ive had trouble with my handsets microphone doesnt work o have offered to exchange the phone of which i am happy with however getting them to send out the replacement is a whole different story times i have rang over days to get it sorted and still no phone there system says plenty of stock but i get emails with out of stock on really poor service and when i ask to speak to a manager their advisors get irate and basically say thats not to happen,Bad
977,shocking customer owe us some money after we close the account and its a nightmare to get it ignore the fact that it takes days to get it we are relocating abroad so have no uk address and they wont transfer the money to our bank account i was told by the billing department that virgin is an old school company hilarious considering that its very high tech and super easy to sign up anyway after proposing some potential solutions this guys answer was that they were actually making me a favour by paying to me what they owe me and that i should call back with an uk address as they wont make any wonder what would happen if i took the same approach when it comes to pay my bills so virgin media ill leave an envelope with my bills amount in my local virgin store as im unable to set up a direct debit or pay rude billing department who even shouted at me while i was not extremely friendly i wasnt again bye,Bad
978,rubbish customer services and service always down,Bad
979,the worst company going did even tell me that my item that i i toke out has failed no emails all i had was someone was get back to me in due course and this also a complaint as i do not believe nothing you have said to night no emails other then saying the order is parked in the order saying also someone well get back to me due course and all your team ate saying otherwise if i did get this send to me free of charge and no credit free tablet as an apology hello id th december theres only a few more checks between you and the good stuff youll find out soon if your orders confirmed when you get an email or call from us,Bad
980,very unhappy with virgin media especially the customer service or lack of it has taken almost months for them to correctly bill me they were constantly over charging me virgin wifi is awful it constantly drops out when im upstairs i have spoken to cs about this and after explaining ive moved the router to several different places they said the only option is to have their new boosters which i would have to pay extra i wouldnt recommend vm at all,Bad
981,crap had argue for months to not be charged for cancellation and a refund as ive had no service they only give a partial service and no manager call back when u say to staff u need to speak to a manager absolute,Bad
982,i cancelled my broadband contract as i moved into a new house in the last month instead of charging me the amount of the days that i was with them they decided to charge me for a whole month i ended up being in credit i called them twice to let them know that i do not live there anymore and to give them the new address both times i was reassured that they updated my called again after weeks and i was told that the check was issued and sent to the correct address i called weeks later and i was told that the check was sent to the wrong address they said they resent it weeks later i called again i was told that the check was sent again to the old address they resent it and reassured me i should get it in weeks weeks later i called again the first time i spoke to a guy who was mocking me and was full of irony i hang up frustrated and called again spoke to a lady that said that the only check she could see was issued in january and sent to the old address she reassured me again that she sent a new one to the correct address and i should have in weeks most i asked to speak to her supervisor to file a complaint for the guy i talked earlier but apparently she forgot about it and hang up today i called again guess what the only check she could see was issued in january and sent to the old address i asked to speak to a supervisor but i was refused to they asked for my number and said that the will call me they said that all the supervisor can do is exactly what she will reissue a new one and i should have it in weeks time i will wait for more weeks if i dont get the check by then im gonna follow the legal way thank you virgin media for this unforgettable treatment this is how you treat all your customers when they decide to to virgin you never read what i wrote thats the number that i called countless of times and never got me anywhere and the only thing you can suggest is me calling you back you can see my name you can see my email thats my account email you can use it to really help me instead of copy pasting useless automated replies,Bad
983,doesnt even deserve one star so i signed up for bt on the th of january didnt hear anything from bt after so i had to get back in touch and order again on the th of january my hub arrived pretty quickly to be fair but this was literally the only quick and efficient part opened the box and half of the connections were missing there was no adsl filter or grey connection cable so i waited for a couple of days and still herd nothing from bt so i made a call to find out when i would be connected they told me i would go live on the th of february this date came and went so i had to contact bt again they then said i would be live on the th of feb which was fine the th came and still no connection so of course i called bt again they told me they needed to get an engineer out and that one would come on the th yes you know whats coming next still no broadband or engineer i had to make yet another call to bt to then be told that an engineer would be out to get the connection up and running etc on the th of march and i would be live between the yet again still no connection so i had to make another phone call yet again today to my frustration i was told the same and that they would speak to the connections team so i was told she would one be a few short i was on hold for to then be cut off so yes at this point im done someone was good enough to call me back and apologise for the loss of connection and said they just needed to go through some security questions with me before he could look into it i stopped him at this point and told him to cancel my order he said again he was sorry on behalf of bt and will get this sorted rite away i said cancel my order and have gone with a different provider now sky promise i will be live on the th of march music to my ears my children mite finally be able to connect to the internet and do their schoolwork log onto google classroom and try and somewhat catch up with the work they have not been able to do thanks to bt i know i have gone on a little but i am so frustrated and angry with the customer service and the whole service of bt infact to keep getting told and promised that we would be connected after two months is a bloody joke and yes i know circumstances are difficult for us all at the moment because of so why keep moving the goalpost and postponing connection for me and lie everytime i called appalling i will never ever go with bt again after this experience i will avoid at all costs certainly will not be recommending bt to anyone ever also when you call customer services expect to be on the phone for atleast two hours you will spend around mins listening to music on hold while they go and make a cup of tea and eat cake to pop on the phone for about a min to tell you it will be connected at such and such a date then hang up and guess dont get connected very unhappy customer and angry,Bad
984,terrible service overall they seem to make it deliberately difficult to cancel amend or enquire about what your paying for i have been waiting for over almost hours to be in contact with the relevant team calls get cut off the chat service is almost mythological worst part is i have to keep trying otherwise the bill automatically renews and will hike up a month as they conveniently do every year have been advised to cancel the contract and reapply to get a better deal which is ridiculous and needless i cant even cancel the contract because nobody is there to do it,Bad
985,heres what ive gone through with virgin at the end of my tether and they make it almost impossible to complain see below for my email im trying to send virgin hi virgin team unfortunately this email is a complaint for the virgin mobile team ive been with virgin for over a year now for my home broadband phone and tivo box and ive been really happy to receive constant emails updates and notifications when deals come up i recently received a magazine in the post exclusive offer for anjali and ive been considering transferring over my contract for a while so it couldnt have come at a better time last thursday th december i finally called in and spoke with crystal in the sales tea she was extremely helpful and i ended up purchasing two phones from her one for myself and another for christmas she guaranteed delivery on saturday th december which i was completely shocked by and very happy with on saturday th december i was even more delighted to receive my delivery around am but when i opened it i only received one phone samsung s mini and my iphone c was missing i called in thinking they were coming separately but i found out for security reasons my iphone c was held back when i asked why they said they do random checks especially on iphones as they are expensive to make sure there isnt anything fraudulent going on i was told that i was called on my house number and left a message which was a lie as there wasnt a missed call or a message and i was also told that they text me on a number starting with which is ridiculous as both my husband and my mobile numbers start in i was put through to the security department not sure the exact name of that department and i spoke to a very rude man who said that virgin was doing me a favour by holding my phone and actually it was a benefit which wasnt helpful at this stage i had already cancelled my contract with orange and got my pak code so i was phone less and wasnt getting any alternatives or options given to me to get me a phone on saturday th december the gentleman went onto say that i can cancel it and sort it myself in a shop again very helpful he put me back through to the sales department to try and find an iphone c in a store near me i spoke to amy who said that virgin and carphone warehouse provide virgin contracts after being on the phone for hour minutes in total they put me through to the clapham junction carphone warehouse and spoke to a guy in store who said they only do virgin sim only but no contracts he was confused why i was put through and said amy didnt explain why i was being put through this i thought was absolutely shocking customer service i then had to call back and i asked to be put through to a manager or the complaints department to which i was cut off when they tried putting me through i called back again absolutely furious at this point asking again to be put through to someone who could actually help i was put through to julie smith who was in the customer relations department who was the only one who said sorry to me she then tracked down a phone got me in shopping centre which isnt exactly local but my husband was willing yo pick it up for me julie waived my delivery charge of and upfront fee of which i would like confirmation of but my husband still had to drive miles pay for parking and waste another hours of our day sorting out something which started off relatively straightforward julie was the only member in your team that i spoke to that seemed to care when i got upset sand couldnt speak as it all got too much at this point id wasted hours of my saturday one of the last saturdays before christmas might i add and my husband took the phone call to speak to julie as i had enough i found this service appealing overall and just shocking ive been a home broadband customer for over a year and not had to complain once i left orange as id had really bad service to join you and within two days experienced all this crystal didnt mention to me that you do random spot checks for security reasons if she had i couldve followed up on friday to make sure i had my phone delivered on time im really disappointed in all honesty and feel really let down by virgin following on from this i gave my pak code to the team on sunday th december and they said that my number wouldnt be transferred over on tuesday th december and received a confirmation text to say so tuesday th december came and surprise surprise my phone number from my old phone hadnt come over i called in and spoke to a gentleman who said by midnight it will be sorted its now wednesday th december and my phone number still hadnt transferred over ive just called in and spoke to mark from general billings department who said that i needed to call in and activate my phone which again was not relayed back to me mark was really helpful and apologised for the troubles id been through and ive just had my phone activated ive been in and out of hospital this week with an ongoing condition and not having a phone has been really difficult so this has been an extremely difficult time for this to all go so wrong i would like this email and complaint to be taken seriously and i would like someone to genuinely look into your lack of customer service i received i would like a response otherwise my next email will be cancelling both mobile contracts and my entire home services with you,Bad
986,phone took nearly weeks to arrive by which time my landline had already been disconnected i tried to chase this order up to get the phone before i was disconnected but bt shop cannot be contacted by phone bit ironic their online chat was unavailable and they did not respond to my contacted bt themselves who effectively told me their was no way of them chasing up an order from bt shop so i ended up ordering my phone from bt directly their phone arrived a fortnight before the phone from the bt shop just to add to the irony all of which is lost on bt i subsequently received flyers in the post from bt telling me to be prepared for the great digital switchover then an email telling me by bt bill was being increased to be honest hopeless doesnt begin to fully describe the experience still it could be worse i could be a pensioner with no internet connection or mobile or a lifeline pendant that is connected to their landline in which case the first time you would be aware that your phone has been disconnected would be when you are trying to use it in an emergency,Bad
987,been with them for years without issue now they cant get my data right i pay for a gb bolt on then it vanishes even though my mobile broadband device is off but of course i must have used it and not the first time this has happened no wonder they only get on trustpilot never ever use o,Bad

990,the customer service itself was relatively good but this is the third time in a row i have waited in queue for over two hours to still be in queue waiting the second time this happened there was only one person ahead of me in queue for context i gave up and went to another service provider based in bon accord and was seen basically immediately,Bad
991,product arrived late and then didnt actually work,Bad
992,having moved out of my flat last minute and having to have emergency surgery due to cancer my account was closed without permission and i was demanded to pay as a closing fee which i came home to following my hospital saying this was not due to me having to stay off work for two months with no income as im self employed apparently there was nothing they could doi would never use virgin again,Bad
993,if i could give a zero star i i sat in for four hours and no engineer turned up i gave bt benefit if the doubt after the first missed visit silly me and stupidly sat waiting again for four hours to guess no engineer again both booked days in advance so its not like there was time for them to be organised ive had an extremely stressful house move and all this on top of it my stress levels are through the roof when i rang on wednesday at to chase up the engineer who was to arrive between pm to be told they prob just late and wait a bit longer thankfully i didnt settle for that pushed for more info and they finally told me there was a system error and no one was coming poor service and had i been naive enough to listen id still be sitting waiting ive asked for everything to be cancelled ive refused the pitiful compensation offered but still to my fury received an email to say its being added to my july i was to receive a call from customer service re the first failed visit from th june call was to be between am they rang me at i couldnt take the call and agreed they ring me back between pm that surprise no call instead tried to ring me again the next morning im working so couldnt take the call today th july i get a message to say mini hun us being switched off so zero wifi baring in mind ive been relying on a rubbish mini hun to work from since th not had an tv service since th june and ive paid for my monthly bill in advance with zero services and no support not to mention raise stress levels impact to my wellbeing and juggling to find places with wifi to work from as i normally work from next step is complaints ombudsman and legal im completely disengaged with what i previously believed was a great brand,Bad

996,after hours on the phone to at least six different people in the philippines or somewhere i have got nowhere i am simply trying to change my contract from virgin to o but have found it completely impossible to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing one man actually admitted that the merger of virgin and o is causing problems after finally having been promised a contract at a specific price i was then told at the last moment that i couldnt have the price after all i have given up and will never have anything to do with this company again,Bad
997,worst customer service ever due to a promise of being called back and being on hold for mins and then get cut off this was all down to them miss selling me a contract on top of my contract so i was paying pound a month contracts they said they would credit my account pound and never did they lied to get out of it i have since left and gone elsewhere avoid ee like the plague,Bad
998,shocking experience from virgin media i have been a loyal customer with them for years i am currently paying pounds a month for a media package i then called to advise that i no longer would like the package and just need to have the broadband the customer service rep christine advised she was able to offer at a rate of on a year deal which i accepted she then passed me on to her colleague who then advised she was not able to offer this deal and that virgin media would want pcm i have had no choice but to give my days notice to virgin despite being an excellent customer for years,Bad

1006,if i could give less than star i would today i went to pick up my new phone from o store in bath which was ordered online when i arrived the shop was packed with nobody at the main payment desk there were only a couple of staff serving at the info desks and the computer system seemed to be down after waiting some time i asked one of the bearded assistants at the desk next to me if somebody could help me as i had just come to pick up my order he had great pleasure in saying out loud you will have to wait your turn in front of the whole shop surely anybody with more than one brain cell would try and serve the customers they could why they were having computer issues even when i said i would have to cancel my order he said i was more than welcome to go ahead i left the shop and came back a few hours later when it was less busy where a young lad behind the cash desk was more helpful and i was able to pick my package up in a few moments o up your game your customers make your big profits dont offer an easy shop pick up which isnt easy i have always been happy with the service o have offered in the past but i feel today the service standard was poor and certain members of your staff rude,Bad
1007,complained about multiple broadband failures affecting my working from home also getting scam calls on an apparently new number with scammed claiming to be virgin media luckily i looked up the app they asked me to download their service i feel is leaving me open to scamming and failure to be steady on broadband affecting my work and they do what i feel is nothing to help,Bad
1008,they use kelly communications they are rude and obnoxious they will park in a resident only parking and park across cars owned by disabled people blocking them in when asked to move their vans they just laugh at you and then when you complain to their head office you just get off its as if they get complaints all the time i had to complain twice to get an answer,Bad
1009,the customer service received today was awful it has taken one hour to simply cancel an account i was passed between three departments before anyone could help the website is not very helpful either this is one of the reasons i have chosen to procure services from another provider overall very disappointing,Bad

1011,disgusted with virgin media i had to move house and found out they didnt service my new property so to say thanks for being a loyal customer they charged me over in exit fees yay i get that someone could lie about moving house to break the contract but if you can prove youve moved and they know they dont supply the new property why would they penalise that seems short sighted to me as ill never go near them again,Bad

1016,bt are a disgrace and a trust pilot score of out of says it all the lowest score ive seen online for any company ever shocking customer services terrible broadband performance and failed promises it took three weeks to finally get through to their telephone customer services sometimes on hold for over half an hour to talk to somebody to be told initially i should have called within two weeks to cancel joke then after minutes of arguing finally they agree to waive the ridiculous annual charge for weeks terrible service and to top it off i get home from holiday yesterday to find a letter demanding the even though they agreed on the phone on th july that the yearly sub fee would be waived and that i would receive a bill only for the small amount of data used fail fail fail if i could have given or out of i would have disgraceful,Bad
1017,the chat connection is parson i was connected to didnt understand a simple line of questions which the talk talk website didnt contract end shortly and i simply want to the best package for the newt year or cant,Bad
1018,horrendous network terrible customer servicei was assured due to service outage in december that my full bill would be covered lo and behold end of december a bill for over is generated the advisor i spoke to hadnt actioned this i spoke to someone else who said i may have misheard the advisor i asked them to listen to the calls they did and i was right they agreed to cover the bill but couldnt cancel or amend the dd with over a weeks notice so said a refund would be issued i was already annoyed by this but agreed i was then told the refund would take days days came around no refund rang up to be told the refund was requested incorrectly and wouldnt be processed for another working a multi billion pound company you should be investing in training your incompetent staff and ensuring you have a system that allows you to refund within working day we all know you have this capacity but you just decide to mess your customers have been a customer for years and i feel ridiculously let down especially in times when every penny counts,Bad
1019,i posted an earlier comment about informing me that within a month of renewing my contract with them they are increasing the cost of my landline calls i had understood that the fees would be fixed for months the length of my contract indeed on my latest bill is includes a discount on unlimited uk calls boost for months saving you this discount ends on may i took the advice of the talktalk rep who responded to my comment and contacted talktalk what i now understand is that they have increased the basic fee for my landline while not touching the calls boost discount i understand they can do this with any of their fees and only need give days notice so the good deal i initially thought i had could end up being a very bad deal if there are further increases over the next have contacted martin lewis at but really i wish id never heard of talktalk my advice is read the small print very very carefully and ask about potential fee increases before you sign up,Bad
1020,transferring my virgin mobile phone account across to o was a fiasco only made worse by o having reused the mobile sim number before and i obviously was not that person or had their password or could answer their security questions i hope never to speak to o ever again,Bad
1021,wouldnt even give them a one star they over charge there broadband and because you chose to switch to a different broadband the lovely woman over customer services hangs up on me childish and unprofessional maybe focus on better customer service and stop harassing people every day into buying broadband that doesnt even work half the time absolute waste of a few years wont be back,Bad
1022,account was cut off due to a problem processing payment no internet and unable to work phoned to pay my bill and couldnt get my password to work so had a new password posted the man on the phone was rude and after asking the security questions date of birth bill amount and bank sort code was told the code was wrong and he could not access my account turns out he had put my account code in wrong and now it was my fault and i had to either pay in full but he could not tell me the amount or call back in half an hour because of his mistake this i had to do because i couldnt work without the internet on calling back got the same man payed what we owed and was then probed as to when i would be paying the next month even though it wasnt due he again was rude and i asked to be transfered to disconnections we have never had a landline and very really watch the tv all we need is internet however i was this would cost just as much as im paying now and even if we wanted to leave we cant until feburary so basically was told tuff the only channel we do watch is fox which will soon be unavailable on virgin and on calling a number times for the internet not working we get told it looks good from your end so nothing you can do i will be cancelling our contract when possible,Bad
1023,before buying from o please check the one star rating for virgin are now all part of the same business group same theme poor customer service and over shall be cancelling virgin media mobile using o avoid,Bad
1024,totally ignored the questions i had about my contract and just tried to sell an upgrade that was more expensive than the offer i explained to them was behind the reason for leaving,Bad
1025,waste of time i have a constant problem with bb line and they cant fix it every time it fails i have to go through the same process which is a complete waste of my time the last on line call just asked me to call back because they could not resolve the issue again,Bad
1026,unfortunately you cant give zero stores ive been between jobs for a while but the bill has always been paid i contacted them to say id found a new job working from home and wouldnt be able to pay until the th they told me therefore id be disconnected im working from home so now ive lost my job thanks virgin you knew that would be the outcome so now i cant pay at all as i dont have a job to do so,Bad
1027,i wish i was writing something positive sadly one of the worst customer service i have experienced huge communication issue across different teams i am always getting different answers when asking questions to the support team about extra charges agents are simply unable to assist,Bad
1028,if only i could give no can u promise me something that will get resolved in days all of a sudden increase to two weeks,Bad
1029,dreadful experience digital voice phone not worked since being installed spent hours on the phone with various custom service people no one could fix it they didnt ring back when they said they would waited in for there calls which didnt happen weeks later still not working so have left to go to sky very very unhelpful they dont seem to care,Bad
1030,is sleeping tight i have been using for three years recently i could not able to make any call or sms i just wanted to keep my number and switch to another network everytime whenever i had tried to get pac code by sending sms to they replied sorry its technical fault even i did try to call them via and there was no response everytime the call was on waiting guess what email is also have failed to contact if there is no customer service available u better shut the company i dont know how to get pac code now,Bad
1031,o are particularly bad at keeping you updated on better plans i had a pay as you go data and calls plan and have been able to switch to ee and get times as much data for the same price and equivalent calls etc,Bad
1032,very poor customer service broadband has been out since tech support are useless th breakdown since the start of the contract when you try co cancel the contract because of the poor service you have a breakage fee to pay terrible service do not use,Bad
1033,be careful with ee when the say they will do a general credit check to see if you are ok to offer a month sim deal at the start of your contract they dont mention they will report all your monthly payments to all credit agencies meaning if you ever have a dispute or refuse to pay a wrong amount due to an error by them after changing your contract or any other reason that can arise as many disputes do with these companies who are far from perfect they will damage your credit status and correcting this can take months to resolve but they will during this time report it as a default which affects your ability to get loans or credit which can be a very serious thing which impacts your life the complaints structure is all headed and run by the usual institutional bias structure of executives who all support their colleagues as they get preferential treatment and are looked after to tow the line and who are further protected by their regulator who is always bias towards them you dont know the half of it hence why we have so many problems of bad service and complaints in the uk despite being so financially advanced and old they are never apologetic or look into whether they have done things properly or fairly so long as they feel they have an untested procedure which hasnt been properly challenged in the courts which might get them off even though common sense tells you its not fair or right terrible customer to customer treatment and service and they cant even tell almost funny the sales and technical staff are nice and were very pleasant the complaints and executive staff an utter nightmare who were playing the victim even though i was the one who had been affected they love to close off complaints even before a customer agrees to and make you incur more time to reopen and repeat things in order to frustrate you a common tacit only the scrupulous sorts engage in i never realised the corruption and institutional bias was so bad truly shocking its no surprise service standards are so bad and why so many people are unhappy and stressed and other things going downhill instead of up in the uk are falling apart and they cant even tell and are in such denial its a shame so many dont know what it is to truly cause a change for the better rough review draft will fix up later i will recommend a good alternative to ee shortly if one exists as all appear to be controlled by the same circle of shareholders hmm interesting its like a,Bad
1034,their website is pretty buggy one of the worst ive seen for such an established order at all for days oops there was a problem processing your order repeatedly until one day it we were charged times the amount of our order not separate charges just overcharged called support line and theres no option for customer who have been able to buy but have no phone number item not delivered so dont know number so went through as a new number also wasnt allowed to change delivery address despite email from ee saying this direct quote delivering to a different address its up to you where we send your new device well deliver to your home or another address easiest for takes over mins every time to get through the online chat is a massive wait too all agents are currently assisting others your estimated wait time is minutes and seconds thank you for your code site doesnt work error with captcha on website is full of embarrassing bugs that need addressed urgently,Bad
1035,star is too much it took weeks for broadband to be set up i did not see when signing up there was a maximum upload speed which is as i had only saw the minimum download speed guaranteed we cannot connect to our hive thermostat because it needs a minimum upload speed of when i had initially contacted talk talk i was promised that this would be fixed no changes so i contacted for the rd time and was told that there is nothing wrong with our internet speed and we should upgrade anyways i saw online that fibre was now available in our area month after signing up i contacted the upgrade team who said that its not possible for me to switch they are basically only signing up new customers,Bad
1036,when i agreed my month contract in october talktalk stated the new price you sign up to will be the price you pay for your entire contract meaning you wont have to worry about any mid contract price rises i also received a whole lot of documentation stating that my price was fixed why then am i receiving a message four months later stating that my bill is going up by per month an increase apparently its because people are using the internet more and they need to invest in their infrastructure what a load of bs quite how this breach of contract is legal i do not know according to their email i can cancel without penalty but a call to their customer service confirms that is also a lie i can cancel for free but i must pay the rest of my contract off almost not exactly free then what a disgusting scam,Bad
1037,been online for hour and then they just ended the chat without notice i have never repeated myself so much and still did not get a satisfactory answer having been with talktalk for many years they obviously dont want my custom anymore so i will need to look elsewhere they wanted to put up my monthly charge by almost which i believe is totally unacceptable,Bad
1038,probably the worst customer service i have yet to encounter,Bad
1039,i was given some channels for free when i renewed my contract last year after calling and texting a few times i gave up as i didnt have the time everytime i cant wait for my contract to finish to switch company,Bad
1040,how is this company allowed to function as they do i will be switching companies as soon as i can i have never felt so distressed dealing with a company that is supposed to be providing a service multiple calls not returned complaints ignored refunds that were supposed to be given not given if this was a small company they would be shut down,Bad
1041,do not get virgin media for years ive had issues and for years they told me theres issues in the area eventually they had a national breakdown some time last year and then it got way worse after that we called them multiple times and eventually a technician was called out he identified the issue with my area and said virgin media finally acknowledged the issue and finally started working on it mid he also said there was an issue with the wiring connecting our house to their network which needed replacement that was summer its now almost february and they havent replaced it i called them multiple times since and heres how some of them of them told me theres no issue with our wiring and all we needed to do is press and hold the reset button on the back and the issue was fixed for good no more issues i did this every night for a month and there was no then told me theres never been any issues in my area even though id been told otherwise for was telling me he understands my frustration and we were about to sort the issues out and we mysteriously got disconnected no call back horrible customer service horrible service horrible prices and they had the audacity to send us a letter saying they wont be raising prices this year because they understand that everyone is struggling with the situation virgin media is a scam they may have been good at one time but i will never be able to recommend them to anyone and i cant wait till moves into my area,Bad
1042,forced to sign into another month contract with bt shortly before we moved which was an annoyance but ok because we were insured that wed be able to easily move the account to our new easy isnt exactly the word id use to describe the experience so far as the experience is no where near booked for bt to come around and install at the new address weeks in advance they could give us a day but not a time meaning my husband had to book at day off work again annoying but at least it was getting the day no one turned up after an hour on hold to bt it turned out our booking was lost we were offered a new appointment but with a week wait and no effort to find anything sooner again no time slot so wed have to use another days holiday which are quickly running out so now weve lost our tv internet phone line for weeks which we are still expected to pay for ive had to pay for extra data on my bt mobile at a go to try sort things out and most annoying of all weve lost days holiday which we cant get back and the problem still isnt the internal complaints procedure is a joke you sit on hold for an hour to be told you cant raise a formal complaint until hours after your avoid like the plague,Bad
1043,extremely rude staff got cut off first time nd time got back to same agent who promised a call back because she was having technical issues did not receive any call back called back myself to realise that there was no notes left on the system this agent i next spoke to was extremely rude expecting me to know about how a wifi booster and wifi should be made up became increasingly annoyed raised her voice and said oh my god disgraceful behaviour i requested to speak to a manager and log a complaint i couldnt do this because no managers available and complaint would apparently take days for a call back in the end had to continue speaking to this rude lady who eventually booked a engineer to visit my house but awful experience wifi constantly unstable having issues working from home and call centre agent dont have a clue on how uk homes are made up poor quality in training without a doubt thumbs down,Bad
1044,would give zero stars if the system allowed advised them i was moving their service does not cover my new address was told to call back days before moving to terminate during this time my broadband went down was told an engineer would have to attend but no availability for weeks i asked for a refund as i could not use the internet but they offered compensation which went into my online account which i was told i needed to access to transfer to my bank account when i advised them again that i was moving was told i had to give days notice not i disputed this and a day notice period was attempting to access my online account to recover the compensation my account had been suspended on the same day i received a letter stating my service would terminate on st them and spent minutes on the phone only to be cut off phoned back cut off again during the first call i was told that money had been taken out of the compensation no doubt to cover the current monthly payment eventhough i have no i believe my broadband was cut off as i declined the offer of their upgrade to full fibre broadband and my account has been suspended so i am unable to access the compensation my service remains live i have spent hours attempting to resolve these issues my advice dont touch them with a barge pole once theyve got you they wont let you go customer service abysmal,Bad
1045,new customer moved from ee broadband to bt via ee claiming bt can offer us faster broadband joined st october weeks later and failed open reach dates to connect us to broadband where they havent turned up we still dont have wifi shocking customer service as a new customer will be leaving and going with virgin,Bad
1046,three complaint for not turning up no house move when requested and was promised a phone call nothing bloody useless worst company i have ever used,Bad
1047,ee are thieves if i was you i wouldnt join them they can never stick to their words and they are always reasons to charge you extra terrible service they have workers that dont know how to do things properly they need proper training i would strongly advise avoid joining up with ee at any cost,Bad
1048,i cannot recommend talktalk when i had to order the broadband over phone the call had a duration of more than hours so you can say the service is very slow it doesnt help that the employees cant speak nor understand english and therefore i had to spell out every single word even then the employee didnt spell my name correctly and even after all that they didnt get the information right and we now have to go through a very long process of correcting this moreover we havent recieved our router and they dont seem to want to help out with that and so i cant say anything about the wifi connection because they wont give us wifi in the first place,Bad
1049,pretty poor product even worse customer service ive arranged to have my contract at and not a single month have i been charged this due to the incompetence of the first agent who set up my contract ive had to contact you every month since july i have never paid the correct amount and have often been told ive underpaid ive come to hear to warn others as i cant get sorted any other way,Bad
1050,heya leonard really sorry it took so long but really glad we could get there in the end social team,Bad
1051,tried to sort out my credit card hopeless and their new system is a joke they owe me a refund but impossible to get in their new system is clearly designed to keep the money or so difficult to so that customers owed money give up a once great bank now grubby,Bad
1052,i did not have an internet for a month and i called x times virgin to solve my problem nothing happened i wrote a lot of comment to the community site nothing happened i changed my package to the biggest one and i have a internet they does not care anything except the money ridiculous,Bad
1053,had from of my top ups back havent touched the phone was about to credit and yous the to get my monthly pay as you go allowance just took for no reason apparent to me im a bit fed up of these companies that are just doing what they like,Bad
1054,false advertising with what internet they will provide customer service is bottom of the barrel as well i am even on laggy non responsive internet writing this would give minus stars if i could,Bad
1055,never have i ever been so compelled to leave a negative review till today the customer service team has time and time again demonstrated its incompetence with each subsequent advice invalidating the previous one each time ill get served with the something along the lines of sorry for what you had been told but in fact it is my experiences called up to cancel disconnection and was confirmed that i would be restated to the same terms per my existing contract ie month notice instead of a fresh month minimum contract surprised to find out that the charges were increased slightly in my subsequent bill and was registered as a new contract called up to inform disconnection a month in advance and was advised the kit to return the modem would be sent and received within weeks followed up weeks later as no return kit was received advised that a new kit would be with me within working days ultimately received no return kit and was advised that the kit would only be sent post disconnection date,Bad
1056,still not dealt with my elderly mothers phone line the engineer blames the phone even though my mother has purchased sets of new phones so i have contacted and also contacted the bbc news who are arranging an interview with my mother and disabled sister to show the world how virgin has left them not be able to phone or receive calls from the outside world and charging them a month for the privilege,Bad
1057,my wife and i had to call four times to cancel our pay monthly sim cards which we ordered but didnt use and it was well within days each time we called they said they would cancel but we kept getting charged the people we spoke to were rude and frankly miserable the customer service is the worst ive ever experienced and i thought virgin was bad stay away from o the freebies arent the hassle,Bad
1058,shame on you in the netherlands all the subscribers lost their network on friday around no any company announcements have been done until monday they did not reply to any enquires the support line was inaccessible on monday they come up with options like choose auto roaming and switch the phone for at least min a lot of users here were complaining about monday evening they were claiming that the services are restored and if there are still dead phones they have to have their replaced when the new ordered sim will arrive and will it work or not noone knows the peoples are angry because they had to arrange somehow to be reachable is it a temporary issue or not noone knows we cannot rely on this companys can happen to any company to have failures but being honest and not lying to your customers is mandatory in this case also to provide compensations,Bad
1059,having recently moved and informing well in advance of the cancellation of my broadband i thought everything was ok not so the past weeks have been incredibly frustrating emails asking me to reinstate my direct debit so i could continue to receive virgin tv never had it bills for outstanding amount when in actual fact i was in credit maddening phone calls to customer service overseas naturally who couldnt understand what i was talking about half the time i couldnt understand them either one agreed they owed me money which i would receive after days another telling me id been paid and owed i live in the uk i finally spoke to someone in the uk ive been assured my account is clear,Bad
1060,i dont think ive ever had a positive customer experience with vodafone just dreadful will be leaving for sky mobile shortly not only do they provide better sim only deals but you can actually speak to a human being within a reasonable amount of time,Bad
1061,ee have become so expensive of deals now are above a month its a joke a year for a phone haha not sure why people need the status of having a flagship device i switched to smarty for a month with gb data g unlimited calls texts its been amazing for me will not be going back to them now im saving a year people should wise up,Bad
1062,had limited access for two lied to me for the months then because they couldnt fix the problem they blamed me for the problem even though it was their also then put me on an automated block call so every time i phoned up using my landline number it would say your problem has been fixed there is no problem with our end and the call would voided their own contract so i opt out after months but its days to then be lied too begged and even threatened about being hit with bad credit if i leave which i did since then bt have charged me more passed my bills which have added up since i have not been with them to multiple debt collection when they are in the me on multiple occasions and even getting scam texts and calls from people claiming to be bt on a regular basis quoting my old details they then without telling me slipped x reward cards instead of destroying the contract without mentioning about the reward cards and kept my bill rolling i made it clear over times that they voided the contract and i want out but clearly bt are not the best in their game m customers they cannot please all i understand that but when they mug a loyal customer that is a joke,Bad
1063,you people have the worst customer service ever when i ordered my oomph i was promised a voucher after speaking to customer service times about it they said i will get it in days its been months now and i still havent recieved it stop false advertisment,Bad
1064,harassment a year ago i received a letter saying that prices would go up but as a result i could cancel in x days and avoid fees for whatever reason i couldnt and still cant log into my account even using the reset comes up with no account on record so the only way to contact virgin media was through a online chat no emails available and using a phone asked me for account details which didnt work i used this chat twice both times i told the staff about the letter and said that i would like to cancel my contract as my right according to the letter they asked for types of identification which i provided both times which matched with my account bank details when the contract was created and when the payment goes out etc as well as my name email and address neither time did the staff cancel my contract in fact on the nd attempt i got a email from them saying that someone is impersonating my account it is a joke anyway now i am being harassed by a dept collector who is saying that virgin media did not receive any order to cancel my account can you imagine my rage for this company account number area reference i would appreciate it if you stop harassing me already,Bad
1065,worst experience of all the mobile providers i have bought a monthly plan via after the first month ive got a message that my plan has failed to renew due to payment error i have contacted customer service numerous times via phone email and chat the answer was always the same we are not able to bring back your previous deal or offer a similar one you have to purchase one of our standard plans from the offer for existing customers which is much worse than the one i have signed up for and switched from previous provider very dissapointed,Bad
1066,this is the worst worst internet provider charged me because i took days extra to pay bill that too in dont even feel like giving them star unfortunately i have to,Bad
1067,shocking customer service worked for a week then nothing engineer visits a week later zero broadband then it took them days to rather not have internet that pay this shower of st company diabolical avoid at all a breach of contract so i never need to use or speak to them again,Bad
1068,i cant believe that an organisation like bt could be so utterly incompetent so many times for so long only a utter fool would chose to have bt as a supplier of any service i strongly recommend you choose another supplier just for your sanity so why well in july last year after my bt contract came to an end i was quoted a increase in my broadband so i chose to leave and went with sky which was cheaper than the pre increase price of bt on the th of august my switch was completed i left a week later for my holidays and did not return until october i then left on holiday again and did not return until december i checked my bank in late december realised that bt had still charged me until november i contacted sky first to find out when the switch took place then contacted bt it took hours they could not understand how i could have been charged by them because the switch had been done but eventually they agreed that they had made a mistake and would refund me instead of raising a payment to me they charged me the raising a bill for it now owing me so they raised a credit for this meant they still owed me could i make them understand no so they eventually agreed i was right and would repay me it would be paid on the th january but take a few days before it came into my bank it arrived on the th january the same day in the post i received the bill aforementioned on the th of january despite my account being closed they took the bill payment of come on just how incompetent can a company get i have just spent another hours being passed from one department to another and had to argue with the department about the facts they could not understand the issue because they paid me on the th of january they did not they demanded i prove it by forwarding my bank statement i said check your own bank they said they cant do that in the end i took a photo of my online banking transactions to prove payments made and taken at pm days after starting the query and some hours on the telephone i am now told yet again it was an error and my payment of will show in days and they are so am i i will be cancelling my bt account for my business by ee mobiles and i will be encouraging anyone with sense to avoid bt at any cost this is the most incompetent organisation i have ever had the displeasure to have dealings with,Bad
1069,shame i cant give stars managed to finally cancel and disconnected nd week in august but yet they billed me over customer service called before disconnection date and explained why i had cancelled the customer service agent just started laughing which is just rude and disgusting behaviour please avoid at all costs they really do not care about customers and are only interested in charging extortionate price for shoddy service senior management dont care as long as they get their bonus people should look at these trust pilot reviews for vm before signing with them,Bad
1070,incapable company and incompetent customer service they wont even let me cancel my contract and give me my pac codes for my accounts i just get put on hold and transferred to someone else to start again then they say theyll put me on hold again but hang up on me coverage is terrible too unhelpful to say the least so far nearly hours wasted on multiple phone calls but they dont want me to cancel my multiple contracts which i was entitled to leave months ago on one account and over a year ago on the other im basically being held hostage and theres nothing i can do about it,Bad
1071,just had vm for days bt couldnt give me the guaranteed speed broadband is fine landline not working takes an age to talk to someone then they expect you to check their installation refuse to book an engineer until you do furious they dont give a bt customer service so much better sorry i had to switch,Bad
1072,after working for a franchise store for over the span of years i can clearly say without a doubt it was the worst experience in a job ive had period more to the point the franchise i worked for is run but what seems to be a band of untrained crooks who miss sell miss inform and cheat their employees daily i saw a turnover of around staff in a store fit for employees total of which every single one including myself was crippled by the franchise upon leaving not recieving promised bonuses unfair dismissal or forced into a sector they would have to was like o did not care how the franchise was run and the management at the time and currently present have no care for the company just you want to take a phone contract with o i plead that you avoid this franchise and find a retail based store or order directly push smb based contracts to non business customers just to hit targets give an abundance of false information or leave out key points purposely to screw you over in these franchise based job is for the dog eat dog anyone with a sense of kindness will lose this entirely upon staying in this franchise for more than months heartless rude idiotic and unprofessional to a was not even sales based and was forced to uphold sales and manage a store i was not even being paid to i gained promotions with no pay the hell even is that more duties for the same hope your company highlights this complaint to the addressed franchise which i know will not happen at all,Bad
1073,absolute of a customer been hung up on multiple times and told conflicting information multiple times incredibly unhelpful and clueless,Bad
1074,you just dont treat very longstanding customers the same as potential new been with you since i find that the price you are charging me to be excessive and it comes to something when your high street advisers suggest cancelling the contract and then taking out a fresh one to get a lower price,Bad
1075,difficult to get through to a human being and then in india or somewhere making it less easy,Bad
1076,despite having a wifi calling capable phone that works with several other providers the asda sim fails to provide wifi contacted customer service twice and i have still not had any to their blurb you only need a capable phone and wifi calling is automatic i think they are missing out some important need wifi calling as the mobile signal here varies between poor and non existent i think i may have managed to make one call in the month since i got the some success they did get back to me but thats as far as it goes apparently just because they say in their promotional guff that wifi calling is available provided your phone is capable of wifi calling that is not quite true the network will only allow certain phones to connect to wifi calling and asda can do squat about iti have been offered an asda gift card as a refund apart from the p phone call i managed to make during the month i had it and that will be a mile trip to spend it so asda stop selling falsehoods you are aware of the problem and you should make it clear that only certain phones will work regardless of their compatibility a link to list of compatible phones that you used to check my phone may be a good place to youre looking for wifi calling dont rely on asda to supply it,Bad
1077,i find out how to get talktalk emails onto my outlook i got no straight answers it should be easy i know im not the first person to ask this its all over google lots of and stuff but nothing works simple instructions on setting up talktalk on outlook it has someting to do with you not using your old domain to access my account i need my hotmail email so do i need this to use outlook to get talktalk emails,Bad
1078,i was pretty happy with the service while using the phone good quality however i had to talk to customer service on more than one occasions and they must use overseas customer service rep it takes minutes to answer first of all then they dont have authority to anything just points me to go to website and do everything anyways recently i just realized that i was set up on auto pay i used the service for months every month i paid directly through their website on a month to month basis i stopped using the service in april th and i assumed i wont recharge the sim because i dont need to use it anymore i log in to my bank account and take a look at my credit card statement and notice a mobile charge so i looked to see if i was charge last month and sure i was today is june th i have charges for last three months and i havent even used the sim card i called their customer service and after minutes of wait i had to hear that i set up auto pay i pleaded that i didnt but the rep said they dont have access to do anything but i signed up for auto pay so i said i get all the emails everytime i refill shouldnt i get a notification when i was set up on she said you got emails i am like i use gmail and i never delete emails of course she said i signed up for auto pay and she doesnt have access to change that so i had her delete the account but somehow she had access to delete the account well they made from me i will survive but its the aggravation and not willing to listen to customers is what bothers me i was actually happy with their phone service but because of bad process they lost one more customer but im sure they will replace me with others this is the reality of things and eventually it will catch up and management will wonder where did they go wrong if you do sign up with try not to use your credit card if you pay cash you will be okay i think just beware of the auto pay scheme they are running,Bad
1079,we have been without tv or internet for days a engineer is coming out tomorrow we have had a few problems over the years with virgin and thinking of leaving,Bad
1080,i have been with vodafone for many years and i have just wasted my time with advisors on the phone and online i told my son to go with payg with vodafone from three as up till now ive been satisfied he phoned to tell me had money taken out of his he put on to renew his phoned and they told him its because hed used picture messaging and because he didnt realise its charged they put back on for told me to look at mine and the only time i had ever sent one was back to my son and it had been taken out of my ready for my next bundle i was now short of the advisors said the system doesnt allow them to put money on very strange as they did for my soni asked if i could pay tge pence to bring it back up to the and im told im unable to so now i have p which i cant use as my rollover from month to month has mounted up with my data so a bundle has no benefit to me i was even offered to get a iou with a charge of made no sense at company that i pay bills to has a system that allows you on odd cannot a big company like vodafone do thisi feel undervalued as a customer for the sake of asked for a pac code number,Bad
1081,the problems i have had with this company would take far too long to explain but please take my advice and use a different supplier customer service is and very ever get a good word from me should be put out of business,Bad
1082,useless service no one cares about the costumer all calls take hr or more to be able to speak with agent,Bad
1083,times i have called to cancel my service times ive waited over minutes then to get through and only to be passed on then cut off absolute joke customer service is no existent its a shame really cos the actual internet service and signal is great pity the i cant say the same for customer service,Bad
1084,vodafone are a very bad company they make it very difficult for you to cancel your account i had to call them times in hours to cancel the first time they hung up on me the second they said they would text me the pac code they didnt the third i finally to cancel after listening yet again to some salesperson try to get me to stay they are very rude they just talk over you and try to persuade you to stay with them i am really glad i am no longer with vodafone,Bad
1085,very poor service in fact no service really got locked out of my account for mins although only made error on my login when i called i was left on hold for minutes and i gave up in the end no email contact to make an enquiry tried to make a telephone appointment as offered on the website and on my login was only provided with location of local stores hopeless overall i want to change to sim only so will look at alternatives such as gif gaf which my friend has recommended,Bad
1086,worst company in the would rather watch new top gear on repeat than speak to these people me for services i do not have hung up on repeatedly lied too laughed at miss sold services i didnt want or ask for and cut off when my bill was paid clear of these muppets,Bad
1087,i signed up to fibre with talk talk but no engineer appeared on scheduled day spent an hour on the phone to them no record general advice then fibre service then asked to go to sales gave up at this deal and speed looks good and i like the idea of not paying for landline so will give one further attempt but initial experience was poor and there seemed no initiative to engage potential new customer,Bad
1088,absolutely appalling called bt to tell them i was moving home and they told me an engineer would be out to my property which they never showed up so i called up to see what was going on an they told me an engineer doesnt need to be out when i had wires missing and i also dont know how set it all up i explained this to bt for days on the run and they sent me the same wire for days i really dont know how hard it is to send an engineer out to help a customer out then got put onto the manager an she told me she would help me over the phone when ive told them times i need an engineer out absolutely f useless,Bad
1089,this is my honest opinion after years with them the quality of the fibre network is good but other companies do offer alot better these days for much less i feel like vm is very disconnected from what is happening around them bt city fibre vodafone etc have all caught up and gone beyond what vm can offer now and have done for awhile i believe its this arrogance of believing they are still the best will inevitably be their downfall as others have mentioned the cs team just dont care they are trained to push packages onto you no matter the cost even if you explain you dont need it excuse after excuse for no discounts other than on tv packages bundled with fibre lines not to mention the recent price hikes which you have to battle to get any amount off its a constant cat and mouse tactic with them you have to play the game to get the discount it really is bad today i finally took the leap and left vm years and the constant back and forth is enough asking again and again to put me on something cheaper only to be told it would be more expensive go figure spoke to bt mins on the phone no pushing or being aggressive simply told them what i needed and that was it how cs should be i truly believe this arrogant behaviour will be vms downfall ps there is a dedicated forum and discord channel committed to how bad vm is and how to play the cat and mouse game thats how bad they are,Bad
1090,my wife and i are currently abroad and neither of our bt mobile phones work having spent over half an hour on the phone to bt yesterday i was assured that i would be able to make calls almost immediately one day later still useless the bt website tells me to phone them if i have a problem obviously i cant absolutely exasperating all round,Bad

1102,this has to be the company with the worst customer service of all time the various methods of contact are tucked away on the website in such a manner as to discourage doing such a thing in trying to chase the of as set out on their website and as promised at the time of total loss of phone you are pushed form pillar to post trying to speak to a manager is like trying to land on the moon but more you eventually get to that stage they cannot deal with it and have to transfer you to yet another manager i was cut off during this process twice despite the fact they have your phone number do they immediately phone you back no they do to live chat the process is long winded and tedious typing away and waiting for a be fair they did ring today but i was out and left a message asking me to contact them by ringing back on the main contact number which requires starting over no personal number to phone that particular person facebook contact is basically the same as live chat they cant actually do anything other than tell you to phone that same number but they were able to tell me a callback is booked for st of course i have not been told about this so i may well have been out had i not raised the matter with fbi eventually came across their complaints email address sent that and got the usual minimal acknowledgement but with a case number that was days ago still waiting for a reply despite saying they aim for the various calls and chats i was given three different estimates of the compensation due varying from to no flexibility no initiative and a total lack of customer care,Bad

1116,i bought a goody bag with always on data which to me sounded the same idea as all you can eat data after a week of using it regularly i get a text telling me i have reached my limit on data and will be downgraded to a much slower speed i then double check the website to find that always on data is really just gb of data and then after that you get painfully slow speed to the point of this information is de facto hidden on a second page and isnt clearly stated on the main order page whilst i cant claim its fully a scam because it does specify deeper in the site the limits and the name says always on data which is also theoretically true i feel its deliberately engineered to be misleading now whilst thats legally fine to do it just pisses off customers especially when its clear theres sleight of hand here i will be returning back to three i have been with them almost ten years and never had a problem with their unlimited data offering which even at the higher speed is much faster than i foolishly was wooed by the promise of a cheaper unlimited data package calls and texts are moot to me avoid,Bad
1117,nothing but problems since they switched to vodafone first two months it was impossible to top up or buy a bundle online in feb i had unexplained data charges which swallowed my entire balance despite having two data bundles with data left in them was promised a refund several times but havent received anything so far i still receive weird data warnings hadnt dared to top up again since feb and now that i did my card was charged but my account not credited hotline staff is friendly but useless it also appears they work from home using their own equipment which means it is often impossible to hear them due to a terrible setup data speed and reliability also has suffered since the switch stay away,Bad
1118,hi there i have provide the pac code to transfer my old mobile number to on and the app show it will complete to transfer on however today is but my old number still not transfer to this sim card disappointed,Bad

1120,what customer service impossible wait times when calling the fact that they dont supply an email address in their contact details and as a last resort no one bothering to respond on twitter yet it doesnt prevent them increasing our charge time after time what a sorry state of affairs,Bad
1121,i wanted to pay off the balance on my handset it took me forty minutes on the phone to the virgin indian call centre to do so and i spoke to separate people the line was very bad and i had to call twice as i could not the first person that i spoke to despite me having notified virgin of my change of address they had still registered my previous address against the credit agreement this meant that my card payment would not go an update they have actually managed to take my payment for my surprise that they are quick to take money off a customer however i told the call centre times yesterday that i had changed my address yet the email and letter is still addressed to my old one this is in addition to my having previously notified them that i had moved beyond incompetence someone in the company needs to take responsibility for the shambles of a service provided by the couldnt customer care less department,Bad
1122,just avoid them the worst customer service and poor equipment very poor telephone menus that are purposely obtuse you get the sense virgin would rather you not be a customer,Bad
1123,absolutely awful company where do i start i should probably say first off hands up we missed a payment that ones obviously on us and totally our own fault and theres no denying that but we used the automated payment line and payed the outstanding bill on thursday the th of april almost a week later we still have no internet we have been reconnected twice for about hours at a time it then usually disconnects very conveniently around pm when the office shuts dont even bother ringing the so called out of office support line as all youll be assisted with is some unmotivated grumpy agent who has no ideas about anything who cant actually help at all all theyll do is create a ticket which will then get ignored and lost in the ether or potentially dealt with the following day if your lucky as i just said dont bother calling out of standard office hours of despite the website stating the phone lines are open until pm as youll get nowhere we have called at least times and spoken to agents during the day who to be fair are very friendly however were always dished the same oh were investigating well bloody hell its like an international investigation so far a week later and no answers or resolve we have had at least or online chats in an attempt to resolve this issue only to be constantly assured it wont happen again bla bla bla the most entertaining part of this saga however is how they keep shifting the blame to talktalk apparently talktalk are theyre provider and they have a glitch on their system which keeps reapplying service suspensions which roughly translates as the provider who we pay has zero control over our connectivity let alone any control over helping solve their customers issues so why are we paying a middle man to do absolutely nothing and by doing so breach their own contract mind boggling its peculiar in this day and age for a company to think its customers are so naive to actually tolerate this sort of service and accept being off and lied to on multiple occasions in hindsight which is always a wonderful thing i wouldnt touch home telecom with a ft barge pole if you enjoy being bounced pillar to post and getting nowhere with poor internet connection then this is the provider for you if you want actual connectivity and real customer service then im afraid your a long way from home avoid at all costs,Bad
1124,absolutely a total rip of customer services is total keep adding money to my bills ie secure net call division when dont have land line cheeky stay well clear,Bad
1125,good afternoon i received a letter from talktalk to say that i had been offered a new plan because my old plan had finished i was now on standard rate and this is no good i went on the web site but could not find a section to say change to new plan so i contacted a person that was on your web chat line said that she could not help and passed me to same line of questions no wonder people pull their hair out as i am still on standard charge i am looking for another supplier baz,Bad

1128,on the th june i received my welcome email and details of how best to make use of my data one month later and numerous calls i still do not have a sim card i have seen the first direct debit taken from my account and discussed with a customer service representative that despite me asking to make a complaint and to cancel the plan the response was simply we can offer you compensation requests to cancel seemed not to register as to the compensation i would have to ring them back when i received the sim given their failure to succeed in the last three attempts i dou t they will succeed a firth time to can in this age of mobile technology i have to print a form of post it into them and wait mmm maybe we should all resort to using the postal service in preference to txt and email and see how long they last,Bad
1129,customer service is the worst of any company ive ever had to deal with as just one example it took nearly hours on the phone to try to extricate myself from the clutches of this company a simple action to close my account nearly drove me round the bend,Bad

1135,attempted a switch over from sky to talktalk has been the most painful placed with a target of almost a month for talktalk to get all in place which we thought was date came and went we are now weeks after the supposed almost months since placing the order and still no sign of any internet no followup calls from talktalk its all us doing the chasing while customer services are friendly enough they are ineffective all of the numerous calls and web chats have been pointless no one can provide a solution or firm answer as to when we can expect an internet connection we work from home for most of the week so the last weeks have been increasingly difficult throw in a break with no internet for our son and weve finally reached the end of our given up on chasing talktalk for a resolution and gone with another provider talktalk promised so much but delivered so little with internet providers you really do get what you pay not one for leaving negative reviews but our experience really does justify a bad,Bad
1136,whats the point in unlimited internet if youre going to slow the internet down to unusable speeds after gigs its such a bloody scam i personally use tons of data using up the gigs in the first day now j cant do anything not even watch a min youtube vid on the lowest resolution if you need data get something else ive just been using this data to download stuff now had it for days and have prob ably used over gig since j play playstation with it but because of the slow down i lag and disconnect every mins if you know internet numbers ive been slowed down to less than kbps complete garbage,Bad

1139,for years i have paid insurance for my iphone after losing my phone on holiday i called vodafone to report and in the good faith that a new phone would be sent asap vodafone informed me that they could not replace my handset iphone s plus because they had none in stock this isnt actually the case as i could have easily purchased one online or from my local store within the hour vodafone simply are not interested in helping existing customers only new business so after years of paying insurance through vodafone i was informed that my phone could not be replaced immediately and they could not tell me when it would be replaced nor did they offer a lesser handset to tide me over in the interim what they did offer me was to go and buy a pay as you go handset which was patronising more than anything else so days have gone by no word from vodafone and still no phone yet im sure ill still be charged a full months tariff please do not use vodafone as you are destined to be unsatisfied just look at the rest of the reviews,Bad

1146,another useless network that refuses to allow conference calling on payg my employer purchased a sim card for this network only to discover the hard way that vodafone refuse to allow payg customer to use conference calls which is vital now the govt want us working form home due to antiquated network with rude incompetent staff in overseas call centres who cannot even understand what a conference call those of you who want to use conference calling like i do try three who actually do allow it on payg as far as i have been told double check before you buy any sim card backward feature they refuse to provide is a missed call alert for those who dont want to use voicemail which tells you if someone called whilst you were unavailable they only offer it if you use voicemail which is pretty stupid,Bad

1165,bad customer satisfaction and service manager she will investigate and come back to me its been a month no call nothing they said it will take days port a number but they cant do it in time and then they mess up everything and then they blame you for not given enough time,Bad
1166,i upgraded my phone weeks ago and was told u would receive my new device the next day after the phone did not come the next i called vodafone and was told the device i wanted is now in back order and would have to wait weeks when the week ended i called vodafone again as i still did nit receive my new device and was then told i would receive within a week from that call long story short i have been told for the past weeks i will revive my new device by the end if the week and its still not here and i have now been told it will be another week im nit holding my breath for it as i have been told this for the past weeks very disappointed with the service and the misleading information i guess ill receive my device whenever all though im already paying for it even tho i dont have it very mad and unhappy customer,Bad
1167,terrible customer service hours and hours on hold rude agents worst there is,Bad
1168,they cannot be contacted by phone only my messaging which they might reply to after many hours i was messaging them back and forth for min to tell me that they were right to charge me for international calls when i was paying for talk international service that i was sold by their salesman as allowing me to make free international calls however their internet speed is top rate,Bad
1169,rang up to pay bill and cancel contract dew to no sig they convinced me to stay they said they would ring me back never did just sent me a over dew bill rang agen same thing same thing third time just rung them after a email say they have tried to ring witch they havent and cancelling my complaint witch is still on honing after months no been put through to faults he said wifi is so bad they are such a terrible company do not use them go with any one els sig starts ok then gose down hill till nothing do not use the company,Bad
1170,i have recently set up the broadband for my new house with virgin media i am yet to move in but already the customer service and experience is terrible i have decided to go for a monthly rolling contract as i have heard the speeds are not great so didnt want to commit long term despite only having a monthly rolling contract virgin have conducted a hard credit search on me this should only be done when applying for credit and as i am on a rolling monthly contract i am not applying for any credit this has adversely impacted my credit score i have tried the web chat and call centre and have not been able to speak to anyone who has any idea what is going on and all the have been able to do is confirm that a hard search should not have been run against me unfortunately virgin is the only provider who can offer a speed faster than mbs but i am hopeful that one of the other will pass the property soon so i can move away from virgin i have never had to use them before and based on this short experience i will never use them again as long as there is any kind of alternative option although virgin have replied to this review i am still waiting for their customer services team to call me back,Bad
1171,ive been with you a lot years now you charge me late payment ive always pay even tho am out of work times are very hard at the moment the internet is very slow and i could go and change to something else but i havent,Bad
1172,very disappointing the wifi booster did not improve coverage in the house if anything it made coverage worse with a lot of complaints from other family members frankly it was a complete waste of money and i wish i had never purchased it,Bad
1173,what an awful experience at the hands of these into a new build in august which did not have broadband connected it was coming in three weeks so needed a temporary fix bt pointed me at explained what i needed ie three weeks worth of internet via a mobile device they sol me a mini router and one months worth of data for expensive but short term so ok i checked that i could cancel at any time ie not a fixed term contract and was assured that i cancelled three weeks later having paid for three weeks months later i received a threatening letter saying that i owed them another for unpaid months worth of data this was followed the next day by a letter from a debt recovery cut a long story short i have ended up paying almost in total for three weeks data i should have taken it to the ombudsman but frankly life is too short and i wanted rid of worse is that although the sales person checked reception in my area the thing wasnt even fit for purpose and i only ever got mbps download well clear of ee is my advice,Bad
1174,on december my vodafone number was ported across to but ive just discovered that vodafone botched up and im still being charged by vodafone plus im paying has confirmed that they received all the necessary information from vodafone on december but vodafone is denying hadnt received the information from vodafone they wouldnt have been able to port my current number yet it was ported on december ive made phone calls to vodafone today twice i was cut off when i was being transferred and ive been on the third call for over minutes now and still not sorted vodafone at all costs,Bad
1175,broad band far too expensive looking for another let us drop landline and just have broadband,Bad
1176,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
1177,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
1178,moved to from ee only to find i cannot use my monthly allowance of air time or data as the coverage in my home and within metres of the house is non existent on complaining from the bottom of my garden and standing on a bench was told that their system shows there is coverage in my postal code as their web site detailed when i researched prior to signing a contract to resolve this matter and more importantly to keep my tele number of almost years i would have to cancel the contract and pay the outstanding monthly payments on the month term i have no option but to pursue the company through the ombudsman and failing that through the courts no company should hide behind its failings in the hope that its unhappy customers fade away,Bad
1179,worse service ever recieved glad to be away from them,Bad
1180,after the recent letter with information regarding the price increase i called virgin media as it stated in the letter i had the right to cancel when calling them the first person i spoke to was very understanding the second however from the termination depth was not helpful at all and proceeded to tell me that even tho they had broken the contract i still had to by the rules of it by giving days notice thus resulting in a bill of to end the contract even tho they broke the contract they will not be getting paid as they have broken the terms and they are a bullying company who needs to have a good look at themselves worst customer service and want you as a customer to play by their rules when they are at fault avoid at all cost because when something goes wrong they will charge every penny they can,Bad
1181,terrible customer service line quality awful unhelpful advisers low broadband speeds regular dropouts and numerous technical issues throughout my time with them complicated and expensive cancellation process,Bad
1182,i have just spent hour and mins on the help chat line any concerns and questions that i said were totally disregarded or just completely ignored after all this time nothing has been resolved as apparently the system again had an error i would not recommend talk talk to anyone as it seems to be a constant battle with the service which they are supposed to be providing my telephone line had a fault for three weeks but i had kept being told there was no error they then asked for on top of my normal bill disgusting customer service,Bad
1183,unbelievable cant communicate properly systems that fail to that are clearly stupid sends me a bill that shows that my account is in credit and tries to tell me that a credit balance means nothing doh,Bad
1184,hi so pleased to see this thanks for posting your review jo talktalk social team,Bad
1185,however good any deal this company may offer you ignore it and go somewhere else none of their hardware works and their customer service is absolutely atrocious we moved to them from sky days ago and have just exercised our right to cancel under the day cooling off period its back to sky we go they may be awful but theyre products at least work occasionally,Bad
1186,four months in on month contract that clearly states no price increases for the duration of the contract guess what price has increased only have short window month to move elsewhere or get stung with early termination fee not really when working from home they have me right where they want even new terms state increase will be cpi so less than in total but the enforced increase they have implemented is so yet more their web page why choose talktalk it says weve always played fair it did make me laugh as did the rest of the text obviously for me the crux of the issue is that they said they dont increase prices and then they do saying we need to increase prices as their justification and up with talktalk you will regret bartenders,Bad
1187,vodafone make systematic and regular wrong charges and take this from your direct debit without permission when customer service is contacted they do not refund and hide behind a huge smoke screen saying that the problem is complex it isnt and can take months to look into personally i have taken county court action against vodafone i write this review to make others aware of their malpractice and disgusting customer service please heed this advice do not use vodafone,Bad
1188,atrocious customer treatment and experience avoid at all costs ee are a bully company that will do their utmost to ensure they dont fulfil the promises of their plan eg if your phone dies they will try and get out of fixing it by sending it to a third party while simultaneously making it impossible to find out how to end your plan once the agreed contract time is up so they expect you to keep paying once you have stopped using your phone never again will i use ee and i have told all my friends and family to cancel contracts with them as soon as possible,Bad
1189,i joined talktalk on the and i can honestly say this has been one of the biggest mistakes ive ever made i have not gone a full month with my broadband working fine i find myself calling them at least times a week sometimes ill go days without service the longest ive gone without service was days and once again my service is down im going to cancel my contract and move to another company i would avoid talktalk as theyre not worth it,Bad
1190,working at home is an essential part of my job and not being able to phone talk talk customer services and speak to a person when things go wrong with their service is a deal breaker as far as im concerned very poor customer service and still no idea why my wifi is so slow and some of my online phone calls had failed to connect with my customers while working at home,Bad
1191,trash internet autism rude customer service,Bad
1192,worst broadband ever every other day it stops working my girlfriend is trying to work from home and is finding it extremely difficult with the inconsistency of the broadband whenever ive tried to call about it its just an automated message that doesnt help me in the slightest ive also tried speaking to an actuall person but they were more useless than the automated message not impressed at all,Bad
1193,my mum is ill and in her s and cannot wait four hours to speak to a customer advisor if i could give virgin media a rating of less than star then i would they are a disgrace and their customer complaints department is even worse they just take around in circles without any resolution her bill has doubled in one month stay away from virgin media as they are a truly bad company,Bad
1194,terrible company poor customer service very expensive i have spent four days explaining to them that i am not closing my account they got confused as a downstairs neighbour moved in i informed them yet they closed the account any way despite two operatives saying they wouldnt currently hours into hours until my service should resume i am not holding my breath,Bad
1195,went to change from pay monthly to payg and ee has closed my account with no notification whatsoever yet they have happily been taking my money for this closed account my mobile number was exclusive as my dad bought it for me and he has since passed away i am so annoyed as its one of the only things i have left of him rotten service im actually appalled they could do this without letting me know yet happy to take my monthly direct debits,Bad
1196,i agree with everything i have read on virgin media today they are the most frustrating company to deal with its virtually impossible to speak to anyone i have virgin broadband only at properties and previously considered they had the best broadband product back in my area broadband went down for plus days and i have a doctor renting every day they said it would be up and running that afternoon sadly not it was non existent so the doctor went and got her own broadband meantime i have written times since the sept to karen walker in sunderland and all i get is the same letter acknowledging my complaint now they threatening the bailiffs and my credit rating and keep asking me to call them well i just have and i informed them i want compensation for non service stop sending me overdue bills action required threatening the credit agency recovery i do not want anymore phone cals or texts from virgin only communicate in writing or email and settle this matter and lets all move on i have even written to the chairman nothing this is an unbelievably bad organisation,Bad
1197,very dissapointed by virgin my contract with vm and on the phone i have been told that i will pay a certain monthly subscription and when i first saw my direct debit it was with month i am stuck with them for more than a year wait for it to finish so i can expecting different from them but its all about money,Bad
1198,if i had the choice i would have given them zero star the biggest robbers on earth the worst possible experience i had with vodafone uk thanks got my number transferred to a different network today before months of completing my contract with them this is self explanatory that i was so disappointed with their services that i preferred to switch to a different network months before completion of my contract not at all recommended if you want to save your money do not even think to join these robbers every single thing will cost you a fortune,Bad
1199,not one bit happy with customer i never leave bad reviews anywhere but what i had to deal with now was a complete joke and disgraceful i know it is always busy but what got to me was i had to wait in the queue to speak to someone for mins and when they finally answered to me the man told me i was put through to the wrong department so then he connected me to what was meant to be the correct department and after minutes of waiting again a woman answered and said hello twice very quickly and hung up on me i expect a response to this review because i am not happy at all with this and not a chance im going through all of that again just to be hung up on after waiting minutes seriously sort yourselves out if you want better customer satisfaction,Bad
1200,absolutely worst network in bristol clifton g not g or gin many places especially inside the houses on the country no network in a lot places edge or g only which is an dont recommend this pro max ios,Bad
1201,was offered a fifty pound credit on joining never received after calling and being assured it will be sorted,Bad
1202,worst network and worst customer experience ever worst experience ever do not repeat do not get a phone contract with vodafone i had a pay monthly phone and once that contract was finished i made the final payments and that should have been it however on my credit score its comin up loads of missed payments and says the account is in default which is seriously affecting my credit score this is a mistake on end as i know i paid it and didnt miss any bills ive contacted customer service to try and sort it but they are messing me around passing me here there any everywhere finally got through to the right team on facebook as they said there no number to ring for who i need and theyre leaving days and days between replies and arent getting anything sorted absolute disgrace of a network hope it crashes and burns seriously if youre thinkin of going vodafone dont literally better off with nothing,Bad
1203,used these clowns at talktalk after using many previous clowns all equally as hopeless as the next my broadband speed is atrocious a month contract with tt which was around it went up to after a year which i think is being made illegal i realised my year was up they were charging me for mbps i cancelled by sending them an email stating that it was bad enough paying over for mbps but paying for this speed just aint to tt you have to call them to cancel a contract an email isnt legit i told them that the email i used was the one they have on file i dont want to speak to anyone generally anyway ive emailed you i had a year contract the year is now up go whistle dixie your service stinks theyre now chasing me for around odd which im not paying im getting debt collectors emails phone calls etc these broadband clowns are getting away with absolute robbery all the broadband companies by using the post office supermarkets the lot just to hide who they really are its rental what a joke just another excuse to get more cash off an already ripped off are a joke should hang their heads in shame goodbye to the lot of them forever,Bad
1204,you are too expensive and you cant be contacted easily,Bad
1205,im signed up to an month contract for landline broadband using the city fiber network the connection speed is very good usually in excess of mbps up and downi have had fiber from various providers all of which used the network and have had no noticable issues with moving to vodafone i have had multiple service outages its just really poor that your broadband can be down for hours on end of course theres then no easy way to report your issue either unless you want to sit on hold on the phone for mins to be told to reset your router to factory settings etc,Bad
1206,i was introduced by a friend to virgin media as it had a fast internet speed and my sky package could not improve my service and was getting silly bills in every august i changed to virgin with a package that was agreed on for phone rental charge which was for yr then increased to per was then given the date of connection of th august the engineer turned up to install it on time but then went from bad to worse he struggled to find away to run the cables to the house when he got to the front door he said he could not drill hole through the door frame also could not go to the back of the house to install the cable to the back bedroom eventually he made some shoddy attempt to do the job then said he could not install the phone that day as the signal from the box was broken he called his manager out to check it out to which he said they would have to come back another day to finish it and would be in touch well months down the line i am still waitin for my phone to be installed i have made live chats that lead know where been in the shop leading know where then get a phone call to say they were coming last thursday rd december to put the phone in yes you guessed it they came and still could not do it with out digging up my drive at a cost to me so virgin as far as i am concerned you can now do one you have been taking full price of per month instead of for months now so i am going to cancel my contract as you have broken your so called contract with me,Bad
1207,extremely poor service and they are over priced they will do everything to stop you from getting through to customer services and keep transfering you to different departments,Bad
1208,reply to the answer received i need to mention i am not on social media no facebook no instagram so if there is anyway to contact i ordered twice back in march the new full fibre package and they did a credit check on me got about emails confirming the order and the installation then they cancelled the order after days and i didnt knew that until i called them we placed another order and another emails saying is all happening and that one was cancelled as well after days and again i called just incase as no one seemed to send me at least an email to say it has been cancelled now i have on my clear score an account active with vodafone for a service that i dont have tried various times to get in touch and aparently they cant locate me on their system and was told a supervisor will call me in days time in the morning and that was days agothe star review is because i got emails everytime i ordered something but nothing to say it has been cancelled so i could have waited long time for them to come and install me if it werent for me calling them,Bad
1209,beware if your contact expires at specific date you still have to give days notice what a joke got caught into paying one more month of overpriced internet never coming back to virgin,Bad
1210,services are unreliable not as varied as competitors and customer service is woeful,Bad
1211,i am with for more than a year it used to glitch occasionally but in general it was ok especially when you could mix and match your calls in uk and abroad for a tenner however recently it is just going down with acceleration trying to send sms fail trying to make calls fail internet not working selecting a bundle with special codes fail it is difficult to get to their technical support waiting times are about min but when calls are dropped several times before you can actually talk to somebody it becomes hours one of the new tricks you need to press a number on a keypad to talk to support and the system does not recognize the number you pressed when i managed to get to someone finally it was an indian lady who could advice a couple of basic tricks like restarting the phone if problem goes deeper they just log the complaint my complaint is logged several days ago and nothing changed so far nothing is fixed and nobody contacted me either,Bad
1212,engineers on separate dates cant repair a fibre connection engineers caught for lying both said they were refused entry into our home when they actually came inside took one look at our router and said they could not repair the connection witnessed by our son then other engineers caught outside our home inside their vans playing on their phones for minutes then drove away avoid this company at all cost,Bad
1213,i bought a mobile from tesco mobile with the understanding that i could use of clubcard vouchers towards monthly payments until the ran out i would not have bought the mobile without this arrangement the vouchers were paid up front when the mobile was purchased i have just called tesco mobile for the th time to tesco mobile having discovered that they are still taking monthly payments directly from my account they have had chances to honour the contractual agreement and failed every time based on my experience outlined above i would strongly advise people to avoid tesco mobile,Bad
1214,please find an alternative broadband provider to cant comprehend how companies as large as talktalk and are so inept and been without broadband for days now and they cant manage to book and engineer between them ive spent nearly hours on the phone over the last day and wasted half a day off waiting for an engineer not to turn upi only scored star as isnt urge you not to use talktalk,Bad
1215,you need to call up and wait in a queue to cancel to protect the data of their customers however you do pretty much everything else online including move your account to a new address funny how people who want to stay with the company are less subject to data protection,Bad
1216,hi mr mrs langford im sorry to hear that you are having an issue with your internet connection i appreciate its been a while since you left your review so hopefully things are resolved now but if not please have a look here from that link youll be able to check if theres a fault in the area test your line replace your equipment or book an engineer visit if its links will also help to keep things tip top for you general broadband help status page hints and tips troubleshooting you are still having further issues then please get in contact with us so we can help you further we have a vast variety of ways to contact us for help or support and i have listed a few here for you call text facebook twitter forums other contact options can be found here,Bad

1218,canceled my contract back in may payed phone off so should have just had month at for usage and then what ever else i used days later but no o got greedy took days later and then took the same amount again this month best part about all this is i have a new baby getting made redundant ontop so just had enough for bills in bank thank you to o direct debts have bounced and now i will be charged from my bank ontop of this but when ive spoke to them there not willing to pay the bank charges for there mess jokes the lot of them,Bad
1219,myself and partner are in australia atm im using global roaming and paid for days which is mins and texts and gb data my partner is using and paid for global roaming her charges are astronomical in comparison to mine just to switch her internet on and check emails is costing of her calls be had my internet on as im using maps to drive and have just used the last of my gb in days she ran out of her credit this evening and it cost p to add credit is ripping people off its expensive not that mine is cheap but heck,Bad
1220,os ageing network in my opinion is declining and is shocking when it comes to customer service i managed to end my airtime contract early after months of fighting with o over no longer being covered by their services and with no fix i still had some of the handset to repay which i didnt deny owing however a really shady practice of o is for them to cancel the handset contract and demand full payment straight away as theres no airtime contract then after much fighting being allowed only to set up a month payment plan for the remainder of the handset while the payment plan is in place these cretins are effecting my credit score by putting the account in query while the amount is being paid off i am being penalised because o are a poor network on every level right from the physical network to customer services to business practices avoid like the plague unless you want unimaginable levels of stress,Bad
1221,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
1222,virgin media o joined forces i didnt receive my volt upgrade which i was entitled to as a customer of both two calls to o before they said they granted it me email confirming this this should have doubled my data allowance for o from gb up to gb months later and im still waiting signed into my app on my mobile it still says i only have gb not gb not pleased and very disappointed with both virgin media and o they appear to only pay lip service to their customers they offer apparent automatic upgrades but dont fulfill on their promises dont believe what theyre you its just an apparent gimmick to get you to stay with them,Bad
1223,you are pathetic i have complained almost on a monthly basis for being charged for picture messages that i have never numbers do not even exist in my phone also when my phone died i was advised to buy a cheap phone until it was fixed with the promise that the cost would be paid back to me a lie now when i want to leave because of this customer mis service you charge me to receive my pac the end of my contract sort it out tmobile you will end up loosing all of your customers otherwise i am taking my complaints to the ombudsman because you cannot rip people off like this continually cannot wait to im only putting one star because it wont let me post this with no stars you do not even deserve half a star,Bad
1224,only gave one star because i couldnt go any lower this is so bad can never connect to the internet and needed to change the hub over five time in a year which is very bad dont go with this,Bad

1226,avoid asda mobile at all costs ordering the sim was fine came within working days i then had an issue with switching my number almost got locked out of my account because they wouldnt accept the pac code from my previous provider rang up and gave them the pac code and then it worked months later i requested a pac code from asda mobile to transfer to a new network and according to them i had already given a pac code to a new network no pac had been requested until this point so this now means i have to ditch my old number which i have had for several years and get a new number with the new network also cancelling the bundle shouldnt be as hard as it is tried to cancel it in the app and on the website but was told that it couldnt be cancelled due to an unknown error then phoned up customer support and they managed to sort it out asda mobile is an absolute rip off and if you want to go with a low cost network dont waste your time or money and go with a reputable network such as smarty or,Bad
1227,its not worth it no matter how good it sounds initially i just spent minutes trying to cancel,Bad
1228,worst company ever how do they get away with tricking customers into a sim only contract for just data then change my bill up and add extras that ive said i dont want not only that when you try speak to them they cant get to the point and fix it for you as they are majorly useless they tried blaming as i had a phone contract last year with my phone which was finished last year not only that i asked to leave my sim deal literally just paying for data which they tricked me into a year contract and had the check to charge me,Bad
1229,terrible service do not value customers or even try had a very blunt a rude phonecall today if a customer asks for something you try and look into it not be rude and sarcastic funny how cheery and sweet the phone sales team sound when you are at the end of your contract or if you can be offered an extra line stupid company train your staff,Bad
1230,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
1231,absolutely useless customer service when a deal end date is coming up i wanted to upgrade my package now i think i shall cancel it what a joke,Bad
1232,very disappointed that i ever moved from sky,Bad
1233,worst one they never answer the phone even if you wait in line for hours,Bad
1234,brand prices deals customer service unhelpful pieces of dave,Bad
1235,after countless hours of calls and repeating myself about how bad the phone line is due to the fact they couldnt hear me due to the phone line being so bad the technician arrived to fix the phone line blamed it on the phone and then proceeded to changed the phone and still the phone line is terrible looking forward to leaving bt as soon as the contract has ceased and to be honest i cant wait shame you cant give no stars one is far too many,Bad
1236,shocking mum has been with talktalk for years since they were doing the adverts yeah its been that long for the first few years the internet was ok as it was just her using it for emails surfing etc the internet would cut out a bit and there were a few times where i would feel the router and it felt like it was on fire so i turned it off to let it cool down after this happening for a few years they then sent her out a new router one of the first black ones they did this is where things went wrong the router was meant to be a upgrade and provide wifi in the house so that she could browse on her laptop etc the wifi did not work we only were trying to connect one laptop to it by wifi and it would say cannot connect this meant that my mum had to buy a long ethernet cable to enjoy the internet i complained several times to talk talk and all they wanted to do was send out another router it got to a stage where i refused for my mum to receive another one as they admitted they cannot promise it would solve it i asked them if they would give her a discount as under the regulator ofcom if a company is failing to provide a service you are paying for they should resolve the issue or not charge you for that service talktalk did not and this lack of wifi lasted years until in i went to visit my mum at her place and her contract was up i advised her to look elsewhere and she said no lets give them one more i looked online saw they were offering a month contract a new router no calls etc for cheaper than she had and some free sky stuff i went through removed the talktalk tv as it was no use got it all sorted confirmed it got a email confirming its a month contract and the price then december just gone when i visited my mum again we both assumed her contract would be coming to an end no they changed it to month contract with the tv included now in the past you could go online and remove stuff from your package but you cant do this anymore so now they have tied in a vulnerable customer for longer than she agreed to i promise on my life that when this one ends she will leave talk talk and we wont ever use you again also if anyone wants to talk to them and not be on hold for ages try this number one of their contact centres is based in hull its the one they put you through to if you complain or if your up for renewal its a company called clear answer and there targeted staff there on how many add ons they sell mobiles etc i know this as i made the mistake of working for them in the past,Bad
1237,awful absolutely no customer service broadband slow slow see others have the same problem site needs to challenge these issues more bad service slow slow,Bad
1238,we have had no broadband now for days and have been told it could take up to another three days to get it back an engineer was booked to come out i waited in and no one came no communication from virgin to say the call had been cancelled you call customer services and wait for up to mins for you call to be answered they then say ill speak to the support team and put you on hold which basically means im going to hang up on you with no call back and then the cycle of the customer customer service starts again the service is ridiculous im cancelling my roaming contract as for the price i currently pay i expect a much better service i would never recommend virgin to anyone,Bad
1239,so i was a brand new customer after failed install appointments where arrived after weeks of waiting i give up spent about hours of my life on hold or in the web chat with them being read badly written scripts that didnt answer the questions after given miss information from each representative repeatedly after being talked out of escalating to higher complaints to be told to buy a mobile dongle to temporarily get access to wifi they would credit me back straight away but then told i cant get the credit back for the dongle until the account goes live i decided enough is enough so ive cancelled and im to wait days for compensation and credits to be processed use who have no loyalty to talk talk so turn up whenever regardless of what time your appointment is booked for,Bad
1240,i received a permanent ban for using too much data despite being signed up to the unlimited id been using the data to stream on my ipad and tv without warning or explanation cancelled my all my services leaving me unable to make calls or texts or use g while i wait for a new sim from a new network the worst thing is having to wait nearly hours for a response each time you get in touch especially if its urgent,Bad

1246,one and a half hour of talking on the talk talk customer service chat asking why an account i cancelled on april th was not done on rd may and finally i get a grudging agreement horrible horrible company with horrible horrible customer service only interested in claiming a few pennies from little old ladies or anyone vulnerable between wasting time between answers and copying and pasting answers to ignoring my request for a manager this company cost themselves more in waste that it could possibly have been worth since i refuse to be bullied into allowing them any victory use them at your peril,Bad
1247,i can sum up the service you will get from vodafone in a few sentences terrible phone service if things go wrong little or no customer service when you try to leave they make it dont update your credit file and post incorrect information saying you are in default they dont do anything to resolve these problems despite numerous complaints dont get caught up with the usual cut and paste response to you is if there is anything we can do go to fb or twitter and once there they just ignore you,Bad
1248,report a broken cabinet outside my house over times now days ago still no action from them to come repair thought i might write to santa to resolve,Bad
1249,havent received my product yet due to somthing been wrong with the address even though the address is i will let you know when i receive it,Bad

1251,i am a long standing customer of many years and have a month fixed price package with broadband phone tv and the speed boost i was told the price could not be increased during this they have decided to charge a month extra for the top of their already rubbish broadband i questioned this i was told that the tv does not come within the price guarantee even though they originally said it a cheek my broadband speed varies between mbs and mbs and is often i should have listened to others when they said talktalk was yourself a favour and stay well clear of them,Bad
1252,just crap treated badly at new street clueless guy saying he had sent a sim but did not so had no phone contact for my pay monthly contract got sold a payg yet to no avail terrible performance,Bad

1254,ive been a customer for over years and ive tried at least a dozen times to have a new tv box delivered as existing one isnt working and hasnt been for a long time customer service are not helpful at all now i cant log into my account online total joke of a company avoid at all costs,Bad
1255,virgin media is permitted to operate as a private monopoly and that means they know they can get away with providing terrible customer service with little in the way of consequences look at the fact they dont care about the hundreds of one star reviews theyre getting on been waiting four days for them to put through my upgrade plus their prices are sky you live in an area where you can get any other broadband service i urge you to use it sadly im stuck with virgin media,Bad
1256,i updated my broadband but its gone slower also its too difficult to get through to the customer service,Bad
1257,on the start quality of broadband was brilliant but after few months got really worse everyday internet disappears even a couple times during the day i contacted customer service once and it was nightmare for one hour i tried to explain that im in the place were the problem with internet is these people dont read with understanding im very dissapointed,Bad
1258,i joined vodafone on the th of october and was activated on the th of october my internet was so slow and keep disconnecting i contacted vodafone and after two hours waiting for someone to answer the phone i decided to go online i chatted with someone online and went through everything to sort out y router after half hour into the call my internet disconnected tried to get back online but had to start to conversation all over again after minutes into out checks guess what i lost the connection again each time this happened no one contacted me i managed to get true on the phone and after being passed over six hours later i managed to had someone put my connection on check for three days to find cause of my slow bad internet i told the lady over the phone that i had been online for nearly hours and her answer was so what after days my router was still playing up tried contacting vodafone on number of times over the phone and through the internet eventually they upgraded me to fibre package at a discount and offered new router which never arrived after many calls and online consultation it was found out that there was a fault in my line the engineer repaired my line but my internet was slow and my cooling off period was running out i contacted vodafone and ask for an extension on my and ask for an extension on my cooling off period just to give time for my internet to settle but was turned down i was left with not choice but to cancel my contract i could not risk two years with slow internet i never received an apology even though i was a nurse working in the nhs and working from home because i was being shield but could not do my job because they did not care now ive been left without internet until i find another provider very disappointed not to have internet at christmas time,Bad
1259,we switched over our business phones to this company and was promised that our remaining contract with our previous network provider will be paid and settled as per contract ive received bills now debt recovery companies chasing for this bill which should of been settled by sure telecom when i need to speak to someone no one answers or responds but they are quick to respond when signing up anything else forget about it i will be taking them to small claims court stay away,Bad
1260,similar problem to someone below i upgraded to full fibre that came with higher monthly cost but now the wifi no longer covers the whole apartment rooms are not covered i called the support and they offered that i pay even more monthly so that they can send me a booster to guarantee wifi in every room also no guest wifi option honestly feels like ive been ripped off,Bad
1261,worst customer service you are lucky enough not having to deal with the customer service which is not based in the uk or anywhere in europe then you might find the service you are paying for good however if you have just the slightest issue then you will have to make phone call after phone call and sit there for hours just to be passed from person to person whilst everyone is saying i understand your frustration when they dont after the th call which lasted me yet another hour the issue has still not been resolved and i am paying double for a service that is already included in my bill an engineer had to come around to fix the issue checked with the customer service team several times that i wont be charged twice and yet i am being charged twice and have to spend hours on the phone trying to explain to people what has happened and they completely dont understand a word i am saying so if you are thinking of using talktalk then just pray that you wont have to ever call their customer service with any problems because it will drive you so mad you wish you never signed up with them i am considering cancelling it all after just a month with them,Bad
1262,i receive a jbl sound bar a few days ago all i can say its a load of to set up up over a few days still not working even checked the jbl web site for more having i hadnt received it for free it would be back on its wayi think maybe better recycle bin take another gift,Bad
1263,the help pages create a huge barrier to accessing help first they ask you to look up the answer is kind of ok then there is an option to speak to a virtual assistant but its not even that it takes you to the community which is presumably customers answering questions i then found a number and was cut off once i did get in the communications were slow and frustrating,Bad
1264,i have tried to downgrade my tv package on numerous occasions only to find the operatives would only discuss an upgrade it isnt possible to downgrade your tv package online and call waiting times are in excess of one hour i have been asked to leave feedback times now yet no one from virgin media has contacted me about my experience as a customer of over years standing there are other better providers out there now and i will be leaving virgin media shortly as i am paying for tv channels i dont watch,Bad
1265,shocking customer service no access to bt sport app due to error codes go to live chat and it says minute waiting time minutes later and the waiting time is over minutes dont advise going with bt quick to take your money but wont sort anything out,Bad
1266,absolutely horrendous service unfortunately the english speaking operators really are a struggle to understand ive worked all over the uk and live and work in scotland and even i couldnt understand these folk very well the letter received was sent out with no telephone contact details on the front but buried on the back in small print i was trying to resolve the latest package for an extra per month which my elderly mother didnt want yet everything else is printed in bold print saying what a fantastic offer but no telephone number on the front of this letter and then had the hassle of trying to explain my year old mother cant use a lap top or even know her email address the whole conversation took over and a half hours to make a complaint and to ask them to put a telephone number on their communications nightmare,Bad
1267,hi all just want to share my experience dont expect a good customer service when you join vodafone long waiting times and unhelpful agents rigid processes that makes no sense thanks,Bad
1268,my parents who are intimated their intention to leave virgin on they could not take their phone number that they had had since until they had returned the virgin equipment which they did they then could not get their number ported to bt virgin said the number had to be live to be ported bt said they could not port a live number because that would be like giving my parents their neighbours number on may i managed to get the number disconnected bt are trying to port the number the guy at virgin said it would cost but he thought they would get that back along with the other money paid i said what money to be told that virgin had been charging them a month for a live phone line that noone could call today i called the accounts department my dad was charged when closing the account he said he knew that was too much but it was too hard to try to get his money back so he left it turns out that he then had a credit of on the account it also turns out that because the number remained live virgin have been helping themselves to the credit in his account to the amount of per month that he knew nothing about to pay for a phone line they did not is have refused to refund their money because the charges were legally made despite the phone line staying live because virgin said it had to and them not having that phone at i got assistance from virgin it was because i said my call was about leaving virgin so i got onto someone in the uk who tried to help when i called the billing service i was put onto an operative and manager in the philippines who had no interest whatsoever in the stress that this has put on a couple in their late s just wanting to make sure that virgin keeps they refused to refund the money not a surprise from such a shabby company i hope they find that worth brother is now leaving and i have left virgin none of my family will ever contrast bt have been really good both in my own experience and that of my you are with virgin it is only a matter of time before they treat you badly i would suggest you will spare yourself the misery of dealing with them if you leave as soon as you when i left they kept phoning me to try to get me to stay but refused to speak to me unless i gave them digits from my password as i said to them you called me they said yes but we cant speak to you without digits from your password i said fine and hung virgin as soon as you can and save yourselves the misery of having to deal with them,Bad
1269,awful awful awful customer service ive hated every second of being a talktalk customer constantly ignored talked to like a child mislead and ultimately not helped at all took nearly three hours to get the number for customer from their live chat,Bad
1270,absolutely terrible service if you have a fault on your line reported fault last monday took over an hour to go through the process with their representative had to agree to pay for an engineer to visit my home despite proving fault was outside refundable if confirmed engineer came on the tuesday did no more than i already had done said fault was outside premises and would take upto hours to resolve once to bt days later and nothing got onto talktalk and nothing had been done nor was it going to be if i had not chased them up they then said they would it to bt but that if the fault was proven in the premises i would be charged despite the previous visit of their engineer proving it outside so even though their engineer has visited they want to charge you if he was wrong what a rip off there are the modern day cowboys just pray if you are with talktalk you never get a fault this second encounter took over hours their is a joke i have wasted hours online and on the phone dealing with one fault and days after reporting it no progress they should be ashamed of themselves,Bad
1271,at the end of my contract i cancelled my subscription i got a phonecall from their dept saying that i wouldnt get the same service from other companies that i get at virgin they offered to continue at the same introductory price i said i wasnt interested but asked for the caller to send me details of the conversation in case i changed my mind i never received these details and im still being charged months on despite contacting virgin my router and switching to another company i will be demanding a refund,Bad
1272,ordered a tv as it was a better offer than that in the amazon prime sale the tv arrived with a smashed screen it was days before bt collected the tv and a further days before i had confirmation that i would be getting a full refund ive been without a television for nearly weeks and only now with the refund confirmation in a position to order one but im going to have to buy a more expensive one as the prime sale is over and bt no longer have this tv in stock whilst bt dealt with the tv issue the service was sluggish and im in a worse off position than when i started dealing with them,Bad
1273,congratulations virgin media on a massive improvement in your email service yesterday they were taking hours or more to arrive today you have got the time down to about chance of getting it down to seconds or preferably milliseconds,Bad
1274,they really are the worst customer services i have ever experienced nearly one month later they still havent sorted out their issues numerous phone calls promises everything has been sorted a goodwill payment of and today all my calls and data have been removed im flying abroad tomorrow recorded under complaint cct happy,Bad
1275,i must admit that i am an absentee customer of talktalk so long as things are ticking over smoothly i do not get involved however at a given point i realised that without any notification my monthly bill had gone from to that is when my problems really started i discovered that the billing email address used by talktalk for my contract had been changed i was therefore unable to access the myaccount site to query my billing attempting to use the customer service channels webchat and telephone turned into a hour surreal saga reminiscent of kafka or terry brazil the catch situation i was landed in meant that because i did not know the unknown email address that talktalk had adopted for my account no one in the customer service was able to address the situation they appeared totally blind to the potential case of identity theft that i am involved in insisting that they were protecting my data my situation is probably actually worse than i have sketched here because there is a real danger that i will be unable to terminate my rolling and increasing expensive contract due insistence on protecting me through their policies if i had a choice i would not score talktalk star it would be stars i guess this means a bad score for trustpilot as well take note guys your own blinkered perspective is the hurdle here,Bad
1276,i would rate stars this is the worst company i have ever used tried to cancel a contract months in a row for a phone that doesnt turn on for their customer service to run me in circles with no outcome made me pay outstanding balance before i cancelled even though it was their fault i couldnt cancel earlier then once cancelled continued to bill me,Bad
1277,i am one of their customer and subscribe the gb data plan and used for a few months suddenly all my balance around gbp are gone when i check the balance the strange thing is the balance was still there when i check the day contacted one of their customer service via live chat said all my data allowance are consumed and the balance were also consumed but i never received any notification regarding this they just keep repeating that they will never refund nor do anything to sort it telecom such as do alert their customer when their data allowance used up but not oh i get it when the data allowance used up they will never let their customer know so that they can consume all the prepaid the way they maximize their is just unfair after a few struggle with their customer service theres still no use they will never do anything simply because thats the way they make one more thing if they said theyve sent a notification when percent of allowance consumed its just meaningless percent of gb is a data run out notification and continue to charge money thats just pounds can let our trustpilot users to stay away telecom like this im willing to pay the dear please do not contact me im tired of your excuse and attitude no one will keep checking the data quota hourly please do not keep repeating those nonsense without answering the real question,Bad
1278,phone line not working contacting talktalk everyday now and getting no where at all not happy with the way i am getting treated at all and guess what they left message on hear saying get intouch with then on facebook so i did asked me what problem was very nice of them but soon as told them the problem message came up saying dont understand choose a b c or d they ment to be phoning me tonight as promised im not holding my breath company is a they did get intouch did more tests and said was outside fault and they would contact outreach and guess what internet gone off now as well as phone at last the phone is on internet on but internet still goes off every hour or so saying cant connect to internet looks like will have to just put up with it cos they not going to sort the problem out,Bad
1279,i have been paying for a tv package for months now however i watch it as the remote is faulty i have ordered a new one twice now with yourselves and still have not received it,Bad
1280,worst company to deal with still charging me for services i cancelled months ago any time you phone its someone who doesnt speak good english who answers and usually with a terrible attitude online chat cuts out and you need to start again broadband was constantly cutting out would not recommend,Bad
1281,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad
1282,please never had to write a bad review on this website before but after my horrific experience with this company i have to write id like to say that i have been a loyal customer with since jan everything started off amazing and the plan was supposed to be for pm home first few months went perfect internet connection was super quick and there were no extra charges exactly a charge each month as agreed to end of i sometimes would have a minor issues but nothing they couldnt forward to this year i do not know what happened to this company but the customer service is now an absolute joke like seriously the people that you speak to just blatantly lie to your face and dont even write the correct notes on their systems so you have to repeat everything they put you on hold for over minutes while they do nothing just to come back to you and tell you of this year my internet connection has suddenly changed and started to be slow and then it would cut out at times i am working from home so this was badly affecting me during my shifts not only that but i also had realised that the bill had been increased to and then to i have no idea why that happened or why is hasnt been changed after i complained about it i never added any sort of extra onto the not even the main problem weeks ago i was sent a new router as my internet had been cutting out as usual after an engineer had to be sent out to make sure my internet was actually not working their words not mine first weeks it was working as it should but then all of a sudden just days ago it completely stops working again like the connection is literally dead i cant connect my phone and i see the bars on my screen but the actual internet is not working at all i have been on the phone for over hours for the past days and they have been telling me it will be sorted in the next hours for the past days in a row nowi have been patient with them as i know they once used to be am amazing company with brilliant service and have kept hope in them i have now taken the decision that i will have to cancel the contract and leave there is being patient and then theres being taken for a mug and blatantly being lied to every day i work from home i have g bills to pay that you are preventing me from doing you will happily take my money when its time to pay but you fail to deliver simple services that youre supposed to do in the first place why are you restricting my internet that i pay for and youre not even fixing the problem after so long why am i not getting called back to update me as this is not my fault at do i have to keep being told hours your internet will be restored but it never happened was this company sold to someone else or something and less money has now put into i seriously cant figure out what it is but this company will loose a lot more customers if they dont fix over if you got to the advise is to steer well away they are a con see if you reply to this one,Bad
1283,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad
1284,better offers and prices of talktalk but when it came to installing the cable in the ground they ended up scratching the front of my vehicle i had a damage claims manager come out and investigate the scratches the overall investigation was not conclusive and they never done anything about it or took the damages on there behalf to resolve this i was supposed to be at home on the day of the install but by miscommunication they came on the day i was not prepared for they left inch scratches on the front bonnet not a happy customer at all virgin media what a let down i had the highest expectations im now having to pay to fix this bad customer service,Bad
1285,constant from virgin the guy who picked up was service couldnt stop the calls emails texts and letters to harrass me on an error that virgin made either procedures are limiting and not customer focused or the company doesnt care bought virgin as was sold on their world class speed internet had nothing but issues and its anything but world class constant drops speed lag and excuses been told multiple incorrect things when i got in contact to solve the issues or complain,Bad
1286,we have been with virgin media for over years and in all that time have never been offered any discounts on services or any incentives to stay with virgin i would have thought long service would deserve some incentive to stay with you,Bad
1287,one word buffering so bad,Bad
1288,very disappointed how much i would be changed to end my contract early,Bad
1289,i would give it no stars if possible trying to cancel a contract over the phone for my daughter who lost her sim card in thailand or by web chat where they just dropped the chat they are charging her for months of non use and her contract ran out months ago plus another months fee for the privilege of cancelling it seems impossible to cancel the contract,Bad
1290,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
1291,worst internet going lie about speeds and their hardware is sky or i wouldnt i dont jump to reviews as a first step ive had months of your call centres and engineers telling me the same crap over and over rather than resolving your terrible service when my contract is up its back to bt and i wont leave again,Bad
1292,if there was a i would give no customer support cannot talk to anyone landline down again for days th time over last year and no compensation even though asked for i was promised engineer visit pm and have ref number for today but had text saying they had fixed when they had not no engineer turned up tried ringing on my mobile which is not virgin media and used up fed up with this joke of a company,Bad
1293,i had weeks to find a company after leaving sky i ordered talk talk fibre i got a order id with a installation date days later no email went on chat and different people couldnt find order i gave them benefit of doubt and tried again days i received order number i even received top cashback and yet no email or text so spent an hour on the chat being told again by different people no order disgrace,Bad

1296,avoid avoid avoid they are the worst company telecom company i have ever dealt with they are unprofessional irrepressible unhelpful if you are looking for the worst of the worst then talktalk business is where you find them they will mess you and your business around no clue about customers or service it department is ignorant about it customer services only apologise continuously but do nothing to assist in anyway there are better services for cheaper out there avoid these muppets,Bad
1297,despite being the faster broadband provider virgin media provides an incredibly poor to move homes was given an installation date of a month after we move in despite calling a month in advance of the move we were also promised a better deal additional channels and a broadband upgrade at a cheaper price so we thought okay let us wait we got the broadband upgrade but had no additional channels as a matter of fact we had channels technician that installed in our new home left our phone uninstalled he said someone else will install it and we should recieve a call to let us know when a month later we decided to call to find out what was happening as our monthly bill was also higher than what we were promised by sales for our we had a higher bill no phone and we had less channels in order to finally get this resolved we had to call virgin media at least times each time we had to speak with at a minimum of different people and each time explaining ourselves to the new person and never being taken seriously one representative even asked if i was having a laugh calling for the fun of it basically he said you verbally agreed to the package you have so i explained again we dont have what we were offered or what we originally had so why are we paying more his response was thats how we work here at virgin it was as if he wasnt even listening he was just checking the system and what the system says thats it soo much more to say but dont even have the yes its nice having mbps broadband but it would be even nicer if the broadband would stay up for more than days in a row,Bad
1298,hello thanks for taking your time to leave a really sorry to hear of the concerns youve do have a complaints code of practice here so if you do want to make a complaint we would advise following one of the steps as outlined here we can get things resolved for you as soon as,Bad
1299,fake fibre as copper is used to deliver the service why advertise as full fibre if it isnt one,Bad
1300,the reception is totally inadequate slow ive asked for someone to come have a look at the box because wires loose and always has been but you tried to charge us for technician to come look kind regards one unhappy family,Bad

1302,still waiting for customer services to ring back m now over weeks absolutely garbage need time to look at other suppliers to move away from virgin,Bad
1303,very disappointed with talk talk ive been with them for a few years and never had any issues when i was moving home i thought why not take them over i called and got a young man on the phone who offered me a good deal at a fair price when i moved i found out some of the package was not working when i called i was fold that this would be an additional cost on top of the cover when i complained the call handler was apologetic however offered no solution to the problem stating a manager would call back i have still have not heard from talk talk and will now report to ofcom for miss selling its a shame how the lack of ownership and customer service in their office can ruin a companys reputation,Bad
1304,couldnt change password successfully so cant get in touch so so hard when your busy,Bad
1305,keep away from this useless set up youll suffer from the worst poor service possible and then when cancelling they just run rings around you for days preventing you from doing so there is a youth titled retention agent employed there named dexter but i suspect thats his stage name if anyone knows his real identity and location please publish it on here he hides behind his computer taking the mickey most folk who could find this boy would enjoy seeing him to applying due treatment appropriate to the infant he is by smacking his bottom until he cries use virgin media at your peril if you cancel send a recorded delivery letter and stop any standing order their phone or whats app system will grind you into submission,Bad
1306,dont fall for the stay fast to bt may and my line was very reliable had no issues in september it dropped out one evening for a few hours once it came back its been so up and down every couple of days im supposed to get mbps with guaranteed speeds of mbps but it drops quite often to anywhere between had my first engineer out a month ago just kept grunting at me when i told him any of the problems he changed my wall socket and said it was had the problem so i phoned again about a week ago the guy on the phone told me i have hive heating i probably had a hole in my wire which was slowing my broadband down he booked me an engineer out a few days later between i explained i worked until to which he said the engineer would arrange a time with me the engineer rang me asking where i was and fuming i wasnt home when id booked this appointment i told him id be home within half an hour he did stick around but claimed i had no issues with my dropped out again within that evening and at its lowest read mbps tried ringing customer services again this afternoon where i got the lady i think ive ever spoken to telling me i had nothing wrong with my broadband was explaining extensive tests were done on my line and there are no issues but there clearly is an issue if it keeps dropping the call dropped see i rely heavily on wifi calling as my signal is poor in my area the call dropped because my wifi suddenly dropped out all my devices went off and tests were reading mbps once it was back up and through to another agent who did genuinely seem like she wanted to help me but her only solution was to book another engineer out claiming its more than likely a faulty router it my next phone call will be tomorrow to pay out my contract and switch to another provider i hoped id get away with a free termination with the stay fast guarantee but what a joke that is ive got no choice but to pay early termination fees,Bad

1365,staff in the harrogate store are unfriendly and you phone customer service everything seems to be dealt with by different departments resulting in you going round in circles repeating yourself and being given conflicting of the call centre agents are absolutely useless and dont seem to be able to understand even basic concepts with the rare exception of when you actually manage to get through to someone for whom english is their first of the network leaves a lot to be desired as for example if you have more than one number on your account and make a change to that number all numbers on the account will be texted with review refers to all interactions i have had with vodafone and not just one bad experience,Bad

1397,oh please one star is way too generous talktalk are the most appalling internet service provider ever i received a leaflet in the post and decided to give them a call as i was thinking of leaving my current provider anyway well i called and unbeknownst to myself at the time i was stitched up like a kipper because the initial call handler was ever so polite was english and very charming and understanding to my needs even going as far as saying they have uk call centres she offered me unlimited calls to any uk landline or mobile network for an extra per month which i declined i initially agreed to sign up on the she took my bank details etc and said i would receive my router on or before and would go live on however by the th august i had still not received my router no letter by post or any emails nothing i called them and was transferred to different call agents yes seven times in the duration of the call all of them were in bombay or somewhere in india and could barely speak or understand the english language in fact when i mentioned to one call handler that he did not quite understand my dialect he came back with ahh yes sir i am female dalek yes dr who right i mean come on you simply couldnt make that up could you i explained i had not received my router and asked why he did not know but assured me i was going live on when i said this was actually not possible without a router he hung up yesterday i called them again to say i wished to cancel as i had changed my mind and i was still within my day cooling off period the call handler barked at me and demanded i return the router but when i said i had not received one he yelled liar this morning i found my broadband with my current provider had been disconnected on calling them i was told this was because my new provider had told them i was leaving and they cannot reconnect me for another six weeks as well as this talktalk have taken the first two months payment by direct debit including the for the unlimited calls i am currently in touch with the fraud team at my bank as they have charged me for something i do not have disgusting company never go with these scamming cowboys,Bad
1398,virgin media is rubbish even with two internet boosters in my property i still experience slow service or sometimes i loose my internet connection completely gave them a call and nothing was resolved regret ever going back to virgin shouldve stayed away and never have returned,Bad
1399,ive been a customer of virgin from ancient times when they were actually cable and wireless they truly have a noteworthy legacy in how theyve managed to get worse year on year ever year in every aspect as a loyal customer expect them to flip you over and crank your bill up until the pips squeak for example for a package then when i tell them im leaving they inform me they can do the package for per month so purposely ripping me off to the tune of per month per its not just ripping loyal customers off that they excel at their customer service is truly legendary even cancelling my contract was a painful experience the easiest way to cancel should be online but strangely enough it goes to a page resulting in bad gateway hmmmm then it was a minute wait to speak to someone explain the same to someone else then to add insult to injury they absolutely spammed me for days with phone calls to convince me not to cancel if you want broadband you might want to look at wifi broadband if you have a g broadband signal youre laughing but even g is usable for netflix gaming etc expect to pay about per month without landline or tv,Bad
1400,my internet dosent work at all im paying for and im getting megabits when i call virgin they have refuse to send me a engineer and if i want to cancel my contract they want me to pay cancelation fee horrible service and team doesnt even have training about terms and condition,Bad
1401,ive been a customer of virgin media for over years and also a prior customer of within this time ive had tv phone and more recently broadband services on a package with an average monthly spend of two months ago i noticed a promotional package being advertised that would reduce my bill by per month without reducing any of the services it was a and so i switched the following month my bill came in at about as it came with a rebate as a result of the switch to the new package however this month when the bill landed in my inbox the total was over shocked by the increase i called their customer service line to find out what had happened to my surprise i was informed it was as a result of my phone package being changed and the all inclusive calls benefit being removed i explained that this was a mistake and i only switched my package as i understood that the services would not be changed i requested that the call charges be removed as i would not have previously paid for them and that this was not my mistake the first person i spoke to did not seem to be bothered about my issue and felt it more important to inform me that it was my responsibility to check the contract that would have been issued i then asked to speak to a manager who when i was eventually put through was even more obnoxious and adamant that it was my responsibility to have checked the contract and that i should have reported any errors within days i did try to explain to chris that i had only just noticed the error and was calling as soon as the problem had come to my attention all chris seemed to want to do was quote terms and conditions to me rather then help resolve my problem my last chance was to call back and try the retention team after that i would have spent over with them over the last years i asked again for the additional call charges to be removed as i felt this was their mistake to my surprise all they were prepared to offer was an upgrade back to my previous package for an additional per month no matter how i tried to get my message across they just did not seem to grasp how disappointed i was with the error i asked if they really wanted to lose a long standing customer who has always paid on time who also used a number of other virgin services the answer is apparently yes ive now cancelled by direct debit along with all my services whilst this will be somewhat inconvenient initially out of principal i will never use any virgin branded product ever again goodbye virgin hello sky also goodbye virgin holidays virgin money and virgin mobile i really cant believe this is how mr branson would want customers to be dealt with or perhaps after reading these other reviews it is,Bad
1402,rubbish customer service and rubbish network if you dont want to make your life stressful dont take talktalk network absolutely crap service i been charged double last few months rang customer service after hour call they dropped my call mentioned with hours manager will call me back no manager called me back top of that my internet cutoff i am working from home they can not fixed my line saying hours i am loosing my wages as well i had to call them twice every hour they dropped my call,Bad

1405,beware per minute to call europe it is free to call from europe to uk but costs to call from uk to europe utterly unjustified cost as surely you are using the same network either way and i was told by the customer service lady it is because apparently uk is not in eu and when i dared to contradict i was told that it is because they are leaving eu have been a loyal customer for a very long time mostly call abroad through wifi type of apps but last week accidentally called via o network what a mistake to make per minute i think thats mad what century are we in needless to say i canceled my contract immediately with the company even that meant talking to about people all of whom seemed surprise i wanted to leave and apparently its normal to charge this much because they tell you so on their website huh just because its legally allowed doesnt mean its right or moral,Bad

1430,i renewed broadband contract with these guys after an month contract including line that as we very rarely use the landline we would not pay extra for unlimited landline use so did ask for this to be removed from the new month contract days after the cooling off period i saw the direct debit amount to ee was higher that should have been so up to find out why i was informed that the additional charges incurred related to local landline calls which is charged at p for connecting to the landline then charged p per minute per minute been via the ee complaints department i was informed that it was my responsibility to effectively carry out due diligence at the point of sale by clicking on an mail link where i could peruse all there various contract details cost for contacting mobiles overseas charges argument that the most basic detail of a local landline cost is the most relevant fact that l should have be made aware of at the point of sale particularly as i was removing the bolt on add on for unlimited land line use was not considered as relevant my argument that deferring people at a point of sale to what is essentially small print and i have no doubt designed to catch people out via email links etc is not ee should not be able to provide a partial sales service by telephone it should be either comprehensive or provision of a written contract or an online sale removes the risk of being misinformed omission of essential information that one would make to come to an informed decision really disappointed that this was not resolved by ee rather i was informed it would be passed on as feedback internally with my complaint being closed i was prepared to settle that there had been misunderstanding request that the landline charges were reimbursed and offset with what essentially is a compulsive bolt on of a month for unlimited landline calli am now left with the prospect of paying to break contract which frankly i will probably do as there are some fantastic cashback broadband packages available via quidco which will offset this have contacted the ombudsman to review wether they feel this constitutes fair look at the below response from it reasonable that someone is going to read page mb contempt and failing to address the explicit points raised within the,Bad

1519,i have been a customer of vodafone for years it has not been a brilliant experience and their customer service varies hugely depending on who answers your phone call if you have had the time to sit on hold for long enough for someone to actually answer but having just got off the phone with them after being tempted into a broadband contract with the offer of a free go pro sounds great per month provided you pay all the little extras eg for the wifi box etc so on calling to set up the account im told that you can not claim the gift until the contract has gone live for days and that i will receive an email when the time it up and i can claim my free gift so days later no i still cant claim my gift i now have to wait an additional days but not to worry i will get an email when i can claim where i will be directed to the website to choose my no email i had however received a letter which sat on my porch while i have been away which details i have days to claim the gift before this carrot which has been so successfully used to lure me into this contract is whisked away so needless to say i dont arrive home to open this letter until after the claim period has ended however even this letter tells me that i would have received a reminder email directing me to claim my gift so i call vodafone to sort this problem outof course after the obligatory waiting around on hold i am told that it isnt actually vodafone who supply the gift and although i have received the email to direct me to claim and the fact that i was totally oblivious to the claiming window which seems to me to be a obvious attempt to avoid paying out on their side of the bargain whilst making it seem like the customers to be clear no where on the original letter offering the broadband free gift deal did mention any sort of restricted time period in which to i feel i have been lead into this new contract with the offer of free tech i would not have taken out this contract had there been no offer of a free gift i tell the vodafone employee on the phone that i want to cancel the contract as its no longer a good deal without the gift but of course now there is a cancellation fee because i have gone over the day period which they made me wait to claim my gift and the cancellation fee is needless to say i cant afford to pay and a half months worth of broadband to leave so very reluctantly i have to remain a vodafone customer i need to say at this point the vodafone employee i spoke to on this occasion did seem to care and offered to reduce the bill to apologies for our i would strongly advise people not to take out contracts with vodafone they do not make good on pro be promises half of the operatives you speak to and their will definitely be problems which you need to call about will give you incorrect information and fob you off onto another department or tell you to call back at another up vodafone customer,Bad
1520,ok if youre looking for an internet provider and are here to see what people think of talk talk because youre considering them an option then heed my words talk talk is a scam a run down of what ive just been through with connected to talk talk about years ago and besides the connection being relatively laggy id say i was content the issue however arose weeks ago when i moved house and needed them to send someone to connect me in my new first conversation seemed relatively easy and they confirmed theyd send no one came the next conversation was with a manager who told us ive taken control of your account and ive confirmed someone will connect you on one came so that evening i called them yet again and they confirmed someone for ill let you decide whether you think they sent someone or actually ill tell they didnt because i didnt receive an email confirming someone would come i gave them a call this morning and they said they had no one booked for might all sound trivial but as a student who cant attend uni due to i need internet access as does my partner who works from home talk talk are a scam because theyre trained to apologize over and over and talk in circles probably why theyre called talk talk theyre all talk and not much to end this they told me theyll get the manager on the phone but i said actually can you just cancel my contract i mean now she said she cancelled my contract and ill receive a confirmation email and letter and the sad part of all of this is i most probably wont receive the email i wont receive the letter and she hasnt cancelled my i wasnt able to leave less than one star,Bad

1524,we have fixed price contract that we paid extra for come the annual inflationary daylight robbery round that the broadband companies love so much they still increased our monthly fee despite being on a fixed rate no price increases contract spent hours on chat and got nowhere they do not respect the legal contract you have in place with them do not ever sign up for a fixed price package with talktalk searching on the internet i found lots of other people reporting the same problem as far as i am concerned i have been lied to and from whats worse is that we contacted them when we received an email stating there would be a price increase and they reassured us there wouldnt be an increase i have it in writing but now they wont let us out of contract dont trust a word they tell you,Bad

1529,i was happy with virgin media service relatively fast speeds with low contention the hub is a terrible piece of equipment but with your own router its star due to the behaviour of virgin media wanted to switch providers so rang to cancel and i was absolutely appalled by the fact that the cancellation team two agents lied directly to me do you know that your new provider will charge for call outs do you know your new provider cannot give you the speeds we do do you know that your new provider wont be as are all lies but i believed the agents if i hadnt investigated all the options already switched and tested before i called to you can say might but you cannot say cannot and other definitive words you dont know my new provider and you dont know what service ive gone with stop lying to people in the hopes they wont cancel its disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourselves,Bad

1533,stay away ive opened a total of live chats this evening all taking between and minutes to count down to at which point it just freezes on the you will be connected to the next available agent for over minutes each time its inexcusable that bt are raking in bn in profits purely because they have such a shameless monopoly and too many shareholders in high places go ahead and paste the same template response directing me to the live chat im complaining about by the way i cancelled my account and youre still charging me,Bad
1534,virgin media ensured that its impossible to cancel their services ive been calling messaging with them on whatsapp for the last days on whatsapp you can expect a reply every hours every time you speak to someone on the phone they cant hear you despite being sat in a silent home with bars of signal and when they finally give up on this pitiful game the real fun begins you cannot convince them that you want to leave them broadband is a basic need they say trying to explain that someone else in the household has managed to secure a better deal under their name so you no longer need this account makes the phone operators react like this is the first time they have heard of such a thing in an instance when i was connected after been on hold for minutes the gentleman started lecturing me about having an attitude something im sure he would have said to a man and when i was borderline begging him to disconnect my broadband after attempting to do so for days straight worst consumer service ever ive never been so tired and upset,Bad

1537,looks like my star review will be buried down with the other reviews i only leave reviews if i truly feel it is necessary and this is very have kept a log of my interactions with virgin media and virgin mobile over the past month and have spent hours and minutes on the phone with representatives or i had an appointment set for the rd of october to have my internet installed the rd of october came and no one came to install i called and they told me that even if they had come they wouldnt be able to install as the external hookups were not done so they guaranteed the exterior work would be complete by the th of october and i would have a new appointment for the th of october supplementing the issue with a wireless dongle that would be delivered in called back to check on the status of the delivery of the dongle and the form was submitted incorrectly so they resubmitted and promised a call back to confirm the delivery no call back i called and they told me that yet again the form was submitted incorrectly and they would fix that issue i never received the the th of october the tech did come out to install my internet but when he arrived at the property he found that the exterior cables were never installed but their internal system marked it complete on the th of october he is making calls to his manager to fix the issue and gave me his number to give me updates on the status of the issue i can commend him as he has been kind and useful in this horror i called virgin media and virgin mobile to figure out the dongle situation after hour and minutes on the phone they attempted to run me through the same process they had the last two times to process the order of the dongle until they hit a systems error and hung up promising to call me back in minutes that time has passed and i never received a call my next call is to cancel their services and find a provider that will actually do the job correctly and value their users if you have made it this far into the review my recommendation is to steer clear of virgin media virgin mobile and any of their services or affiliations if i cant trust a company to get internet installed there is no way i would trust getting on a plane operated by virgin,Bad

1574,my contract is due to expire in a few days time so i rang your upgrades department to negotiate a deal for a samsung galaxy s g a vodafone advisor offered me a deal of something in the region of total cost for a month unlimited max contract and i confirmed that i was happy with this deal your advisor begins reading out the terms and conditions of the deal and i hear him say that the monthly cost will be per month and i immediately realise that this will be a much higher price than the one he had originally advertised me and when i questioned it he came back with some rubbish that its a month contract and then the final months will become sim only which sounded very suspect to me he then proceeded to put me on hold and whilst i was on hold with him my phones battery died and therefore the call had ended upon switching my device back on i get a voicemail and emails confirming that my order had been confirmed and processed despite never actually confirming an order and discussing any payment details and thus payment would be coming out of my account already linked with you ive then had to ring your cancellations department to explain the situation to them and cancel my order they have told me that i wont be receiving an email confirming that my order has been cancelled so i guess its just a case of fingers crossed for me now that no money will be taken from my very disappointing that you have treated a loyal customer like this who has never had any issues whatsoever in the past and it looks like i will now be forced to change network im now getting emails from dpd saying my package will be arriving tomorrow this is despite speaking to another advisor regarding cancellation i cant believe this this is such terrible customer yes i have done that but your twitter and facebook teams arent interested in getting back to me,Bad

1578,this package offered as three months trial period and there was a problem setting up our broadband and the rest of the services i called virgin media on august to enquire about the end date for this months trial period as i received an email from virgin on july asking for feedback about your services within first month i thought the service has gone live on june therefore in this conversation i asked whether the service went live on june and this was confirmed by the customer service representative i then called on september and requested for cancellation of this contract and i was told by a customer services representative that i need to speak to a member of national homebuilders team to cancel this service the call was transferred to this department and after being around minutes on the line an automated message played stating that due to technical issues my call will not be answered today and i will be contacted with this regard since i was given september as a final day of our three months trial period i then contacted virgin on september to clarify that i do not want to proceed with this broadband and i would like it to be cancelled i talked to a customer services representative in the evening of september and to my surprise i was told that this could now be cancelled by a member of customer services department although i was told that this only can be dealt with by national home builders team i was then told that our cancellation deadline was september and not september and therefore we are liable to cancellation charges and this service only can be cancelled with a day notice i requested for our conversation on august to be listened to confirm what i was told but david the representative refused to do this and stated that i have called late and i am liable for the cancellation charges,Bad

1580,my contract finished with virgin th april and they are still sending me monthly bills and charging my account with the services despite them a acknowledging my account has been closed and sent me a returns label to return kit this company have to be the worst company ive ever dealt with vile disgusting customer service its been the worst service ive ever received they break all the rules of true customer service excellence use them at your own risk if you do make sure you record every call you make with them nothing gets actioned when the phone goes down and no one really hayley please can i ask you not to comment on my review with a generic email response which consists of no real content or empathy your complaints link when it works online is useless i dont know why i have raised complaints because to date ive had no response to any of them ive got many of your c reference numbers which have just gone into your big black virgin hole i can assure you you dont care about your customers not all of them because youve treated me so bad its even reduced me to tears and over the years ive started with anxiety every time i have to speak to virgin thats the result of years of bad customer service even a member of virgin staff with me on the phone his feedback was virgin are all about getting new business they dont care about existing customers and yes i can vouch for that the way you have treated me and still treating me and im not even a virgin customer anymore is to me why youd made it so difficult for me to change my package to internet only over years why youve constantly told me its no cheaper yet ive spoken to several of my neighbours who just have the internet and they pay much less than i was on a tv package youve constantly lied to me explain to me why at the beginning of and the end of my contract you stopped me negotiating a new contract making me pay even higher costs i was told to ring back the following month my contract had finished a member of virgin said to me even i cant speak to my contracts team this is just a few examples of many disgusting customer service experiences virgin need to be investigate by the government now and we need more fibre to door providers it is very clear to me that you have a dominant position in your sector hence why you feel you can treat your customers the way you do,Bad
1581,why would you threaten my brother to pay back so much when his contract has ended and then says his credit will be affected its absolutely disgusting you say your the best provider youre having a laugh ee is the worst provider out of all of them and i wouldnt recommend the loyalty he has gave you and it has to be all about profit with you dont go to ee be better off elsewhere,Bad
1582,i have been with virgin media for both tv and broadband for much of the last broadband service was patchy at best til a recent upgraded hub improved things tv box was originally good but has deteriorated steadily and even an upgrade has not improved the real problem is the customer service all of the issues mentioned above have been near on impossible to resolve as getting through to anyone is a mission i wish on nobody and if you do finally get through the chances of achieving a result are such im resorting to attracting their attention by this negative but honest review and ultimately cancelling the direct debit as lack of payment is always more attention grabbing than complaining,Bad
1583,very bad abroad and you pay the worst deal out of all companies and it has really bad reception everywhere is constantly searching for network dreadful,Bad
1584,the worst company ive ever dealt with and considering ive been a customer for years i would expect a little morein a nutshell ive been trapped into paying more months of line rental on a line asked to be put to payg times i even went into a store today and called their cs number with the shop guy there promised this time it would go through but a credit be given as their has never been a service request on their system despite the extensive notes of all the times ive called over the last months asking for the downgrade he said it was protocol and his hands were was all this is got sold fibre and on the sales call the woman failed to tell me about the charge for failed to downgrade my line and mis sold me by renewing my mobile agreement without my my calls to complain ive been promised numerous call backs with no actual call back ive been told a cannot make a formal complaint over the phone and laughed at down the phone by a manager and the advisors in the background as i suffer with advice would be to leave when you can and to never enter into another contract with this shambolic unprofessional and rude company who dont know their rears from their,Bad

1586,we have been set up with broadband with bt since last march and have had ongoing issues since the start the broadband was not set up to the correct address which we then requested this to be updated times but it was also set up as a residential account as opposed to business its been a total nightmare with incredibly weak and inconsistent connection after having more then i care to count and possibly technicians come and take a look at our connectivity issues we are still without resolution months on from raising this issue being left with totally inadequate internet making it impossible to effectively run the business this has been the worst experience and the lack of customer support has been beyond disappointing,Bad
1587,phoned the tech service as i was having weak signal with my mobile data guy on phone told me to go into settings and make some alterations and he will then call me straight back no call back and the alterations made my phone alot worse why tell customers you will call them straight back and then you dont shocking service,Bad

1595,automation ai call it what you will but virgin media have jumped wholesale into automated texts to the point where i have received over ten messages all the saying the same thing its just incessant rubbish i dont even need and then i get emails asking how they did lol do not go to virgin they are out of touch and think we should just go along with every new technological modification we dont have to accept this nonsensical lack of customer service and their internet products are woeful at best,Bad

1618,the worst customer services you will get from virgin media speaking to philippine call centre was a nightmare some pretend they couldnt hear you and cut the line they promise to call back and never do they asked for customers passwords memory answers and all sorts when questioned dont worry i wont remember your password what kind of call centre that asks customers for their passwords then memory questions and lied so many times and they get agitated when challenged bottom line is dont waste your time with this mobile service supplier cancel and get out now before it is too late my sim never arrived and still not resolved i have wasted so many hours trying to sort this and have now gone with another provider think i have had a lucky escape,Bad
1619,pretty much the worse option i could have chosen when going for a good internet provider customer has literally no rights and theres no flexibility whatsoever the wifi router doesnt go as far as meters away from it and i struggle to use it when on the terrace if i want to move home and they are not covering the are where i am moving i have to pay penalty fee and they give me no other options if i want to transfer the contract to the person who moves to the current address i cant as they have to have lived there for at least months if i want to move it to an area where they do have coverage i have to resign the contract for another months which i will not even if they were the only internet providers on the planet very difficult to get a complaint sorted there is no way to submit it online you are supposed to be a company it can only be submitted via phone which one couldnt have proof that it was submitted and what was said or done or written which takes ages to reach them and not to mention to even look at it the virgin mobile is terrible bad experience but less hassle there as i just didnt use the service and that was it the department that deals with complaints seem to be the only competent and responsive department had one of the virgin mobile issues sorted right away,Bad

1621,back in june i combined my separate broadband and mobile contracts into a bundle and since then im being charged twice for the same service i have contacted customer service times so far including raising a formal complaint and their response is you will keep being billed twice beyond a joke,Bad

1629,my box is failing to record rang talk talk was on the phone for an hour and was asked a hundred questions only wanted a new box got no where,Bad

1641,the online system is awful the constantly fails to go into the data plan leaving me to do it manually each time and in the first few times i wasnt able to notice as i didnt expect it to constantly fail which leads to the service eating away at my credit which denies me to add to my data plan,Bad

1652,well here i am back again with another review of here it is warts and all i put a review up on here previously explaining that i had been a bt customer for approximately years and that during that time both the technical side and the levels of customer service had always been woefully bad the tech kit was and still is second rate the promised absolutely free this will definitely fix it for you upgrades are second or third generation unless you are prepared to sign up for another months contract and the level of customer service is way below that following my review bt responded and asked me to reach out to them on facebook point to note what if i am not on facebook notwithstanding that i did reach out the employee i spoke to said she had run tests and there was nothing they could do well that was fairly not true because another employee contacted me and said she could send out a newer for newer read not yet quite obsolete second or third generation hub and that might fix it and it would be free of it wasnt because without telling me bt applied an activation fee of just under if i hadnt checked my bill i wouldnt have known when challenged bt said that their system automatically applies the charge but that when customers the charge is automatically removed well thats absolutely fine i do wonder just how many bt have pulled in over the years from customers unwittingly trusting them when bt tell them something is free anyway the hub that was sent out didnt fix the problem i wasnt surprised because it was just history repeating yet another monkey sorry highly trained engineer will be out soon to out the usual corporate lines and tell me that either it is my fault my houses fault or that there is nothing wrong now i wont bore you with my tales of woe over the last years but i will draw your attention to a few points the scores on this site for bt are absolutely shocking today of reviewers scored bt as either or and most scored them as because they couldnt score them a if you were going into a car showroom to buy a new car and there was a sign outside the doors saying of our customers rate us as poor or terrible would you be tempted to buy one of their cars if you did and it was unreliable would you take it back and upgrade it for a later model and pay even more for yet another god awful car well i did the same sort of thing with bt for years how dumb am i the reviews clearly show that the bt attitude is well we have a massive share of the market so why should we care if our service is rubbish clearly they dont if they did they would address the issues instead of offering a second rate service as some form of compensation from what i can see the bt business model is designed to minimise costs through denying free upgrades of latest generation technology to long suffering customers and to keep you locked in to contracts so that you will not go elsewhere how many times have you heard that they will give you a free last time a month ago they promised me free fibre into my house a free gucci hub new generation technology that would be bound to sort out all my issues and the latest free bt tv box all free despite what they had said about it being free that was not the case i had to commit to another month contract but what about the previous years when i had paid for a promised level of service that i didnt get compensation time i didnt fall for it because i had heard this sales pitch so many times before from my experience bt have zero interest in providing decent levels of service they promise the earth and fail every time then try to tie you into a further contract by promising to give you what they should already be giving take my advice read the reviews i fell for their sales pitches for years more fool methe guy that fronts this organisation according to the cwu website june is bt ceo philip jansen on their site they claim his million remuneration package is no less than times the average pay levels in bt and you want to keep him in a job brand loyalty and bt are history here i gave them years what a cabbage how many chances will you give this guys organisation to provide you with god awful levels of service,Bad

1658,i came to the end of a contract and had a house move at the same time when i moved house they instantly started a new contract although it had been explained that my existing contract and remaining duration contract duration would carry over i then received a bill for where previously it had been i knew the contract was coming to an end and i would automatically be charged a higher rate but was told by virgin that i should ring back hours after the installation in my new property to discuss new contract offers i rang twice over days and both times i was told to ring back later as my new address had yet to be registered i rang back a third time and the call dropped i then used their online messenger service and the messenger dropped when transferred to the contracts department by this time my existing contract came to an end and i was automatically charged double the contractual fee this was simply due to the inadequacies of their customer service team as their failure to answer my my calls lead to my existing contract rang back and eventually got through i was told that there is nothing they could do about the one month bill of but i could extend my previous contract of for another months if i didnt extend they would cancel my broadband which in the middle of a pandemic in which i am working from i couldnt do so i signed up for another months they backed me into a corner created by their own inadequate customer service and then took an additional thanks for nothing,Bad
1659,disgusting service and a total ripoff was told when i first started with virgin media that for the best deals i had to have phone tv broadband even though i said i had no need or use for the tv box or landline but was forced to accept them to get the best prices then at the end of my contract they hit me with a bill for the month usual bill was so called them up to ask why my bill is suddenly so expensive just to be told that my contract had ended and all discounts removed then to be offered another deal when i said im not happy to be paying just for the use of the broadband because i dont use the other services forced upon me and i hadnt even been getting the speeds promised so they then offered me a broadband only offer at a cheaper price than my original monthly price so why was i not offered this years ago when i said i had no interest in a tv box or landline an absolute con just to make more money and finally i just received a big phone bill because to call up virgin from my mobile as i dont actually own a landline phone which ive been paying for to find out why my bill is so high and being put on hold for minutes trying to get through then again to call up to cancel any future services from virgin and never being told that its a premium rate number ive now got another to pay for the call a total rip off im going to bt,Bad

1663,i have regrettably stayed with virgin media for my broadband service for years in the se area throughout these years i have had intermittent issues with service and gone through around routers however in the last few months i have been having frequent problems including solid days without any broadband my main complaint is how the company deal with these issues usually claiming there is a fault with the router or that internet maybe slow or intermittent even during the period of absolutely no service for days a quick internet search revealed hoards of people in my area and in fact across the country having similar issues yet when i used the check service status function no issues were reported clearly they have some large scale problems to work through not only was there clearly a huge problem but virgin media didnt seem to be able to identify the problem which is evidently affecting a huge number of customers upon complaining i was refunded for the period of bad service but they were unable read unwilling to give me compensation on top of this to make up for the huge inconvenience and extra mobile costs incurred as a result of shoddy servicei have now terminated my contract and will be actively advising friends to look elsewhere for broadband service,Bad

1673,i have finally had it up to here with them two years ago i took out a month contract on a samsung galaxy sii everything was great and i had no problems with them got a great deal at per month as with most phone companies you are given an option to upgrade you could upgrade early but this would cost you and the deals you were offered were pretty awful i decided to wait until my full upgrade date to get a decent deal on a full upgrade and hopefully keep my contract instead when the date arrived all the great deals i was promised were suddenly gone and i was left with their incredibly expensive refresh tariff the cheapest deal i could get was a month twice was i was already paying i decided to contact o through their customer support and explained to them my issue the customer service advisor on the other end then proceeded to read of the same nonsense deals as above acting like they had done me a favour and pulled some strings in the end i had to transfer to a sim only day rolling contract on my current phone which barely works any more while i figured out what to do this week i decided to take action and shop around a bit since o clearly didnt want my business i found a brilliant deal with ee gb of data unlimited texts and minutes and a free samsung galaxy note for per month i placed my order and today my phone arrived and was set up and working within minutes because i use my phone for business i wanted to keep the same number so i got in touch with o to obtain my port authorisation code or pac this is where things got very strange not in a good way i explained what i needed and i was eventually passed to the correct department to handle the case i then had to explain everything again to the new person after again asking for my pac i was asked what deal i had been offered to make me leave o i explained about the deal i had got with ee and the cs advisor said she would see if they could match the deal out of pure curiosity i decided to let her try mainly because i wanted to see if they suddenly had a deal that they were refusing to give before she came back with a deal with unlimited texts and minutes just like ees deal but only mb of data for a month and said that it was the best deal they had as i was writing a response to this to say thanks but no thanks and to please have my pac she came out with some things that left me in disbelief she told me that over the past two months my average data usage had been mb this was because since i had switched to a rolling contract my mobile data had failed to work properly they had done nothing to fix that but that is another issue she then said that mb was more than enough for me and that gb was a waste how dare they tell me what i do or do not want i then made the logical point in return by pointing out that even if gb was more than i would use in a month why on earth would i take a deal that would cost me more each month to have x less data it would make no sense whatsoever i then asked once again for my pac after feeling somewhat insulted by their condescending remarks and need to tell me what i do or do not need or want as if i am some kind of idiot once again my request for a pac was ignored and i was then told in somewhat broken english once again that you dont need so much of data mb ois more than enough followed by being told that they are worth more each month because they are the number service provider and i could trust them o think i should pay an extra over the course of my contract for a worse deal simply for the privilege of being with o ive never heard such arrogance after these ridiculous remarks i asked for my pac again and this time i was begrudgingly given one after only minutes for something that should have taken at the most i am very glad to be off of this terrible network but their rude arrogant and downright condescending customer service has left me with a terrible taste in my mouth thankfully i requested a transcript of my chat with their customer service otherwise im not sure i would believe this was real avoid like the plague,Bad

1702,have been fighting with virgin media for months ever since the day of installation now going to take my complaint to as i have taken it as far as i can with virgin nowi was the package and was led to believe i was going to get something i didnt was then convinced to pay extra to add it on were in a rush did not install properly and left a horrendous mess they broke my daughters toy rocket and moved things without putting them back we rang right away to complain only to get a very rude abusive phone call an hour later from the guy who came to install it asking what my fing problem manager came out took photos of the damage the same day promised hed sort out our carpet to be cleaned then conveniently lost the pictures when it came to resolving the finally comes out again months later after not turning up twice and reports back that i am a liar and that there is nothing wrong with my home or carpets we cleaned our carpet as best we would we want to leave our home filthy whilst they decide whether to do anything about the damage or have offered no further help or recompense just insinuating that we are the liars and not their area manager we got credited back just one months line rental and that was because they had poorly installed the first time and it needed broadband is unreliable and they try to deny this by saying they only count a crash if the box has to be reset it usually resolves itself after and dont expect to get anywhere near the speed you pay for on speed tests we were getting way below the speed promised so i argued to get the price adjusted to the speed provided this was done like its always buffering but when i complained about it i was told it must be my equipment oh three month old top spec laptop must be the problem even though it works beautifully on my parents and best mates broadband connections i have ms and the stress of dealing with virgin in the past months has helped cause two relapses one major involving my spinal cord we were really looking forward to having virgin media installed but now regret it terribly and just want to leave except we cant because they are wanting to charge us for the privilege even though they are in breach of contract for not keeping up their side of the terms and conditions lets hope decide on our favour,Bad
1703,literally the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life not only do you have to press the majority of the wrong options to speak to somebody once a human is available they are in a very far away land and cant assist disgraceful company ofcom must me inundated with major complaints associated with this farce of a company,Bad
1704,on the th of every month my plan resets so i should get free calls free texts and gb of data however for some reason the data never resets itself and i then get charged for exceeding my data then have to phone email and chase vodafone to get a refund often unsuccessfully,Bad
1705,one star because trustpilot dont go any lower i wanted to put no are by far the most incompetent company i have ever had dealings talktalk contract ends or april i got on to talktalk march spoke to a talktalk rep about my monthly rate that has gone up to they offered to keep it at pm for a further months and repay from the overcharge they said they would confirm this within the next days talktalk had offered this further months at because i said due to the talktalk monthly payment doubling i was thinking of moving to recorded the conversation with the talktalk rep so there cant be any disputes the telephone recorder connector can be plugged into any phone and you can record phone calls to any recorder i prefer the sanyo with the minute micro tapes to to talktalk s incompetence it looks like ill be a customer soon,Bad
1706,i ordered broadband through sky when we moved house months said when will i get broadband who knows force you to have full fibre if its available but seemingly wont give it to you there are no alternatives other than to wait we also have no phone line to rely on if the mobile network isnt working neither nor sky seem to care have the monopoly on the cables so theres nowhere else to go for anyone else experiencing this you can purchase a mifi device on a temporary basis,Bad
1707,reel you in with promise of package discount when you say you are going to cancel then deny it as far as i am concerned i was mis sold the contract for remainder of my my use of virgin and was conned into staying with them although some discount is still in place it is still above what i was told an can afford can not wait until dec when my contract finishes so i will be free of vm,Bad
1708,the vodafone responses to the other reviews just prove the point they dont engage and just refer to somewhere else if you go to the shop the tell you to get online if you go online they tell you to go to the shop and if you call them there is usually at least a min wait and the tell you to call of the time i have called them they havent actually dealt with the problem in the end but always send a poor ratings on the internet should give them enough feedback unless they dont read them,Bad
1709,wish i could give a because thats what they rude unprofessional and lazy bunch kept transferring me from one end to another nobody want to work like this people stressed the hell out of my life with lies and unfulfilled promises they are terrible take it from me glad i am not using them anymore terrible experience cant and wont ever recommend not even to an,Bad
1710,i decided to switch over to virgin media for my telephone internet and tv and it was the worst mistake i had problems right from the start they cancelled connection appointments then showed up to connect but didnt have the correct tools then a different team had to be called in because of the height despite me telling them that i was on the nd floor beforehand then another team had to come because the special heights team couldnt fit the interior fittings etc etc that went on for about months once it was finally connected the overcharging started i was charged for services i didnt order or receive i spent hours on the telephone trying to explain what i had ordered and to try to put it right it was never sorted out and it continued throughout my time with them then i found out that my bt line was never cancelled by virgin as was agreed and confirmed in writing and was subsequently charged by bt for line usage for months again hours on the telephone trying to some help etc etc finally after months of nonsense i decided to cancel my contract again spending hours on the telephone only to be told that id have to buy my way out of my contract so despite virgin consistently breaking our contract throughout my time with them i was now having to pay my way out ha i finally agreed to paying a sum and washed my hands of them or so i though several months later my old neighbor i had moved by this time contacted me to say that hed been receiving threatening letters from a debt collection agency regarding my outstanding virgin bill typical virgin not only messed up again with my account they even got my address wrong by this point i was enraged and completely i wrote to the ceo of virgin explaining the situation and the complete lack of customer service id received and i actually got a response the account has now been cleared and hopefully that will be the end of virgin though i dont hold my breath i will never use virgin media again,Bad
1711,dont even deserve star customer service as a lot to be desired trying to cancel an account that has not been activated by me they tell me i have to phone and deactivate it how can this be in the mean time time i am informed i owe monies until i pay i will not be deactivated but i am not activated going round in circles customer care has a lot to be desired,Bad

1714,absolutely crap took them days to figure out that their broadband isnt working after telling us to reset the router for minutes they kept on avoiding the problem saying to ring back their foreign customer service has no idea what theyre doing how is this business still operating,Bad
1715,so ive not had internet since pm last night its now pm and the internet has just came on after messing around with it myself in between these times i phoned orange times i made it past the automated talker and input my details and the phone was picked up was i greeted with a friendly customer service line from a helpful employee no was i greeted with anything no i heard keys typing and staff talking in the background but no answer second time exactly the same rd time someone answers and proceeds to ask me for my mobile number before asking me my query he then corrected himself and asked for my landline before asking me for the password i notified him that my dad was at work and he told me i could phone up ive never contacted them before so i dont know what password it is he says in an angry tone we need your password or i cant help you i tell him i dont know what password he wants i have different combinations but i dont know what one he wants i give him one and he shouts thats not the password if you dont know the password charlie must phone up himself i said ive spoke with charlie hes told me to sort this before he gets home look at the bottom of the router what is the username its admin no the username his tone is unacceptable and i reply in kind the username is admin after giving him the correct combination on the rd attempt my fault but his tone was unacceptable and totally uncalled for i proceed to the next step which is the page for the router he tells me to reset the router i tell him ive already logged in and done it times previously this morning as well as a factory reset he tells me to do it again i do it and it funnily enough doesnt work another minutes onto the bill as a total waste he gives me serveral options to fix none of them work he tells me he needs my mobile number i enquire why and he just says if you want me to help you give me your mobile number i said no tell me why you need it first he explains that he needs to do a check on my landline and cant do it whilst im on the phone he wants me to phone him on his extension on my mobile at probably about a minute and communicate there i tell him not to bother and he hangs up on me service was solved too long for no progress absolute joke,Bad
1716,the irony that virgin media is owned by a company called liberty which is what they are taking raising bills by because they simply can although just because you can doesnt mean you should its simply greed you obviously have no social conscience well lets test your business model when i cancel my contract because of your greed you will receive of nothing well done greed doesnt expected ive received a pre scripted non personal response from a greedy corporate organisation if you cared you would give a personal response well done again,Bad

1740,everything everywhere is a laughable company they spend an excessive amount of money on their advertising yet fail to deliver even of what they claim the customer service advisers seem to be truly reflective of the company they are employed by refusing to answer questions deemed by themselves to be outside of their department reminiscent of their signal was duped into a month contract entirely my fault where the sales advisor chose me the best package of an iphone c with g internet that is never available minutes texts and a staggering mb of data how a sales adviser could ever think this would be sufficent i do not know surprisingly i used all my data in the first three days three days this amazing package has cost me a month luckily a couple of months into it i was complaining about it all and a friend of a friend worked in a phone shop and bumped my package up so for the same price i was now getting unlimited minutes and unlimited texts with gb of data how this works i do not know but its surely a scam why wasnt i offered the best package possible in the first place especially if the signal was going to disappear as soon as i enter my property and the g internet would be unavailable with not g replacing it but its even slower and unconscious cousin e rude telephone also fail to record notes efficiently so when you give your one months notice to leave yes apparently after being tied down for months you still cant escape and with such ignorant telesales advisers who fail to record your request to leave could you tell i wouldnt be recommending them but seriously though dont bother they will frustrate you every time you require help,Bad
1741,absolute rubbish company customer service sucks no one listens to you they outsource the job to overseas who sound like robots when they do call back no two departments keep notes so they have no clue what your issue is you are forced to repeat over and over my contract expired instead of writing giving me options a person starts calling you all hours of the day no arranged time and no telling you what options or costs are open to you my feed jumped im fed up and ready to jump ship im also laughing because they sent me this link to place a review about my experience hoping i suppose for a positive response,Bad

1743,my feedback will be honest and non offensive but not sure you will listen i have been a customer for many many years in fact since whom i worked for put the telephone and cable tv lines in south london over years ago i actually object to being excluded from all your good broadband offers just because i am a longstanding and loyal customer of many years and not a newbie you will see i do not use my landline phone even though i have to pay for it i feel i am probably not the only customer who feels excluded thank you linda,Bad
1744,we long term customers of virgin media and paying per month for tv telephone and broadband over the years we have seen prices go very high up but services go down tv we lost hum euro and ary no replacement pakistani channels given so my elderly parents whos origin is pakistani miss out we have complained about this but virgin media still not catering for british pakistani communities in the uk broadband we dont get wifi in all our rooms even after a number of complaints and call outs it continues to be poor hope things start to improve because what we getting so far is not worth what we paying,Bad

1748,absolutely appalling i wanted to give notice of cancellation after being a virgin customer for over twenty years via then and it has been an atrocious experience it took minutes to get through was interrogated as to my reasons told horror stories about the perils of other providers and offered a better deal which was to add a sports package and pay more then finally put through to the disconnections department only to be hung up on this rigmarole was repeated four times before i finally managed to give notice by this point i was hysterical with laughter at the farce and point blank refused to enter into any discussion other than i am leaving please make this happen diabolical,Bad
1749,my engineer was supposed to arrive between and he arrived after pm i had to call the office several times to check whats going on or if hes even going to show up every time i just got a random time like he will be there is half an hour that seemed like they just made it up they could have let me know what was going on without me having to call so many times the engineer once he arrived was and helpful his name was working in acton town area perhaps worst of all the problem was that virgins subcontractor kellys just disconnected our internet cutting the cable under the ground for no reason we have seen their van outside our house doing works the same time the signal disappeared we waited days without internet for it to be connected back again and it was extremely difficult to find on the website where to book an appointment,Bad

1752,vodafone is the worst company i have ever signed up for mobile services with if you notice here they dont even reply to comments which shows how much they care about their reputation i signed up for a dongle for month in december i was very specific when i was signing up telling the sales stuff that i only needed the account for month i cancelled the following day as they advised a bit later i decided to check the balance went to the shop where i signed up called customer services spend about an hour on the phone being passed on from one advisor to another they are remarkably slow at understanding the issue and i had to explain it again and again every time i was passed on i asked them to make sure that my account was cancelled on january as requested they promised that it would be i also asked for the balance on the account since i could not create an online account without having a mobile phone it was a dongle because signing up meant i needed to receive a pin which my laptop couldnt receive so i was stuck customer services could not tell me how much data id spent when i called vodafone early in january i found out that the account was still active after january and that i owed them having only allocated per month this is considering that i purchased extra data i went to the shop i signed the contract with countless times spoke to countless advisors wrote letters to vodafone only for the saga to continue i spoke to customer services again telling them that i could not check the used data online since i was unable to open an online account and the customer services would not tell me how much id used eventually on my latest visit the sales person who signed me up took pity on me and spoke to vodafone customer services himself they told him that the account had been cancelled and that the extra charges would be refunded i have just received emails from vodafone to say that they had removed the limits for using the service abroad and for adult sites this means that the account is still active i could not believe it i am now going to write to ofcom and everywhere i can to warn people to never join vodafone ever the experience i am having with them is a nightmare which doesnt seem to have an end in sight,Bad

1773,i even think one star is too good for o customer service all i can say is that the people you speak to always come across initially as nothing more than accommodating and friendly but their real speciality is passing you off or putting you on hold for what seems like an eternity or the phone will go dead one member of staff after stating that i thought his colleague was trying to get rid of actually agreed with me i have also received texts to say someone will ring me within minutes this has never happened when i have phoned in yet again they always seem to say someone has tried to contact you i doubt that o as my phone is with me constantly and i have never received a peep out of you i have also complained about a change of name form that i put in on th january along with a copy of my marriage certificate which has still never received any attention to date and this has now left me unable to request an upgrade because my account is still held in my previous surname despite numerous attempts to solve this i have requested to speak to a manager on two occasions but again you just get passed off or put on hold i also made the mistake of purchasing a phone cover for the new samsung galaxy s edge phone which i had hoped to upgrade to but unfortunately i did not like it so returned it with proof of purchase and was told i would receive a refund on this has never materialised i did receive an email to ask me to call customer service to provide them with my card details for them to refund the cost alas i just get put on hold yet again now withholding customers money after goods have been returned and received supporting this with an email to confirm receipt is totally unacceptable especially when you call to speak to customer services and then they put you on hold again to transfer you to the cash management team who do not answer the phone for you to arrange a this is theft nobody knows anything nobody wants to help or resolve issues it seems they only appear to be interested in the commission they get for clinching new contract i will be taking this further to recover my money i have been with o for many years now but i just want to leave disappointing,Bad

1787,i wish i could give zero stars we have signed our fibre broadband contract last year and we never got nowhere near the guaranteed speed we were very busy so did not get in touch with talktalk this year we were very naive and signed another year contract with talktalk and once again the speed is very low i have been in touch with talktalk for the past four months and the issue still has not been resolved i had to call talktalk multiple times each time i have to explain from start what is the problem it is absolutely shocking that the customer service do not even ready their own notes on the system when we finally had the engineer booked in first time he did not even arrive second time the engineer came measured the speed and said it is a little bit lower than the guaranteed but it should be still ok to watch movies and browse the internet i do not think i am being unreasonable when complaining about the speed though our minimum guaranteed speed is mbps download and the highest we have ever reached is mbps our issue has not been resolved yet and i cannot wait for my contract to end and to move to a different provider,Bad
1788,i really wonder how someone can produce such a pathetic i wish i could have gone for any other isp i would not have been so disappointed i am sure i am begging all my friends now not to be a victim of this crap talktalk,Bad

1803,must have spoken to at least vodafone customer service personnel over the past month regarding my bill and upgrade which they totally messed up times in a row each one not only had a completely different to my query but each one also actually didnt really know anything at all if cancelling my contract with vodafone wasnt so complicated time wasting and costly i would cancel my contract with them in a heartbeat,Bad
1804,i am months broadband ee contract and i still trying to use my broadband i need to call every single day to call centre to use i do not recommend to anyone,Bad
1805,vodafone might be the absolute worst organization to ever exist in fact if the nazis had ever run a mobile network i would be pretty sure this is how i they would have made it,Bad

1807,i had lots of issues with broadband i couldnt get my guaranteed speed of but instead i was only getting after lots of phone calls with customer service and technician visits i was able to cancel my contract i was very surprised when i got my final bill for due to early disconnection so ive reported them to ofcom who regulates them case is ongoing at the minute do not use talk talk as they cant keep promise and they treat whats written on contract as nothing,Bad
1808,wish i could give them minus stars worst company ever they continue to steal money from me even though they havent been providing the agreed upon services to me for months tried several times speaking to them on the phone and everytime i call they say they have no notes about my complaints i recently changed to a new provider and they called me asking me to stay said they can magically see ive made a few complaints offered me a deal to stay then didnt deliver on it now im with my new provider they are still billing me do not use this company awful customer,Bad
1809,had a really upsetting experience with talktalk gave weeks notice of us moving house so we could schedule in our internet and we are now week late on we are a house of young professionals all working from home now using our g and being charged have reached out to talktalk times for an escalation and have received no and annoyingly no internet really at a loss of what to do next as customer service reps little help to us at this point,Bad
1810,i was a broadband contract on the premise that upgrading to a more expensive contract meant no disconnection charges when we move abroad when it came to moving vodafone hits us with a hefty disconnection charge because surprise were moving abroad last year a customer service rep called me about my broadband specifically to upsell me onto their pro knew we would be moving abroad in and when i raised this he said that there arent any cancellation fees if we move to an area thats not supported by vodafone which implies there wouldnt be a disconnection i was to a more expensive contract despite not needing it on the premise that we wouldnt be hit with a hefty disconnection charge when we move i even took down notes dated sept am because i was wary of the disconnection forward to today after i give notice that we are moving abroad vodafone hits me with a disconnection charge and says that the charge is only waived if we move to somewhere within the uk that isnt covered by vodafone something which was omitted from my conversation with the rep when i contact vodafone they say they cant find a record of our phone kind of shady sales technique is shameful i was promised one thing on the phone with a rep who wanted to upsell me a broadband contract without telling me the full story on the disconnection crazier no one can tell me how the disconnection charge is calculated so i just have to accept there is a it leaves a bad taste in the mouth after being a vodafone customer for more than years,Bad
1811,absolutely disaster customer service wasted about hour answering unrelated question to technical faults just to send one technician to check your line thats a total waste of time and makes you frustrated better switch to another service,Bad
1812,i advise people to dont do sim its rubbish they do deal for g when you finish your g start to be slow after midnight good speed that after midnight i have very poor internet doesnt work,Bad
1813,their customer service is absolutely shocking ive been trying to cancel my contract because we moving house and this is proving to be an impossible task there is no way to perform this task online one has to call a number which is the worst experience ive had in a long been through their website and it sends you to the phone number which i called yesterday for mins and they hung up on me i then called again this morning and after being shifted between agents and holding for i was cut off again and in that time i was forced to listen to advertising on how wonderful they are,Bad
1814,please find an alternative broadband provider to cant comprehend how companies as large as talktalk and are so inept and been without broadband for days now and they cant manage to book and engineer between them ive spent nearly hours on the phone over the last day and wasted half a day off waiting for an engineer not to turn upi only scored star as isnt urge you not to use talktalk,Bad
1815,the broad band speed is not what is advertised also the virgin engineer that visited told me the line from the exchange to my house needs upgrading but im being ignored from the call centre,Bad
1816,absolutely dreadful customer support avoid this network provider like the plague,Bad
1817,your site sucks how dare you make it impossible to cancel your contract ive been trying for months this is ridiculous,Bad
1818,i regret to award bt with a terrible review thanks to the argumentative attitude of kelly the customer service representative i spoke to today as bt continues to be unable to provide me with the broadband speed service that i have sought over the past years i am changing provider bt has also completely failed to administer my account efficiently to the point where i remain with x active accounts because they have been unable to resolve the matter in all that time they now add insult to injury by charging an exorbitant cancellation fee for moving elsewhere yes i have a bt contract but it does not provide services or administration which are fit for purpose which competitors can provide bt remains heading in the wrong direction in losing customers through its poor service,Bad
1819,ive been with talktalk since the beginning of this year and from the very start of my journey placing my order with customer services ive experienced nothing but problems firstly they cancelled numerous orders for me to then find out they couldnt locate my postcode on their system i was never informed just told to redo order i then had cancelled go live dates due to problems spent hours via telephone and even a webchat which lasted hours where i experienced appalling customer service it took so long for my complaint to be resolved and even then they were reluctant to give any compensation for my lack of and telephone following this my internet box then decided to stop working i had to contact and then wait a week or longer for a new one and then was advised i had to send them back my old one even though they advised it was a fault on their system now ive been advised ive had a which i have been paying for but not receiving again fault which they see on their system advised no compensation would be given and that they had cancelled the boost well thanks a lot take my money but not actually give me the services paid for i queried with them and again they issued complaint and everything takes ages to end my outcome i was refunded month as a good will gesture but thats all they would do just as im about to end the chat im advised they are were adding another charge ridiculous customers are not appreciated nor taken seriously when there is a problem customers pay for a service and should therefore receive the service paid for i am so disappointed in talktalk and am fed up of giving them them the benefit of the doubt for the poor service received they are happy to take your money but when they mess up best believe they will not return it,Bad
1820,their broadband is absolutely shocking the worse i have ever known its slow and intermittent sometimes you cant even get online despite numerous hours on the phone with the technical support updating firmware resetting router etc etc they cannot help us so here we are stuck in a contract with an awful product avoid avoid avoid,Bad
1821,have provided me with great service for years even now with this virus nightmare they answer the phone far quicker than virgin the service with my last issue upgrade knew the system by heart and pointed me at the right place on the website so on the whole no complaints so why only barto get the bosses it took calls the first two the phone system stank even though the connection was good my end could hear the hold music ok when the answered the phone i was only getting every other word if that on the rd call i could hear the guy long enough to sort things out but the call soon degraded to a point where i couldnt hear enough for him to make your phone system bosses you are wasting your staffs time during this difficult period,Bad
1822,the worst customer service i experienced so ask was simple transfer of the contractual phone number to pay as you go despite the fact that on o website it says how easy it is to proceed with such scenario after spending hours in the phone and speaking to different people none of them had any idea about what process they should follow and they asked to call should definitely invest in some coaching and training of their employees and perhaps look into their call stats as well,Bad
1823,all that customer service advisor can do is to take security details and then simply disappear same on phone and chat i cant give even one star for such a service all that i am asking is to provide me with the return address for sending back the hub and cancelling of contract with talktalk two days hours different advisors and still no solution very unprofessional with any willingness to help and pure english,Bad
1824,everything about this company is utterly appalling every single issue takes multiple calls of minute durations to get fixed and were talking many issues here even after ending the contract they keep charging you no one can call back this is just so pathetic that they should be bankrupt already do yourself a favour go to a smaller mvno who knows what theyre doing,Bad
1825,so after the months contract i tried to cancel several times no one available on live chat no one answers the phone so i gave up and just cancelled the direct debit they have never contacted me or post but now passed the debt to a collector who has told me he has no trouble getting through to them and gave me a contact number i am still awaiting someone to answer this call minutes so far of listening to the same woman reassuring me every seconds that they are busy but will answer as soon as possible shocking customer service avoid,Bad
1826,tried to get a new contract sorted and was a bit of a nightmare still not happy people supposed to ring me back and never did spent endless time but didnt get anywhere made a formal complaint but havent heard anything,Bad
1827,the most unreliable broadband constantly drops off signal isnt this supposed to be fibre optic paying for a service we do not receive constantly being harassed to re sign under yet another long term contract refuse to send out engineer or supply a new hub the list goes on,Bad
1828,we were with virgin media for many years and ntl before lately however probably since takeover by liberty global their tactics of fleecing customers at every opportunity became too much i asked them times to move us to current tariff for new customers to save off the bill and get double peak data rate no special promotion deals just the same regular monthly amount a new customer would pay after a while virgin media consistently refused then started ignoring my requests as a result we now switched phone broadband and all our mobiles to talktalk saving over month however the matter does not end there i phoned virgin yesterday to ask about a refund of outstanding balance i had line rental paid for full year and only used months of it and i was told i will be sent by cheque and no further payments are needed so i cancelled vm direct debit only to receive another call from vm in the evening offering me to generously reset my account balance to even though i cancelled my direct debit i refused demanded to see the final bill after which apparently an executive director customer care emailed me a bill charging me for an extra month of broadband and not mentioning the months of line rental to be refunded i am still in the process of disputing this bill will take it to court if necessary but you can see that these people are only after one thing and it isnt good customer experience avoid avoid avoid,Bad
1829,its a shame there isnt a stars have been a vodafone customer for over ten years yesterday i was offered an upgrade on my broadband via the online chat the adviser offered me a deal and i accepted it i thought it was a decent deal then i received an email with a different price i rang today to discuss this and the agent and his manager were less than helpful they disputed that because id been offered this price in writing that it couldnt be upheld the call took an hour to get to speak to a manager even one of the other staff who tried to get me through to this department had issues i would not recommend vodafone to anyone the latest offer is to give me a free cuppa from done vodafone amazing customer service,Bad
1830,our broadband is intermittent and cuts out regularly i have called and complained but if i called everytime it happened i would be on the phone daily and quite frankly i dont have the energy to hold for your call centre as soon as we are able to leave i will be leaving,Bad
1831,service horrible where i lived they did absolutly nothing to help,Bad
1832,i switched from an old pay as you go nokia to a samsung j with o two weeks ago it was a chapter of accidents three times i was promised that my old number would be transferred to the new device within hours and three times it didnt as my change of mind option was about to run out i said i wanted to cancel the contract the operator was very conciliatory and said he would definitely get the number changed within hours it didnt when i tried again today to cancel the contract i was told this was fine but it would cost me because my option had run out money grubbing and mendacious too,Bad
1833,firstly i am stunned that an organisation of this size doesnt respond to and review their trust pilot reviews secondly i am annoyed at myself for not reading these before i signed up i assumed with the brand name virgin theyd be a great company their customer services is shocking if you need to speak to a human choose the leaving virgin media button i have been endlessly simply trying to get an update on when my router will arrive i mean how can a company get that wrong and the call centre i spoke to in india were truly useless,Bad
1834,have issue with been try get help from them but no help from the so called customer service team as still waiting for help i asked from the th april you ask for help wait hours for reply to try see response and hopefully fixed if not then wait further hours then keep wait this modern day you ask company for help you kept waiting for help but keep wait for help my view is better of upgrade thier paper cups and get better string poor on all levels,Bad
1835,i wish id read all the comments about the laughable customer service before i signed up basically i wanted a sim for a tablet which i mainly used on wifi but about once a month in places where no wifi available first time i used it off the wifi network it didnt work swapped sim from my phone and it worked so the tablet was fine and so was an ee sim so i used that but couldnt call and work online simultaneously a month later and im out of wifi range again this time i borrow a friends o sim it works so now i know that the tablet works and the network works only thing which doesnt is the sim solution turn it off and turn it back on again really not surprisingly this doesnt work however in the same message they also wrote i will be more than happy to refund the that you have spent on so far so i asked for a refund only to be told that actually theyve changed their mind then despite me telling them that the sim was useless and i wouldnt be using it any more they automatically renewed my monthly contract and charged me more so in line with all the other complaints technical support is laughable the customer service agents are actually customers being paid for each query they answer therefore any old answer will do provided they get paid so they actually have no interest in solving the problem only in sending you a message there is no address available on the website and no chance of escalating a complaint to somebody who is i think this is the only company who have ever offered me a refund for a faulty product only to turn round and say the equivalent of tough st you cant have it when i ask them to process the refund utterly disgraceful,Bad
1836,of communications monitoring equipment switch out piles of emails calls unstable weak broadband the wifi was always much worse despite the same configuration as apart from my improvements case no in case you try to have this review removed i made every internal improvement possible trying to run a business wifes executive work for international company home schooling the solution a new nd phone line service with another provider super stable fast yet zen wont release me from the last months of my contract youve been warned avoid,Bad
1837,worst company i have ever dealt with customer service is a joke,Bad

1839,robbed us blind as we cancelled the broadband service a year ago due to very poor service and even poorer customer service they continued a free sim contract then charged a month without telling us then sent it to a collection agency for diabolical customer services and shady business practices dont bother with them as there are other providers at the same cost,Bad
1840,truly appalling company i wouldnt even give them one star spent hours on hold listening to false promises and pointless apologies and three weeks later still no broadband shocking customer service how can they get away with it,Bad
1841,since getting an email saying my broadband was being fixed th november the wifi keeps going off every few minutes im paying for a service im not getting and the programs on tv are repeated on half the channels all at the same time so i gave up watching tv a long time ago its a rip off huge expense for poor service,Bad
1842,we left bt a few years ago because their service was so poor but my parents continued to be loyal bt account holders unfortunately i have had to deal with their bereavement processes twice in the past couple of years following their deaths we kept my late mothers account open so that we can access broadband when we have to visit the property to clear it out but bt doesnt seem to understand that they have continued to send billing information to my mothers email and have charged late billing fees as we can no longer have a direct debit as her accounts are frozen and now have put through a price rise because the contract is due for renewal but we cant renew i think you can tell a lot about a company by how they deal with customers in difficult circumstances having dealt with numerous companies to wind up my mothers estate i can honestly say that bt is the worst by a very long way in terms of both process and policies,Bad
1843,i made a contract with you i believe in september or november for an iphone at then it went up to brought my friends and family to join as well the family sister in law did a contract for an iphone pro for and i wanted to match her contract apparently they can do nothing at all as i said earlier i brought friends and family however i will tell them not to renew any contract with you and also i will not come back either already years with you and it is so disappointing,Bad
1844,two hours with customer service and still unable to get them to fix my broadband just asked the same questions seven times saying let me get this sorted for you thank you for replying it took three days before fixed the problem but your customer service has issues caring for customers i had to report issue on line in the end,Bad

1847,having entered the newmarket branch soon after it opened the senior member of staff was engaged with a customer his colleague did not acknowledge us and continued to tap away on her computer and resolutely avoided eye contact another customer arrived and the senior staff member asked his assistant to serve the customers she ignored this the other customer left after another minutes i asked politely for a time frame in which we would be served i want to finish this task its important come back in ten minutes was the response back to her keyboard no intervention from the senior member of staff no apology or further comment the most appalling customer service i have experienced in a long time,Bad

1884,i am writing this two years after i left but it is still relevant from what i of the most frustrating experiences with any business i had it was fine for a time until i paid and internet was okay but had its issues the real nightmare started when i wanted to quit even though my contract ended i called in few times to cancel and leave but they literally laughed at me once the customer service does not even seem to be from uk and it came to the point i had to sent a letter to leave a letter in requesting to leave and i had to to have witness of sending it the letter said otherwise i would make a court case and that made them cancel it for good it took me additional months of payment for broadband did not want anymore,Bad

1889,worst company this company is still afloat mei was told over the phone that after i had my internet installed that within hrs i would have my phone line and tv the response from the technician who installed the internet was to laugh he said minimum week i was enraged then well now im ballistic today they called me informing that due to them not installing it on time they reallocated my phone line spot to someone else and i could no longer have phone line if this wasnt enough of an annoyance i was then informed that opposed to some sort of compensation i would be charged extra just for tv and internet i beg of you please avoid at all costs genuinely a fraudulent useless unreliable company you expect this level of deceit from a man selling things at markets not a multi national corporation like virgin actually perhaps thats giving market salesmen a bad reputation they have a shed of decency,Bad
1890,i am stunned that they can lie and mislead customers and not get more fines i gave day notice period they conveniently had no evidence of this i gave notice again and they terminated contract immediately charging me an early termination fee i insisted they listen to phone recording as wont accept this they lied and said needed days notice to leave broadband and phone you dont its days if moving to another supplier they conveniently did not communicate this they told me they couldnt read my notes out of people i spoke to read notes yes have spoken to people and still not resolved the plan is to exhaust customer and break them down so they give up and pay when not liable so far spent hours on this waiting minutes each time to talk to someone who is skilled at not listening not helping bt have pretended customer services improved forget it worse than ever keep away at all costs just to update you now a week later since writing points above i have moved to sky as they pay up to termination costs from another provider just type sky account credit and all the details are there sky gave me an excellent deal and excellent customer service i would have paid more with another provider as you cannot cut corners with customer care and bt treat their customers with contempt a tip on how to escape from the nightmare they put you through keep on saying contract when you are waiting in the queue you are more likely to get someone in the uk answering anything to do with billing goes to india you may think its a good deal but not when your personal data is insecure abroad as others have reported on this site life is too short to spend in battles with bt they are not worth it i have left bt i am never going back this is the first time i have written a review like this online i dont want others to have to go through weeks and hours of unnecessary hassle save yourselves from being treated very badly go with any other provider steer clear of bt,Bad
1891,absolute rubbish i was given apple tv for free for months with the option to cancel it at anytime i have never used it so i contacted live chat who told me i cant cancel it so i now have another months of my contract paying for something i dont even use i tried contacting their customer support who just kept me waiting and waiting then just hung up on me their app is even worse it keeps telling me i dont have an account with them funny that as they keep taking money out of my bank every month i was also told if the speed dropped i would get money off my next bill well the speed is absolutely dreadful but as they keep telling me the speed through the line to the house and router is acceptable its the speed from the router to my computer that is slow and therefore not their problem so no money off i feel completely ripped off avoid this company if you want a decent service as it fails on all fronts,Bad

1967,after many years with virgin media i called it a day giving the first red flag was signing up for a year contract and having the bill raised within the first months second red flag was virgin ceo sending notice of further bill increases bragging customers would be hard pressed to find a better service on the red flag frequent area outages over the years approx every couple of months reported outages would have virgin arrange for engineers only for the booking to be cancelled without notice fast forward to more recent years and continued intermittent service repeated internet dropouts days without service deductions from bills for lost engineer attended a call out and discovered so he said that the problem existed outside the property and not inside as reported by customer service when he returned he claimed my service wires had been swapped with another address allegedly resolved the service continued to be was told the current router was old and needed updating and one was on order to arrive in the post in two days it never arrived and that was months of the poor broadband virgin added a bill discount that became after they added some random charge to the discount the service remained erratic and i am not a heavy user of the final straw was during the pandemic with further drop outs the customer agent bragging no discounts because the regulator had given providers a free pass because of increased heavy traffic usage of service users this on top of that arrogant ceo letter years of bad service unreliable broadband and ever increasing bills on notice of cancellation for a service i had been out of contract of years out crawled the retention person citing my being a good customer that he could view the length of intermittent broadband provision and offered to send out the specialist engineer to fix that problem and apply a fixed bill reduction guaranteed for a year i smelled manipulation i can have an alleged super specialist engineer to fix what had been substandard broadband for multiple years if and only if i sign up for a new contract at less than currently paid i politely declined days from termination date and i receive a bill not a final bill as that would have been but a continuing bill for the next month ill be glad to be rid of this service that over sells and under performs thats once i sort out the latest it is of concern that a company that sells services on mass that it clearly does not have the capacity to provide when put to the test is reliant on the service being under used ie you are all at work not using what you are paying for when stretched ie pandemic the service collapses into turmoil and requires the regulator to protect them from a mass of future compensation claims,Bad

2003,have been a vodafone customer now for over years without an issue have never really had to deal with their customer support except when ordering a new phone decided to order the new vodafone broadband service ordered on line earlier this year and recieved an email confirmation the day before going live i had not recieved a router so contacted them to make sure everything was ok they had absolutely no record of my order even though i had email confirmation reordered the service again and was given a new live date recieved the modem as discussed and set it up as instructed on the live date came home from work and it had not connected so called vodafone to see when it would was told it had been cancelled by mistake and i would have to reorder was then given another date for connection around weeks later then recieved another router set up router as instructed and internet failed to connect again at no time did vodafone contact me to discuss cancelled orders or anything it just never connected and i had to contact them to find out it wasnt going to happen wrote a letter to vodafone at the end of september to the complaints department no response after over a month so wrote another letter still no response so wrote to the who contacted me straight away not surprisingly vodafone attempted to contact me after the ombudsman got involved i attempted to call them back to discuss and the advisor didnt understand why i was phoning and thought i wanted to upgrade my mobile data and then thought i wanted to order broadband again for the th time after almost shouting to get my point across he said he would put me through to the correct department he instead just put me back through to sales by this point i actually just found it funny the advisor although not a complaint handler did look into my broadband orders turns out that instead of connecting the broadband at my home address in bristol where my account is and where the modem and letters are sent they were attempting to connect it at a random address in wolverhampton on two the advisor was baffled and so was i unfortunately he had no way of putting me directly back through to complaints so i would have had to spend another minutes going through the whole process of speaking to the wrong people and i just dont have the time i wanted to simply discuss the issue with vodafone and see if there was anything they were willing to do to rectify but as they cant even put you through to the correct person with a serious compliant i am instead going to progress this with the bit out of character for me but am also tempted to go to the press as its beyond a joke despite me finding it so funny,Bad

2032,talktalk have taken customer service to a new low just when you thought it couldnt get any worse not even worth one starthe online chat service is extremely limited in what it can do it is evident that the primary purpose is to get in the way of a meaningful conversation with someone that does know what they are talking customer service say they will call within to hours it is utterly unacceptable to wait for the phone to ring once and then hang up calling back two hours later and then hanging up after seconds without actually speaking just adds insult to talktalk how do you sleep at night taking the money and doing nothing for it,Bad

2079,avoid this company like the plague i have has big issues with them since the day i joined them thankfully that acquaintance with them was definitely not sweet like others have mentioned their customer service is appalling only one person who actually proved useful and i think is probably a supervisor but everybody else seems to follow a set of responses that are totally unhelpful and make one think that you the customer are thick i had issues from the start i transferred a number over and that had credit and i wanted to use that to renew my contract each month instead many times they rook the money from my debit card and then one time i tried to do a with my card and they took the money but failed to add it to my balance thankfully with the assistance of my bank i finally got that back i had ordered a new handset after seeing about g signal due to be switched off they claimed all the handsets they were g the one i ordered now no longer sold on their website when it arrived and i checked the imei number it was not g capable it was supposed to be an easy handset to use but i couldnt even get the back off to insert the battery so i arranged for the handset to go back i followed their instructions to the letter even about getting a certificate of collection waste of time as the driver didnt put a label on it claimed it would be done back at base and the place for return on the tracking card was not even related to asda needless to say i havent had a refund for that handset so effectively i am out of pocket as i need a reference number of the order which i dont have and my account is suspended so i cant access i too have switched my contract to a company that is far superior in all aspects especially customer service,Bad
2080,i would rather go back to the dark ages than have broadband provided by recently had an installation which required to connect from the pole across from my home to my pre installation took the two engineers nearly hours to sky coming to connect the ont to my property i was then told that have installed from the pole incorrectly which didnt surprise me in the slightest however ive now got to wait weeks upon weeks for an update as to when theyre coming to fix the cannot fathom how this company is still going as they seemingly cant even do the one job theyre employed to your connection is going to be provided by dont bother because they obviously havent a clue what theyre and dont bother trying to contact them because they couldnt care less if they tried,Bad
2081,shocking service do not use virgin media are showing their true face during the coronavirus crisis back in march i tried to cancel or pause my broadband contract due to financial circumstances i tried calling multiple times having to wait over an hour on the phone every time just for the call to eventually drop i finally got through today and received a shocking service during the call they mention that they want to support the vulnerable but they have shown zero understanding for my situation and are now saying i have to give days notice starting today ignoring all the attempts i made in march absolutely no customer service whatsoever and no support just horrific treatment of their customers dont use them,Bad
2082,on the we received a letter from bt stating that another companys customer had requested a takeover of the phone number at our business address this was due to take place on the as per the instruction in the letter i contacted bt and on this request had been cancelled we were informed that our service would not be broadband went down initially thought it was my equipment but that checked out okay then thought it might be a fault but nothing reported on the bt the next couple of hours i spoke to numerous departments in bt and eventually discovered the broadband service was in the process of being stopped but they would intervene and the service would be back within two hours nothing happened so called bt later in the day eventually spoke to someone called anoop who said he would deal and call back he sent a text message to confirm he was dealing and if i had any queries to reply to the text and he would call back within two hours i waited a couple of hours but still no service so text back no call back from my but still attempted to contact numerous sections of bt mostly getting giving hours of business monday to friday etc and eventually someone in faults who was very understanding and then very helpfully transferred me to another giving hours of business monday to friday etc i eventually spoke to someone else in faults who put me through to vivian who i think had something to do with broadband he gave no excuses saying quite simply that noone in order management would be available to deal with my particular problem until monday spoke to adam in the slamming team who passed my complaint to provisioning someone to call me back within two hours but suggested the broadband should be up again today called bt again this time puneet who now says they will send message to back office for urgent action and bt will get back to me tomorrow tuesday i said this had already happened on friday and i was still waiting and wanted this problem resolved today i asked to speak to one of his managers amit called back now assuring me service will be reconnected tomorrow he explained that the original request to cease the line had been stopped but that the broadband cease wasnt which by now i could have told him he explained that they were waiting for the cease order to run its course and the service would come back up said there was nothing more they could do today i was not happy with this so at spoke to jordan in the slamming team he said it looked as if the cease order was somehow stuck between processes and he would pass me through to order management team to find out what they were doing spoke to someone in this group who put me on hold while he investigated after fifteen minutes on hold i was quite suddenly without announcement reconnected to jordan in the slamming team he had another look and said that it appeared whoever i had just spoken to had not even opened the account to look at it before i was passed on again this time to kumar says that the is due to reconnect tomorrow th so back to square one after call disconnected i received a confirmation text from him and shortly after another confirmation text from both saying i should contact via their texts in the event i should have any other queries still no service i text back to kumar and he responded at told him that the service was still down and he passed me to chris in the slamming team chris then passed me back to jordan who i spoke to yesterday jordan was confused by the fact that they kept referring me back to slamming when it was an order management role jordan has now confirmed that the has been sitting on the system untouched since friday back to order management team nathan now dealing nathan confirms there is a complaint owner dealing with this and he will contact this person and copy in their manager who will call me back by to who i explained the latest action not clear whether or not is the person holding the called me wondering what the current situation was and when i told him he offered to put me through to faults until i stopped him and explained the whole thing again at which he offered to put me back to the slamming team told him rather than muddy the water even more i would allow the complaint holder to do his thing for the next couple of hours and if there is still no service after this time i would call called me back said that the broadband was now ceased but that he had been advised it would take another hrs to reconnect but that he was trying very hard to bring that forward said he would call me later today or tomorrow with an update no response from puneet so text him customer services who dont have the technical expertise to deal so transferred me to sarah in faults she is now looking into the problem confirms provision order has gone through passed to colleague in order provision who is now saying the cease order on the broadband has gone through but it could take another hrs to reinstate has suggested i buy a dongle and bill bt for it he goes away to seek further information comes back minutes later now being told it will take days to reinstate i have asked him to escalate this as it is unacceptable he advised there is a complaint reference already open in the name of puneet is sending me a text and he has also contacted puneet who should be calling me back within hour now puneet called back he is now arranging a call back from a more senior call back from bt yesterday text to call me called me back now checking into why noone called me back yesterday he says he can do nothing until th march because bt wholesale wont deal until then decided to try live chat but they reply to say they only deal with residential connected to business complaints holly is calling wholesale to see why they are not reconnecting the service now connected to shazia she says the cease order is stuck in the system with wholesale and they cant the broadband until the cease order completes i have asked her to go back to wholesale and find out why a bridge case has not been raised as this is not a standard cease request and she has spoken to bt wholesale who cannot take a verbal bridge case so she has sent a bridge case to be escalated to level shazia will now after hrs which is the normal procedure and call me from shazia to state that she has now had to escalate the complaint again via another bridge case and they need to wait another hours before they can do anything is just a couple of pages as this site could not handle any more text now the th march and still no last night after waiting days i got through to bt who said they would look into it and get back to me in hrs bt business i dont think so,Bad

2085,without doubt the worst experience i have ever had with any company genuinely shockingly so for the modern have been forced to go with them as the only supplier of broadband to the property but i have had nothing but unsolvable problems the router supplied is worthless garbage its range barely extends six metres and cannot penetrate plasterboard walls after over hours of trying to resolve this and mostly just getting stuck in loops of bots or people not listening to anything i say and just telling me to keep restarting the router i was convinced to spend yet more money on intelligent wifi this has resolved nothing as the product sent for this is again useless and i am again left with the majority of my house not supplied with have then spent a further two days trying to speak to someone through the webchat that bounces you between bots and people not listening to anything telling you to restart the router endlessly whilst cutting out every half a minute through raising a complaint that tells you they have declared it resolved so it must be resolved which also gives you a number to call if you are unsatisfied with this but that leads to no option to discuss your complaint just another bot that tells you they have fixed the problem and hangs up on through calling that number so persistently that you do eventually speak to someone who seems bemused you have a complaint reference doesnt listen to what your problem is tells you to restart the router and insists the problem is now problem remains entirely unsolved,Bad

2187,the worst ever service i have received many issues incompetent staff and worst of all they fail to supply internet youre told an engineer will be coming to investigate and they fail to turn up and then the company say that one wasnt booked promised phone calls never received tried to file a formal complaint and was assured the manager would call back very shortly which again hasnt happened i have chased my own issue more than the staff yet they are paid to do it are now involved days later im still without any internet and they still have no idea when someone can come and investigate save your money and go elsewhere pay triple the price if you have to if i could put stars i would i am awfully ashamed for them and would expect better service if i paid p a month disgusting,Bad
2188,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
2189,i didnt have wifi for days had to buy bt called multiple times and couldnt get anyone through the worst service ever,Bad
2190,the product is ok when it works but customer service is appalling trying to contact them is a nightmare which you never wake up from i would like to change broadband but no other real option locally i have been waiting since august for a refund for poor wifi even complaints ignored,Bad
2191,not even worth a stari am absolutely discussed with the way they handle my complaint weeks now and still no results taking your money is quick and easy but giving it back is a problem for them and they make you feel like a criminal they took payments from me on day and now i struggle to get it back the people are rude over the phone when they call you and they dont understand half of the things they repeat themselves millions of times talking in circles bad customer experience is an understatement and funny thing is reviews makes you feel better cause you got it of the chest but for them it means nothing they are laughing in our faces i think it is time to email the ceo lets see,Bad
2192,took minutes to tell me to call another number even though i had a reference case number,Bad
2193,no customer contact false information and am expected to pay for nothing i am years of age with hands now covered in bruises setting up my box that wont work wirelessly as i was told by the engineer even though he never looked at it or connected it his hour visit to set everything up was mins to sort broadband all the help you get is webchat or text messages please please bring back customer service,Bad
2194,awful service the internet is intermittent and weak when you try to speak to someone about the whole issue you get a robot not only is the customer service non existent you also put up the prices of the non existent service,Bad
2195,bad customer service and attitude with customer,Bad
2196,awful service when you leave my phone was part of a multi device account and i was not the account holder but the phone was registered to me after paying for two years i had to ask the account holder to request to end the contract and ask for a pac code as i wanted to switch providers for a better deal the pac code was not obtained on contacting ee i was told i could not get a pac code but they would unlock my phone it would take up to days and i would have a different number i have now been days without a phone being unable to keep my number is unacceptable as i have some online accounts and apps that send an sms before i can even acess them to notify a change of number and therefore leaves me unable to pay bills,Bad
2197,started with bt and all was good then the guy in the ee shop said i could have faster internet included for the same price when i went in about my phone so obviously i agreed turned out the bloke didnt know what he was kn about and my bill had increased by a month so i rang bt to change it back to the original services nd they did this and reduced my bill for that month to correct price all good i thought then i got my next months bill which the price has increased again for except ive not got the faster internet tried to talk to bt about it but all they have said is its tough basically so now im basically being ripped off every month i would steer well clear of bt absolutely rubbish service,Bad
2198,terrible service months since installation of services and we still have no working phone line numerous calls have been made to virgin customer services to no avail the response we now get is this has been escalated do not call us we will call you clearly they dont as we still dont have a working landline promises of call backs over the last months not once has this been of my time has been wasted absolutely shocking service avoid joining complaint has been ongoing since th may still no resolution or explanation as to what the problem is,Bad

2201,wife changed her mobile provider from ee to vodafone biggest mistake of her life completely useless customer service a simple transfer with puk code being provided should of only taken hours days she still had no phone service despite speaking with several people in their customer service section all of them completely and utterly a care in the world one even disconnected the call when he didnt know how to solve the problem in the end we visited a vodafone shop today where the service was excellent and managed to resolve the issue i would avoid this provider,Bad
2202,recently taken out tv mobile and land line contract mostly automated contact system of communication with company so virtually impossible to speak to a human being when live chat was achieved with a few different members of staff i gained nothing from any of them although they told me that theyd solved my problem the problem was that i wanted to keep my existing house and mobile numbers it was never resolved and i am now stuck with new numbers it would appear that i was told son has had even more varied problems with the company still unresolved regrets all round at using vm would never recommend to anybody,Bad
2203,we purchased a ee dongle as advised by bt when our broadband was down we were advised that the we paid was for the first month june to th july we cancelled the contract on the th june as it was only required for this one month until bt repaired broadband however we received an invoice two weeks later for to be debited by direct debit we called and they advised that the contact had not been cancelled and they cancelled it again advising it would end on th july and that no further payments were required we then received a letter dated rd july advising we had not paid and that they had added a default to our credit reference history you can imagine how incensed we were at this called today to no avail they give you the run around and false promises of return calls even if you pay the your credit file is still affected i would strongly advise against using ee if you value your credit rating,Bad

2219,i have had a package for which i naively agreed to pay an excessive monthly rate of per month over the past year this has now been reduced to although this is still pm more than virgin has offered to new customers according to virgin it is their policy to offer better deals to new the massive monthly charge we have been without broadband since december virgin say the service is intermittent and to justify this description mentioned one occasion since december when the wifi had apparently lasted for minutes before disconnecting im sure anyone can appreciate how disruptive and useless a service is that connects and disconnects continuously every few minutes on and december i was assured that the deadline for resolving the engineering problem was december on december i was told that the problem will be resolved by december i have wasted ages on the phone getting bounced from one option to another and being kept on i initially call the virgin number a recorded message informs me that it is aware of the problem in my area and offers to provide text updates on progress i accepted this option week ago and yet have not received a single recognition of the lack of broadband now in its th day virgin say they will credit my account with as virgin already has a one star rating i dont suppose my comments will make a jot of difference they are clearly not bothered by their poor service,Bad

2232,hi have been a customer of vodafone for a few years now and they have always been happy to take my money on my direct debit even when my son spent way above what we agreed but that is my changed banks months ago and my direct debit got lost in the process i wanted to pay what was owed and start a new contract as my year contract was onto website to find a number to to contact section expecting number to be there but mislaid details about how to go on live chat and spent about hours searching until i found a number to may be old and naive but it should not be this difficult to find a phone to say the guy i got through to seemed genuine and hopefully the problem is solved if not ill let you the secrecy around a number to speak to a human left wondering now if this was a fake number have contacted bank just in case found this website and was not surprised at this stage about the problems people encounter with will tell if i tolerate their poor service,Bad

2356,usually i give the benefit of the doubt to bad reviews but in virgin medias case they seem to be well deserved i decided to move from sky to virgin based on the significant cost savings but the savings come at the price of poor service i ordered broadband and picked an install date the first red flag was the date being changed to weeks later with no information the technician turned up and told me the cable needed to be replaced but he had no idea when i get a message with a new install date but the cable hadnt been done so the appointment was shifted by another weeks this now makes weeks from placing the order to install at this point i decided that it wasnt worth the wait and poor service and given the other poor scores here i cancelled the order and am staying with sky who incidentally have always given me great service and dealt with any issues quickly,Bad
2357,vodafone as one of the biggest carrier in australia has provided the worst customer service in my personal experience i have been with this carrier for more than years i believe there more people out there that has business with them for over decades they treated me as a human being the customer representative and the floor supervisor with id call reference on pm aest giving a false promise that i could have an offer of additional discount of month and it brings down to sim only plan on months contract however i could earlier today to confirm the promise another customer service has told me that is expired last month and i could not be able to get what has been offered to me i also asked her to give me a call back to manage my situation as they dont offer me any solution but direct me to take whatever presented by mentioned to id that i needed them to make sure to write a note on my file so i dont have to myself unfortunately they dont care about a single person they offer me instead of i know most people will say im stupid because its only trying to make a point that vodafone has misrepresent their promise and lack of training their staff to fit on the customer satisfaction they discriminate me perhaps as i am a foreigner they could do anything towards is a misleading information that they have provided you read this please ensure you dont face the same experience like i do change to other carrier to mitigate any further issue with are some other carrier that offer similar and better networks and customer services out you,Bad

2492,poor speed is so package is faster fibre my broadband is not achieving the speeds to notify you i have follow your broadband guide to ensure you arent the cause of my own problems first i did not expect of receiving broadband maximum speed level but my speed is not even near the minimum level my broadband is not achieving the speeds promised speed check from mbps to maximum mbps and they are asking me to pay the engineer to do a check this is ridiculous i pay for the service i expect to receive service shocking service not achieving the speeds promised and i have to pay for the engineer to be checked,Bad
2493,date of experience july,Bad
2494,it took phone calls and agents who could barely speak english to sort out my mothers bill which they had put up a month disgusting to do this to my mother who is an o a p making her bill a month for a basic package also agents hung up on me this is a disgrace virgin media are pathetic money grabbing company who have no loyalty to there customers my mum and dad have been with them for at leat years this is awful,Bad
2495,virgin didnt active my data its been a week now ive been with them since yrs but they would send u the bill immediately and wouldnt let u use the internet free for even a day,Bad

2499,illegal running s cancelled my contract via letter they ignored it done it via phone call and also wanted a pak number the cocky prat on the phone mumbled so i couldnt get the number and now vodafone are telling me i havent given notice see you in court vodafone will be coming down on you like a tonne of bricks i know my rights and i know what evidence i have,Bad

3617,ive had experience of a number of broadband and telecoms providers and whilst everyone seems to want to compete for your money by being the cheapest ive found that the service you get is generally poor i saw zen mentioned in which magazine earlier in the year and when my previous contract allowed i moved to zenit hasnt been totally seamless but i know that it very rarely can be in the uk broadband market where bt still owns almost all the actual network what matters to me is that when i do need assistance the quality of staff and service is better than anyone elses they cant promise that youll never have a problem last week my area suffered in the thunderstorms and we lost service for a day but they can promise to be extremely helpful when that read some of the other reviews on trustpilot and seen criticism of zen there can always be problems but broadband isnt a guaranteed service and i know from experience that a lot of factors affect the broadband speed youll get in your living room its only been a few months so far but i can see myself sticking with zen,Good

4289,i am writing this review of all the feedback that i can see regarding virgin am going to remain anonymous however i would like to point out a few things that i find very hard to swallow regarding comments about the some peoples theories into the we are all facing currently i feel the business are making the right choice into making key workers and the aged and vulnerable and business and those who have a total loss of service a priority there are so many factors too take into consideration that some people are blinded to see such as people damaging there property maybe such as the green boxes general wear and tear incidents upgrading resolving issues where possible hours a day days a week as a business have sore one comment that said i was charged calling my own number this is a joke my response was why are you ringing your own home phone number from your own home phone and secondly did you make that call outside your tariff i do not see any logic in this and would question any reasonable logic to do thati see a lot of complaints regarding the wifi and how it becomes not reliable and intermittent i have found plenty of information and help and videos on their website and other sources to show people how to best manage the wifi and how it works and where i can appreciate some agents are not technically minded there are some that are and go above and beyond to i will finish on is this we all plan for tomorrow but some may never see the end of are some people that have lost loved ones and people in the background trying their best to help those in need as mentioned above or people having bogus men come round trying to con money saying there from there internet company which was on twitter some have no telephone and are aged and if there was a accident they may not be able to call we all as a country have to work together and have mutual respect in understanding even though someone calling virgin media media just remember there trying to look after those in desperate need due to the which nobody including virgin media did not see coming and having to what i can see make adaptations in order to keep the business going with million customers i have extra tv box in the bedroom is not a priority currently but a elderly lady or man whom is struggling to make a emergency call is and i would say remember that next time you speak to agent and you will see that everyone is doing there best for you i think virgin are fantastic and i never had a problem with my service,Good

4894,a payg customer for over a decade and never had a problem with the exception of the december outage which for all intents and purposes was outwith their control os infrastructure not tms you cannot expect uptime from any network its up of the time which is brill great coverage throughout the uk think there was only a couple of places in rural scotland where reception was non existent when i was out and about but otherwise super g coverage everywhere else great value payg rocket packs i love how you can choose them via the app pick and choose your rocket pack size each month if you so wish im not a mega heavy data user who streams hd netflix when im on the move just enough data for a social media and and to check payg app is useful for topping up renewing and changing rocket packs tariffs and checking your usage for the given month ive seldom had to contact customer services but when i did so recently they quickly resolved my query professionally and efficiently their online chat and facebook pms are brilliant friendly too to my fellow tm customers who have their own beef with the network provider sure youre angry etc but know this treat others how you want to be yourselves a little politeness goes a long way in a conversation it works both ways dont be snotty and acting like a little ive always been polite and friendly to those that have dealt with me and in return they have resolved my query in no time at all and in a friendly manner as a result during the outage back in december there was a big uproar from network customers about the service being down reading all the posts and staff recieved on facebook i left my post with my thoughts on the wanted the staff to read something positive during that time and there was someone sympathetic to their woes during the outage sure the outage affected me also but it was hardly the apocalypse happening was it give all the staff at tesco you for keeping us updated on things that for all intents and purposes were outwith your control this was os problem and i can only begin to imagine the you must have received over the past day or two but hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel and things can get back to understand that it is impossible to have uptime on any network your network works brilliantly of the time imo and ive never had a problem until yesterdays gremlin appeared people never make an effort to compliment operators when things work smoothly of the time but boy they are quick to demand the ceos head on a plate when things do go wrong of the time i dont expect compensation im not going to throw my dummy out the pram and threaten to go to another network provider its just one of those things that do very rarely happen life goes on but lord help us of ww ever breaks out thats all im a deep breath and carry on tesco mobile when you get home pour yourself a strong one weve been together years and i still love you ove tesco mobile,Good
