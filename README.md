## Overview

This repository provides data and implementations for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to real-world customer service interactions in the British telecommunications industry. The primary objective is to enhance customer experience by leveraging state-of-the-art topic modeling and clustering methods.

The work explores:
- Efficient topic modeling with short text (e.g., customer complaints and support tickets)
- Comparison of unsupervised clustering techniques
- Practical deployment scenarios for telecom use cases
