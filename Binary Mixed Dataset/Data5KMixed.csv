2,very poor service first of all do not update online changes as i am years costumer and always waa topping up for gb data for the last few times when i top up the same amount for the same bundle it gave me only gb data and when i ask by calling costumer service whats the reason they just told me next month about june that when i top up again it will allow gb they do not explain the right and properly the things just to tak money today when i call again to clear everything out from my mind i asked about the information when i top up how much data will give me she just told me gb and i asked if its going to always from now like that she said yes so guys in my opinion there is no reason to use this card anymore because the online offers are not right there about the you,Bad,1.0

4,we went with talktalk because they were the cheapest provider at the time and now i know have had nothing but trouble since we joined them most recently we moved house they charged us a home moving fee after saying this would be free they failed to provide broadband for us as promised didnt send an engineer around even though we waited in and didnt contact us when i made a complaint i was promised phone calls to follow up which never came their communication was shocking the second go live date came and went still no broadband customer services were appalling when we called them for help we were on the phone over an hour every time they were very reluctant to escalate the complaint and we really had to push for this over a month later we still have no broadband and have been charged despite this in order to close the complaint they have agreed to let us leave our contract without the early get out charge thank goodness ill not have to have anything to do with them from now i feel incredibly frustrated by the last month or so and wish for others to avoid the stress avoid avoid avoid this company shouldnt be trading worst experience of a company ever please pay a little extra and go with somebody who can actually provide a service,Bad,1.0

6,if talktalk is contracting customer service out they should find a better provider if this is an in house team they should make this team redundant and start afresh the mentality of the support team is wrong and it can not be changed it has to start with the right foundation yesterday i waited mins for technical support twice after mins someone picked the phone up and put the receiver down i have been waiting for a broadband connection for weeks and three days the phone line exists it should be a one day work but everybody in talktalk is sitting around waiting things to happen magically as a customer i have to chase talktalk o get them do their work customer service is not trying to improve our experience or solve the problems before it infuriates us they must have been instructed to kick the ball further away hoping that problems will be solved by themselves unfortunately problems never just gets resolved automatically eventually someone has to do something the customer either gives up on talktalk and move to another provider or if he is lucky he will finally find a competent person who can deal with the problem i have not spoken to anybody who wants to help so far i have called hundred times in the last days,Bad,1.0

20,we pay for fibre broadband from talktalk the broadband service is frequently losing its connection entirely for days at a time and the customer service experience is atrocious and makes it virtually impossible to get any of the faults support service for talktalk is a web chat with people from a script you know theyre doing this because they sometimes paste the now ask the customer part by mistake they take minutes to respond to every single input and show zero initiative or even basic understanding of what theyre asking they ignore all information given to them upfront and follow their script like robots forcing you to perform the same pointless diagnostic steps every time you speak with them even when youve done so our case talktalk decided the fault was with our router despite the router itself clearly saying the fault was with the connection to the cabinet they insisted on sending us a replacement router which did not fix the problem they eventually arranged for an engineer to visit who fixed the problem in the cabinet a week later it broke again as of this moment our connection is still broken and we are back to square zach your choice to ignore almost every point i made and provide such a worthless unhelpful response is completely in keeping with the attitude of your fellow talktalk staff and only serves to demonstrate the truth of my complaint,Bad,1.0

40,i am writing this review to share my recent disappointing experience with vodafone on may i placed an order for a new phone due to my current one being broken the delivery was promised for may th as reflected in my confirmation email sadly the promised delivery date was missed on reaching out to customer service i was informed that my order was waiting for permission to pick and that the delay was due to dpd not having picked up my order however upon contacting dpd they informed me that they had not received any such delivery instruction from vodafone over the next days i repeatedly called vodafone customer service only to receive ambiguous responses conflicting information and no definitive solution the consistent lack of clarity and action has left me without a working phone for several days causing significant inconvenience even more frustrating is the seeming lack of concern or responsibility taken by vodafone to resolve this issue swiftly it is concerning that a telecom provider fully aware of the importance of communication devices in this day and age seems unable or unwilling to prioritise and address such a basic and crucial aspect of their light of these circumstances i regret to say that my trust in vodafone has been significantly shaken its unfortunate to experience such service from a brand that i have associated with reliability and efficiency in the pastas of now im still waiting for my order and a resolution to my complaint i hope that no other customer has to go through this level of frustration and web,Bad,1.0

68,i signed up with talk mobile to a sim only contract on june i had used their website coverage checker to make sure signal worked in the place i lived and the place i worked when the sim arrived it worked fine at home but did not get signal in my place of work there was a day cooling off period in my contract so i contacted them on the july via their webchat service and told them that there was no signal at my work place of work and they agreed to cancel my contract and refund my first month payment and close my account with no charge i have the webchat transcript on my email as evidence which has been sent to the ombudsman now i even double checked in that conversation that i wouldnt be charged anything and they confirmed july i contacted talk mobile again after they took from my account i explained that i had cancelled my contract and the reasons for that and they agreed a mistake had been made they told me that i had to cancel the payment with my bank and then they would zero the balance their end i was not happy about this but i was told this was the only way to do it and so i followed their instructions and the amount was refunded to my account i thought that was the end of october i received a letter to tell me that i had been refused my application for a bank account and credit based on a negative reference from experian i immediately signed up to experian and completed a credit check it revealed that i had out of an excellent rating however there was a black mark against my report due to unpaid debt to talk mobile i immediately phoned talk mobile and after completing the security questions and before i could even say why i was calling they said are you calling about your credit report they immediately apologised for what had happened and said they would put it right i told them that i felt i should be compensated for the embarrassment they had caused me the cost of my credit check with experian the time i had spent sorting out the mistaken payments the time lost on my failed application the cost of my phone call to their call centre and the time it would now take me to resolve the bank application not to mention compensate the stress and the long term affect that this black mark might have on future credit applications talk mobile said they couldnt give me compensation as i wasnt a customer anymore so i told them i would contact the ombudsman instead they immediately changed their tune and promised a manager would call me within working days to discuss some is working days later and ive had no call so i called them back again at more cost to me they informed me that no manager was available to talk to me i told them i had given them their chance and i was now contacting the ombudsman to resolve the dispute they said fine ive also double checked my credit report and the negative mark is still on my you can imagine this issue is causing me a lot of stress i am very careful with money and credit and having this hanging over me for a phone bill that i shouldnt have been charged is very distressing it all seems extremely heavy handed for even if i did owe the money and the fact i dont owe them any money and for the reasons set out above i feel that i should receive some compensation for the treatment i have received,Bad,1.0

170,although the technical support for talk talk are always friendly and appear to try to help i find the business practices of the company very disturbing when i first contacted them about my abysmally subpar speeds they suggested repeatedly that i buy new expensive products from them such as a new router a fibre package and a wifi booster firstly i should not have to buy more products to get the service that i am already paying for but also the router and the wifi booster would not have helped my problem at all and had i been someone more who didnt know any better i could have ended up spending large amounts of money without actually solving the problem i think this tactic they use is and i finally managed to get them to run some tests it turned out that i was right and my almost unusable speeds were not somehow caused by my usage but by a problem that an engineer would need to fix after waiting in all day for the scheduled engineer appointment no engineer showed up so i contacted them again and it turned out that the employee had not properly scheduled the appointment now any self respecting and honest company would send another engineer the same day to honor their agreement however i will now have to stay in another day for another engineer appointment which may or may not come to all this i have been compensated an offensively tiny amount for the time i have spent with speeds under the minimum guaranteed is very little sense of responsibility or accountability in this company and although their customer service is friendly it seems as though they have been trained to make it as difficult as possible to get help beyond simple advice,Bad,1.0

203,on behalf on my nan and grandad they were with talk talk for many years now grandad has passed and nan in a care home due to dementia we cancelled the contract surprisingly they could do this without any security from was cancelled but they still billed and took money for a couple of months tried to phone up to sort it out but they couldnt talk to us due to not knowing the password anyway after a couple of months they stopped and stated that account was in credit and wed need to contact them to get it refunded which is backwards as most companies just refund you but we dont know the password and they wont talk to us and state they cant just refund until they cant talk to the account holder and get the password which isnt a complaint email on th september had a generic response then raised it as a complaint no response so sent a chase email in early november no response sent another one in december to finally get an acknowledgment received a text on tuesday to say they will contact me within working days so friday but get a call on saturday lady sounded and couldnt be bothered and the first question asked was can we have the password i asked if she had actually read the complaint as this wasnt possible ultimately all are asking for is the to be refunded to the same account the direct debit came from but all she kept repeating was we cant do that unless you know the password etc then tried to use an example to say along the lines they wont refund based on our calls as we could be an and is trying to get the money fraudulently this is very stange as they let you cancel the contract without any security and this could be done but the only response was thats a different policy this point the complaint manager i presume hung up had a text an hour later saying we will call you later between pm but guess what no call seems such a simple resolution were not asking for bank account details to be changed or anything dodgy we just want the money refunded back to the same account they have on their there is a policy to get added as a rd party but in our situation it wasnt possible we have no power of attorney nothing from the courts massive backlog and getting anything from a solicitor or a doctor would cost us money which we are not going to do so talk talk are holding onto an amount of money owed to an elderly lady with dementia for no reason and with no real means of us getting the money back to her account to help pay for her service and would never recommend them to if you read this alina please dont reply saying call you talk talk as your team wont be able to help as we cant get through security,Bad,1.0

222,if you wish to retain your sanity then please do not engage the services of this company not even with a where should i start i moved address and unfortunately the provider was not able to provide service to that area this is understandable i have never had sight of any contract that the service provider was claiming to have sent me i was told that because i was still in contract i would have to pay a termination fee and would not receive a refund of my remaining line rental which i had paid in advance i have sent many complaints to virgin about this issue but am receiving no real resolution instead i get told that my complaint is being passed from one manager to another and this process continues unabated no common sense or fair play has been exercised by the representatives dealing with my complaint i believe they should issue me with a refund for my unused line rental and waive the termination fee its not my fault that the address i have moved to is not serviceable by virgin media its probably a good thing that they are not operating where i am now living pay a little extra and you may find that you get better service rather than being constantly off,Bad,1.0
223,i signed up to a bundle which never linked to my account through error even activating my account had to be done on the phone as the online process was unnecessarily confusing and asked for details no other company has ever requested when i realised my bundle never activated this wasnt easy to work out i had to buy of credit which was used up in one day i only used data while i was out for about twenty minutes the signal was largely unusable i would expect signal to be much better in a city centre in the south east of england the bundle error and poor signal led me to try and cancel two phone calls and it still wasnt sorted as they refused to give me a pac code the text message didnt work and said i had to call i was told i had to request it by email despite stating clearly that i wasnt willing to negotiate and just wanted the code they again refused to comply and asked for the reason i wanted to leave again and told me i had to allow up to hours for them to fix the issue not true luckily the standard text worked by this point and i got back to a better provider,Bad,1.0
224,i became a new customer with talktalk business on th july they gave me an installation date to install a new line for rd august which was great a few days later i got an email saying they couldnt install on that date and it was now going to be th august still ok my slot was pm the engineer appeared at pm he looked at the main box said it was too dark to see the wires properly as they werent issued with torches and said it would take too long to run the cable along the hallway of meters as it would have to go above the tiles on the suspended ceiling and he was up at am for a very important job that couldnt be done any other time then left i now have to wait until th august for another appointment over weeks with no phone or internet in our offices and no one at talktalk can do anything about it not very happy,Bad,1.0
225,my law passed away recently and i phoned talktalk to ask for the account to be transferred to my name the woman on the line said something about waiting about days for the change waited only for my to be cut off shes rang talktalk to be told that an email had tried to be sent for signed authorisation but as they had no email address on account it had not been on phone now to whatever country then passed to a lovely lad in belfast who has passed me to a security team who is now calling me me back to ask what number i wanted reinstated the number that obviously my has had for being told this is not possible so i have asked to speak to a manager because this is has said it is not possible at this moment to release the original number but will give me a number to ring to try to retrieve it once they have installed a new have had to set up a new direct debit in my name to be able to book an engineer to now rung the number i was given to be told that i was misinformed and old number cannot be reinstated because it is not am now speaking to someone in south africa who obviously does not understand my law wears a security fob to enable her to press if she has a fall and her landline number is connected to this so it is does not even cover it i have now been on to talktalk for hours going round in not go there is all i can in all and my review on here and asked me to email them i have and its bounced back,Bad,1.0

231,i tried to upgrade with them today with a deal on was for the fixed price unlimited faster fibre for months priced at that we can see on other comparison sites as clicked on uswitch above advertisement after claiming voucher from uswitch and went to talk talk website where it was a different offer altogether i clicked on chat and had to listen to different people telling me there is no such told them to check out uswitch and they will see a few of their advertisements and the one i wanted was the very first one being advertised no reply on then started procedure to get me a deal each one being far in advance of the for faster fibre took nearly hours and i was just having enough when they stopped the chat how more was a slightly different ad to yesterday as the voucher they were offering is now they should be done for false advertising they are there so take them down if you dont acknowledge them,Bad,1.0
232,unfortunately no option for zero stars dont touch them with a they more than tripled my mobile tariff and wouldnt budge on price as is my right i cancelled my contract and paid phone off they carried on trying to charge me and even put me in hands of debt collectors despite admitting i owed nothing in disgust i cancelled my landline and broadband in june and they are still trying to take money off me i have lost count of number of people allegedly sorting it all out but nothing improves i wouldnt recommend them to my worst enemy,Bad,1.0

235,absolute load of rubbish never listen never sort out problems never give compensation like they say they will always customers fault not theirs takes ages to get through to them only to be put on hold whilst you are transferred to someone who knows nothing about your problem having to explain to different people before someone says have you tried restarting your device well der never thought of that,Bad,1.0

237,my broadband contract was coming to an end so i rang bt to say that i would be leaving them and moving to strangely enough they said that they could do the exact same package that i was on for just more a month than thinking that that would be better that the swapping provider i asked again is this for the exact broadband package that i am on now and was told yes the exact same package so i decided not to change days later i received an email saying that i had to return my wifi disc that boosts the signal around the house i rang bt to ask why and they said that is because i was getting it cheaper and would loose the disc i said that i was told that nothing would change and they said that it cannot be done at that price i then went back to and got the super wifi router with g back up for a month less than the lesser package that i was conned into going with by the untruthful bt rep in this economical climate how can bt afford to treat customers that way,Bad,1.0

273,hello this has just happened to me and i thought i should share the experience five days ago i lost my iphone i called my network provider o within minutes of losing it and spoke to a person on their helpline for lost phones i gave them my details and was assured by the helpline person that my phone had been wiped and that a new sim card would be sent to me as it was a saturday night followed by a monday i left it until today thursday before becoming a little concerned that my sim card had not arrived when i contacted o this time via a live conversation with their online support i was shocked to be told they had no record of the lost phones cancellation i do have a record that the call was made i made it from my wifes phone so my phone was still active after being lost for five whole days they told me not to worry and that they would cancel it and send me a new sim i declined the new sim my deal is via carphone warehouse and i now know i can go into one of their shops and get a new phone and sim without having to wait more days for o to endeavour to successfully post me a sim o did not tell me this they were happy to waste more of my time they also did not volunteer to check whether the phone had been used since i reported it missing i had to ask them to do this and only then did they tell me that it hadnt been used to make calls which was a relief the not to worry part i found pretty patronising of course i am worried not to mention hugely inconvenienced and pretty shocked at their complacency my phone had been lost and active for five days anybody who found it could potentially have made calls accessed my phone contacts my family photographs my email accounts personal details that were in my notes and seen my diary and therefore my movements over the coming months this to me is a serious breach of privacy on os account because i trusted them to look after my information i will not trust them again i would like others to know that even reporting a phone lost or stolen and speaking directly to the o network does not ensure that your data will be looked after by this network if it can happen to me it must happen to others as a footnote i was given a telephone number to call by the o handler i spoke to online to make a complaint i called the number just now i held for more than ten minutes then an automated message told me that the phone line had now closed and that i should call back tomorrow,Bad,1.0

561,going back about four years ago our broadband speed was bad really bad so when bt infinity fibre became available in our area we were quick to sign up after that the service while not blazingly fast was a reliable mbs and we were happy and forgot all about ita couple of weeks ago i got an email from bt offering us the new bt smart hub at a reduced price of rather than the full retail price of i decided to place an order for the new smart hub to replace our aging home hub in the hope that it would improve our rather patchy wifi signal remember this for few days after that i was reviewing our expenditure on utilities that i realised to my horror that we were paying a month for phone and broadband so started looking around for better deals and lets be honest every deal other than the price gouging deal we were on was better i decided to go with sky and placed an order which unbelievably was going to reduce our monthly telecoms bill by a month for the first six months and then a month thereafter absolutely that point my wife thought it might be worth a call to bt to check whether they could offer anything better than the deal we were currently on and with the phone on loudspeaker so i could hear we were both absolutely horrified by the absolutely terrible customer service and the bad attitude we were faced with by the woman on the end of the when my wife asked if there was a better package we were told no there wasnt and that we had to stay on bt infinity now for those that dont know bt infinity offers speeds of up to mbs infinity up to mbs and infinity up to mbs my wife asked if the cheaper infinity option would be a better option as we were only getting a speed of mbs due to our distance from the cabinet we were told categorically that we would need to stay on the most expensive package to maintain our current speed and that there was no cheaper option open to when told that we were planning on moving to sky we were told that sky offered no such service in our area the woman said shed even asked her manager and he also agreed that there was no alternative service which was odd given that we had checked online the night before and successfully placed an order with sky even so after the call to bt we called sky who confirmed that they did offer an unlimited fibre option in our area and were puzzled by bts claim that we would not get the same speeds as before as it was their infrastructure being changing topic my wife asked why we hadnt received our new smart hub we were surprised when the woman told us that they had cancelled our order because they were out of stock a pretty unusual business practice and given we were choosing to leave bt we wouldnt be eligible for the offer my wife said that we were still bt customers at that point and they should honour the offer but the woman said that we could not place an order we were pleasantly surprised when the smart hub dropped through the letter box the next sky broadband is now up and running and predictably were getting the same speed we were getting with bt but at a fraction of the cost while the broadband service we received from bt was good the prices were absolutely ridiculous and when questioned the bt customer service representative we spoke to simply lied about the products they could offer lied about the competition and lied about our eligibility for the smart hub which is nothing short of staggering my wife wants to contact the ombudsman but im not sure i can be bothered weve changed our telecoms provider now and we will never return to bt with abysmal service like this and a clear policy of price gouging bt deserve all the failure thats coming to them,Bad,1.0

726,i have been with virgin media virgin mobile for years and years i used to thing they are superior to the competition perhaps they i recommended them to my neighbours my own broadband speed plummeted and i suspected they had theirs onto i was sent a new box i was several boxes out of date im conflicted here on the one hand i dont agree with throw away tech however i also dont agree with leaving so called loyal customers with inferior tech and not updating itthe tv frequently records sound only and almost always has pictures only when i go to catch up on demand so i have to watch on my phone on demand on a different tv not connected to the tivo or my laptop i was sent boosters to try to improve service in the bedroom i live in a flat not a mansion its in the room next door to the box its still i was sent a new box they said dont bother with the boosters they dont do anything and this is all you need its almost as kept checking the dire broadband connection remotely and reporting it when i had the energy to and being told there were no problems until eventually i was told there had been an area problem for a couple of months and i seem to remember it was months or so before t was fixed i kept resorting to using my phone data and having to be on zoom with no video on i was being continually dropped from zoom meetings too the fix date slipped when eventually it was fixed the internet speeds were still poor i asked about compensation and was told because the service was there just bad there is no long afterwards my contract was coming up for review and i phoned up to say im leaving and to switch provider the guy was really well trained he persuaded me that mb or whatever the superfast speed i had was way too slow to expect zoom to work and he talked me into upgrading its still bad i often have to switch off video on zoom i often see your internet is unstable warnings flash up i often have buffering the service in the bedrooms of the flat is as though i have no broadband i feel duped into staying with virgin just as soon as i can i will be leaving i bet nobody responds to this with more than platitudes no engineers get sent to do a proper diagnostic experience is once youre a paying customer they dont care that the service is experience is that engineers are friendly and helpful but have a ridiculous workload more than is possible or sustainable and yet the board must literally look at the financial bottom line and not give a flying about customer experience or selling a substandard product i hope the comments are reviewed by the board but suspect it sits with low or middle management who have no power to actually respond in a way that creates improvements for customers or staff prove me wrong do a case study do you dare to actually find out how poor virgin media reply came on th october fully explaining info available on the website as i suspected the board didnt have the proverbial to do a case study theyve ducked out of sight hiding behind the individual who left the response months after my comment thank you for the reply and in what wasnt said or done by the board it proves my point zero interest in current customers experience just leaving it to the poor person at the bottom of the pile to respond,Bad,1.0

900,note this contract was managed by me for my elderly mother i am with virgin do i start when i first took out their broadband service the website said if during the period of my contract a better offer was available then i could swap to that about months later they had a black friday sale so i thought i would renew at the new price they said that my current contract hadnt expired so i was not eligible the price promise only relates to broadband and basic line rental but doesnt include extras such as talk anytime or international call discounts they will increase prices on those services once they have you locked in to contract while new customers get the old prices or better if you log into the talktalk website to view your account then log back out they still know its you the sneaky part is that after your contract expires they show you new deals that are at a higher price than what new customers see they dont specify some deals as for new customers only but choose to be sneaky and show you different prices hoping to get you locked in for another years before you realise there was a better deal available they failed to notified me before my contract expired and immediately increased the cost of my services by without warning if you have a fault with your phone line they will force you to spend minutes on a mobile phone running up bills if you even have a mobile while they get you to jump through several hoops to carry out line tests they wont supply an number or call you back or use email or online chat so if you dont have a mobile you will need to borrow one and then spend minutes running up your bill or eating up your credits even though a faulty line is their problem not yours i found a cheaper deal and better package for less with sse no price rises on anything plus unlimited international calls and i am paying much less than tt and decided to leave talktalk even though they offered me a good deal if i stayed i dont trust them any more as i know they will bump up the prices elsewhere business is tough but they are not upfront and honest with their customers and that means i cant trust them so i am leaving no matter what they offer talktalk you need a lot more work to live up to your fairness pledge because i am not seeing any attempt at treating customers fairly i understand business is tough but you will lose customers if you continually mess them around,Bad,1.0

956,an elderly relative of mine who has been a loyal customer for many years received a letter from them regarding contacting them about an upgrade which she was required to phone about given that she is not tech savvy in all good faith she contacted them regarding this and as she didnt know her password to her account they were unable to assist her in anything however coincidentally the next day her landline stopped working luckily we contacted her her pay as you go mobile and she explained to us the contacted virgin media on her behalf after wearing out the keypad with the number of options available i managed to talk to a real person i think i explained the situation regarding the age of the account holder and that i live over miles away and that i dont have the password but there was an issue with her phone line not working this really flummoxed her so she politely informed me that because we dont have the password she is unable to even run a diagnostic on the phone without accessing the account and this could only be achieved by asking the account holder the security questions again i explained the situation and asked how we are supposed to contact her to ask the security question when we live miles away when the robot kicked in and kept repeating the same lines of the script over and over again like i was unable to understand the concept of the information being provided whereas a true customer service department maybe would have tried to help by finding a solution i know new concept where customer services help their customers rather than taking the money and not helping so now i am left with an elderly relative who has around of credit left on her mobile phone with no easy method of topping it up and the landline not working virgin media apparently are unable to do anything to even try and fix the problem in the mean time still taking the to this lets talk about the complaints system which appears in honestly to try every possible way not to receive complaints the phone number is the same as the customer services which i have lost all faith in so didnt even try the you need to have a virgin media account even when you press the i am not a customer button and the chat app asks you to use whatsapp which you go through the process of setting up to be told that due to unforeseen circumstances we are not able to offer support via messages for faults and then closes the conversation down great as i wasnt reporting a reverted back to the chat app which again went through the process of pressing the and required only to be told its is not to clarify virgin media a technology based company cannot access their own databases cannot diagnose or repair a landline cant set up a website to work correct cannot take complaint and have exceedingly poor customer services who have the ability to read but other than that not much help maybe the board should try sitting on the customer calls for a day just to see how effective there business is actually run and stop pretending that they are doing a good job,Bad,1.0

988,i had problems with customer services and at their purported director level i think everyone knows their date of birth i was asked this question a number of times and i was told i was incorrect on each checking my birth certificate thinking i was having a senior moment i tried yet again with vodafone i managed to speak to yet another individual after or so aborted calls and offered to fax my birth certificate to turned out as i had complained about their abysmal service a member of their staff had altered my date of birth on their system deliberately knowing it would cause me the maximum amount of inconvenience and disruption which of course it did an attempted excuse was proffered and all it did was to add insult to fact that they were unable to see who altered it shows how bad their record keeping is and a terrible it system that hides a user who enters the system so anyone can illegally obtain your data and alter it if they so desire and you will never be able to find out who the culprit might have mentioned this before but the latest saga confirms that staff actually get into your account and alter texts i had incredible problems with staff in egypt who had no idea how to communicate at paper billing was stopped yet again third time at least my on line data was deliberately disrupted so i could not get any of my information at all and still cant this has been going on for years literally and gave up with iti was sent their normal survey which i never answered at all i saw i had a few messages the next day unusual as i do not use the phone it is for emergencies only as i use a vodafone have been told this for years and deliberately ignore to ring the landline and ring the mobile and wonder why it is not was sent a survey which i never answered the first text asked if the issue was resolved the answer would have been a which meant a no the dishonest member of staff at vodafone answered which meant more questions followed re satisfaction and would i recommend vodafone to anyone else to being the lowest i might have given a for each answer the dishonest member of staff at vodafone answered to both which meant top marks invasion of privacy contravening the data protection act ofcom will be spoke to a member of staff and told them about this matter and they said it was not possible vodafone for once in your life listen to what a customer says if it has happened do not argue at all believe what the customer says and look into the matter i have this on the mobile and have photographed it in case they try to delete the texts if they can change your dob they can do anything to your data or i went on trustpilot to put this complaint online i could not believe the amount of negatives that were there it just shows how vodafone cares about their customers and how some members of staff treat them it is there in black and white so why has vodafone not done if you speak to a member of staff who could not care less about the inconvenience intrusion anguish disruption and distress they have caused they do not place any notes on to your account at all so the complaint and your concerns are never noted or registered at all so you have to repeat everything all over again to another member of staff wasting more and more valuable time yet you have repeated everything again to the fourth person you wonder why you are growing feathers as you may as well be a parrot having to repeat everything yet again i do apologise to the parrot fraternity but they are probably more understanding than some of,Bad,1.0

1181,absolutely terrible service ee provided misleading information to me on friday in order to secure a contract the operator was extremely unhelpful in supporting me as a customer in holding someone to account they spoke over me after listening to your operators monologue which was of no help but a series of defence and excuses to explain their lack of and attitude the phone call was suspiciously dropped as i begun to hold your operator to account they called back at which point i asked to be contacted by email by a senior operative of which your operative refused i am a working man who runs a business as a business customer i requested to be contacted by email which i find completely acceptable to request as a human being with autonomy and a business man paying for a service which you provide time and energy and the nature of my work dictate how i operative my business how i communicate refused to take this into consideration absolutely abysmal service my phones have not arrived yet which is good as i am now considering leaving ee i wish to hold the operator to account who relayed false information to me in order to secure the contract by extension me not working today losing earnings and who was absolutely abysmal to communicate and seek resolutions with when i relayed my issues to her i look forward to your response as i will keep on chasing this up however much of my time and energy will be wasted in order to hold ee to account commensurate will be my demands for accountability and compensation for such an abysmal service november to note i waited all day today on the th they sent the phones to a wrong address two days of earning i lost personal inconvenience having to waste time writing emails and making phone calls trying to hold ee to account for their disgusting service,Bad,1.0

1189,this company has been nothing but trouble i am not only writing a review here but also making a last ditch effort for help to resolve the issues as phone calls have proven useless the most recent reminder of the companies incompetence was this morning at am when i received a call from someone claiming to be from talktalk they told me that there was a problem with my internet connection and wanted to guide me through a series of commands on my laptop to resolve this problem luckily i had just heard on the radio that this was a scam targeting talk talk customers whose personal details and bank information were stolen during a hack of the companies database last year knowing that a group of criminals have access and are using my personal details and bank information sickens me however what is more sickening is the fact that talktalk do not see this as grounds for me to break my contract if i hadnt just heard about this on the radio i could have easily believed that this was a genuine call seeing as they knew i was a talktalk customer and knew my name moving on now to my second major problem i initially signed up with an month contract in september in september this year i moved house and expected the contract to remain with an end date of february however i was told on the phone that when i move i have to start a new contract i asked what the minimum contract length was and was told months i begrudgingly accepted what i was told to avoid the cancellation fees shortly after this i was approached by a talktalk salesman in the streets trying to sign me up with talktalk when i told him i was an unhappy existing customer he asked if he could help i told him the story and he said what i was told on the phone was not true and that i am allowed to move houses times within a contract when i received my new welcome package in the mail i read that not only am i on a new contract but it is an month contract with an end date of february moving on to my next problem i also unfortunately use talk talk for my mobile provider i originally signed up to a plan for unlimited everything for pounds a month however six months into this contract i received a text message saying that unfortunately talktalk have decided to no longer offer this plan and your data usage is now limited to gb per month this causes very high bills last month my bill was around pounds for internet usage on top of this i am unable to use my phone outside of the uk when i travel i am forced to buy local sim cards and take the talktalk one am bored of listing the problems i have encountered with this company so i am just going to finish up by asking for your help i ideally want out of all my contracts with talktalk which is not unreasonable seeing as talktalk have leaked my personal information and bank details to a third party criminals without my consent this third party is now using my details to try and scam me its also not unreasonable to ask that my contract be terminated for my mobile phone as the plan i agreed to when i signed up now does not exist please do not ask me to send a tweet to resolve these issues i do not have twitter or wish to discuss these problems in or less and as previously mentioned calls to your call centers have been useless i expect an email or telephone call from someone who is actually able to resolve these issues my account number is william mcroberts,Bad,1.0
1190,i tried to change my direct debit details online no luck they wouldnt allow call to o i was passed from one person to the next eventually being put on hold for minutes with no indication when or even if my call would be call on hold for minutes only to be told my direct debit couldnt be on hold i browsed through their website and was shocked at the prices of their why anyone would choose this network is beyond me im only with o because virgin mobile offloaded me onto them ill be changing my phone operator,Bad,1.0
1191,do not use this company they are an absolute disgrace i cancelled my new phone upgrade and have written confirmation of this on their webchat they then sent a new iphone out to my old address even though i had cancelled the order i have the dpd drivers van details the date and time he picked up the phone to return to the warehouse from the security camera which the new owners of my old house kindly gave me but now o say the phone was never returned to the warehouse and hence i have no phone and i am paying for a contract with no phone i have spent hours on their webchat and each time i am assured the matter will be resolved and yet nothing happens i am beyond and angry i now feel my only option is to sue them their customer service is beyond a joke all they ever say is please give me a few minutes to look into this and then disappear after hours of this i am then put through to a manager who then repeats the same stuff as the earlier agent and again assures me all will be well and yet nothing this has been going on since the th february and we are now the st february i have no phone and want to cancel the contract for a phone i cancelled anyway and they say i cant because the phone has not reached the warehouse then today a dhl driver turned up at my old house to pick up the legendary phone to add to the confusion i wish to god i had never ever dealt with this disgraceful company i am so upset and angry and being off for hours on their webchat they made the mistake and sent out a cancelled order so how can i resolve it it is their fault they sent out a cancelled order to my old not mine and i am beyond distressed that they are charging me for a phone i dont have never had and now dont want as i will never deal with them again,Bad,1.0
1192,everything is good when you are a new customer and have just signed up and then it get progressively worse until you have to threaten to leave not to mention constant outages poor customer service everything is in india now and everything else is an automated robot that provides the info really dissapointed so we are leaving,Bad,1.0

1195,my phone line went out at am last sunday i know this because my house alarm activated and woke me up i checked all the usual things which tt ask you to check when you call them eg bt master socket but line was dead ran online service check using my mobile and was told my line was them at am after ascertaining that several other people in the village had lost their services too all tt customers informed that the village exchange had experienced an incident and that it was in hand at pm a tt text informed me my services were working again which would have been amusing had the house alarm not still been sounding and my phone line dead called them and was informed the issue was definitely fixed so my loss of service was obviously down to a fault on my line absolutely tripe of course as three neighbours were still without service they insisted in booking a bt engineer and gave me the usual blah about its if earliest appointment was days day before the appointment i get a text saying the engineer has been and fixed your fault oh no he hadnt noone had been near us and the line had continued to be dead i had by this time cut the alarm siren wire inside the story not short its now thursday and of course still no service tt acknowledged today that there is still a network fault oh really but that an engineer will still have to be assigned very sorry sir but we let the last appointment go so it will now be monday at the earliest meantime ive paid today to buy mobile data to use whilst working at home which will probably last until tomorrow and everything is still guy on the phone today actually agreed with me that perhaps they should have contacted me by text phone call whatever to check that my services had indeed been restored and were working before cancelling the engineer appointment and telling me that they were working when they were expected nothing less so im not as disillusioned as i might have been if id had any illusions in the first choose talktalk for broadband tv or phone services they simply piggyback onto bt lines and equipment and have no engineers of their own tech support is from a continent far away from here which provides its own difficulties and i can find nothing positive to say about them,Bad,1.0
1196,internet got me through pandemic working from home however june i was told i would no longer be charged for second tv box as not supported and this change would happen automatically and be adjusted on my bill i am still paying for it after several unsuccessful attempts to get in touch and fix it we dont use the second box anyway the tv signal glitches regularly meaning we have pixelated picture and sound on a regular almost daily basis shows are unwatchable and recorded shows are the same meaning we have had to miss out episodes from a series and try to work out the story we missed i pay per month for a tv service i can barely use and have had to resort to dvd to have something to watch on multiple occasions customer service is notoriously bad if you ever do manage to get through so not worth bothering only put up with it for the internet speed which apparently is now slower than other providers not impressed at all,Bad,1.0
1197,do not agree to upgrade to future fibre from talk talk they will use each other as an excuse for as to why a delayed connection no explanation on how the old line as been disconnected and your old account now longer exists spending hours on chat lines and going around in circles technical blaming sales and sales blaming technical and managers not returning calls and complaints not being registered after i posted this talk talk had the ignorance to say their team at on facebook or twitter is here to help what a joke their technical can not help their chat lines cannot help their customer services can not help but the team on facebook can,Bad,1.0

1227,the worse experience with anything ever it started at the end of september when i placed an order for their full fiber and tv package it was more expensive than the competition but because it was a line take over they told me it should take only days to get it set up as opposed to other companies that told me it would take a month or more th of october was the initial activation date and the only thing that goes live is the landline super useful in and nothing else apparently there was a need for additional work before they could get the broadband installed so i was pushed back to the th on the th an engineer came and told me he could not install the fiber broadband because there is no fiber run to this building apparently open reach has also messed up their site and had the wrong details about what kind of broadband can be installed at my address this is the beginning of the downward that bt doesnt know how to deal with the problem they put me on a temporary copper connection straight out of with less than mbps speed on average and tell me it might take up to weeks to fix the problem at least the tv line was activated so good job there i it only take a couple of weeks for open reach to fix their mess but when i thought it was finally over it turns out that the original fiber broadband i have order is no longer available in fact there is no more plan available only as confused as i was i said fine get me that one and lets be done with small problem because the initial order has gone through it has glitched the system and no one can cancel the order now in order to place a new one now this is the peak of autism for bt when i call to ask for a solution someone tells me that it might be faster to make a new account in my name the original was in my fathers name and take over the line what he failed to mention is the penalties that will be incurred for doing so i call them and ask them about that and they told me its all very unfortunate and we are very sorry but there is nothing that we can do i was directed to the billing department to dispute it and will update this review with the after all that more that month of delay you would think that i finally got my services activated wrong th of december was the new activation date and that day comes and again nothing i called today th of december and they told that they will get back to me almost every time they told me that nothing happened and i had to call them his point i dont know what to say anymore i have been treated like a door mat for bt to wipe their feet on and then i was asked to pay for that privilege to be fair their customer services was friendly but next to useless so whats the point would absolutely not recommend even urge you to steer clear if at all possible,Bad,1.0

1255,update after putting this review here below albert quite a capable employee i have treated with several times got in touch and took care of my issues relatively fast compared to the attention i tried to get from when these started a while ago emails calling chatting etc so i am slightly changing my rating even though with the accumulation of time bad energy and money i have wasted with ex toggle i expect more to stay a happy and loyal customer i think the management needs to take action and rethink seriously how this company is operating when there is a problem you need to look at the root march i am only using for low prices and because i move around too much to settle with a contract so i need pay monthly pay as you go i am not surprised that they have such bad ratings the worst about is customer service obviously outsourced and remote with no clue as how to deal with things just following procedures and a script i have nothing against outsourcing as long as i can understand what they are saying and they can understand my issues they know what they are doing they can think outside the box however management is as bad when i complain i receive an email with exactly the same and incapable attitude repeating the same again and again without even reading or understanding as i copy all my chats with customer service and then send it to management the issue is about and no idea how to deal with it i have spent hours trying to deal with things you would think are simple but its like going around in circles you want to bang your head against the wall just the idea of dealing with customer service now irritates me in advance also their system and web is equally inadequate and fails to renew and accept the transaction when i want to update i have given up as the system takes the first card on the list which has expired ages ago and i cant delete that card i have tried many times because i am asked for expired data i dont obviously remember or though i have put a new card in the system chooses the first card on the list which is the expired card and so cannot renew the plan so i have to switch auto renewal to be able to do it manually which guess what doesnt work half of the time for whatever the was with toggle beforehand which took over which customer service have no idea of that either which was equally awful for customer service and probably the same company since the had advantages such as local phone numbers which just disappeared and no one said or knew anything about it no knowledge no understanding in all senses no service and nowadays they dont even answer in the live chat they say hello how may i help you but that is it no answer yes it is cheap but at what the adage here you pay what you get is worth considering,Bad,2.0

1272,internet okay customer service awful fibre broadband service has been fairly reliable it works and there have been service slow downs i accept that and to be fair to them they offered a service that worked most of the time and not normally bad enough for me to they have failed to engage with their customer or be available to speak to the website is currently taking an absolute aeon to load up and therefore doesnt have the bandwidth to cope these are basic things that you should have the provision for if you are an internet company it doesnt bode well if you cant keep your own house in order they are an internet provider after all as a continuing customer you are left out of their favourable new customer deals a common practice with most internet companies contacting them to review the package meant the cost was still higher than other providers but they refused to budge first time around when i complained it was only after they received a cancellation request from my new provider that they agreed to a better price i allowed them to switch it around but i should have left at that point the agent did a good job of turning me time around i am leaving the website is slow i cant speak to an agent via a chat box as its been removed the telephone contact number has been removed from the website any attempts to contact us lead you to a public forum i cant get to that just now as i type as the website wont load its content beyond the talk talk banner minutes have and i am still seeing waiting blinking circles that show that the actual website content is still to be talktalk router does it job fairly well at the moment they offer a talk talk wifi router or a if you want its real model it offers ghz and ghz as you would expect however the interface is clunky and slow its not intuitive at all options that should be grouped together are off on their own branch and its very quirky its a chore to use if you are not bothered about configuring static ip adresses etc then you might not care and it doesnt look as if you can use the router with another provider as the username and password feature used for your broadband are out of reach help our environmentally sound green credentials by adding to the electrical waste mountain thanks talk talktalk tv plus boxes are fairly poorly made ours has been replaced within a year of usage it requires a hard power off to mitigate a range of problems loss of sound frozen video crashed menu interface to name a few worse still if something happens to the box all your recordings are lost you cant back them up and you cant migrate the content to another unit so dont look to the recording feature for treasuring all your viewing pleasure indefinitely ps as i type this the talktalk website still hasnt october i knew my plan was expiring and as i couldnt speak to someone or chat to them i was able to send a message no one got back to me i made it fairly clear what i wanted instead my package went up to its full price being lazy i have let it roll on for months and since then i have had two notifications of price rises i ordered a service with another long after that the love bombing started letters calls and dont leave us emails despite the fact that i was called short chat ensued and then i was asked for data protection information we have two internet with talktalk and offered two addresses and asked the agent to pick which one they were enquiring about i reminded him they were both being cancelled repeated the two addresses that were in question and they refused to pick from my offering which address they were talking about i reminded them they phoned me on my mobile in the end i felt it was too much bother they want me as a customer more than i want them as a broadband supplier and if they are going to be awkward at the stage ill save myself the pain of dealing with them any longer for a substandard is a convenient excuse for many businesses failing to look after its customers but my feeling is that talktalk are looking to reduce the overhead of its customer care team thats based abroad anyway at the expense of being accountable to its customers forum based customer service doesnt work for something you need immediate access topps the website still hasnt loaded,Bad,2.0

1363,in all honesty i can say this of sure there must a few that are getting what they paid for but sadly im not one of them increased billing does not equate to increased service like most providers once youve bitten the bullet and signed up your old news to them and easily forgotten about poor customer service broadband sluggish despite speed increased claims and with optical fiber do we really want to carry on paying for a phone line which never gets any use i could understand the need for a line if it were a modem that needed this kind of connection then theres the tv the basic package is worse than freeview how does this is about change and with the advent of the new privacy bill being passed i will be looking for a cheap internet connection and a good vpn,Bad,2.0

1425,i have been with virgin media for over years under several different companies name originally cable london the service has got worse since i joined they arrange and alter appointment dates without informing you if any outside work need to be done by them or by sub contractors they do not inform you if they can not fix the problem or if they have been to look at the problem this has previously taken months to fix the problem,Bad,2.0
1426,since switching to tesco mobile a few months ago i have not had any caller id its a huge inconvenience to not know who is calling you but also if i miss a call i do not know who tried to reach me or even what number they called from that can have a huge impact on day to life when missing work calls or calls from your childs carer customer service keep telling me its being worked on with no time frame given for getting this fixed regretting changing over to be honest,Bad,2.0

1430,i started using virgin media broadband in september from the get go there was a problem with the wifi slow speeds and a solid red bar on the front light of the router it took months of talking to several employees over the phone to try to get someone to help most of the operators seemed to be from a call centre reading from a script and wouldnt help it took one employee from scotland over the phone to instantly recognise that there was a problem from my description he seemed very knowledgeable and helpful he organised for an engineer to come out who took one look at the router and sad that we definitely needed a new shouldnt have taken that long to fix the problem though ive complained to virgin media several times about this issue and have yet to hear back or offered any sort of compensation,Bad,2.0
1431,vms internet service is very expensive and suffers from problems with dns manipulation and unexplained outages i transmit and receive a lot of data because i help to maintain several foss projects there are times when i need to upload and download large swathes of data and i usually do this in the middle of the night in an effort to avoid the daytime vm randomly disconnect my service often for hours at a time without any warning or explanation for these inconvenient shutdowns also they try to make sections of the internet inaccessible by limiting access to many dns results or by obfuscating them this is also frustrating as many of the foss projects i work on are housed in obscure locations usually on academic am paying an extremely high price for a mbs service but in reality i seldom get anything approaching that data proper ftth services become available here city fibre are installing in the town at the moment vm will probably lose me as a customer,Bad,2.0
1432,delivery of my box happened on time but at no point in the sign up process did it mention that i would need an engineer to install a virgin media box at my home this should be part of the information given with the products specs and certainly during the sign up process on top of this to charge for an engineer seems like a hidden cost i didnt know i was going to incur,Bad,2.0
1433,i have always heard amazing thinks about virgin media and the tivo box like many things in the uk virgin media suffers from an excellent pr power but is unable to deliver on what is is true from the first day i had it installed two young guys in their early s came to install the router the tivo box and the telephone line the telephone line has never work in years that we had it despite being a service i am paying and that i have reported several times nothing has been done by virgin to sort iti expressly requested the router to be installed in the hallway and the tivo in the seating room but the boys decided that wasnt the best location for the router and installed both in the seating room resulting in bad signal on the bedrooms as i imagined it can understand that getting my money is far more relevant to virgin that actually providing a service that i pay for i mean by this that not only is my internet service very underwhelming and in nothing approached to the speeds they publicize but it is very difficult to report issues and to have them dealt in reasonable times i have used sky bt o and other providers and can confirm that is not different but with sky you will have a better service and customer all these reasons i actually believe is the worst cable service i have ever had and not worth the to pounds i have been only will i cancel the service but i will actively make my views clear to anyone who would like advise,Bad,2.0
1434,talktalk company motto is clearly as soon as possible if i could put no stars i would have but the way your questions are worded as long as they are not rude they get stars even though i am unsatisfied with the reply on trustpilot advises me to contact their representatives i have already done this several times am unsatisfied have no resolution hence the review mike talktalk social team,Bad,2.0
1435,really wish i could give zero stars the customer service is non existent we have been unable to access our on line account and therefore our bills for months and in spite of numerous appeals and ultimately a formal we are still locked out no one ever answers the socalled support line all we get is a repeated recorded message stating that there is a limited team on hand to answer calls and directing us to the on line chat service which is always off line and unavailable just been holding on for minutes and still no am pleased to say that at long last we are now able to access our on line and view and download our bills i have therefore added another star but in view of the time and frustration involved just to achieve this basic service i really cant rate the experience any higher as three stars wold be more than oe and it wasnt such a positive experience,Bad,2.0

1505,a good indicator of the quality of a service provider is when something goes wrong and how quickly and efficiently your problem is resolved on that basis talktalk failed after upgrading to fibre optic i was without a broadband connection for days it became very clear that the fault department didnt have a clue what the issue was and appeared to be clutching at straws to find an answer the fact that the fault occurred at the same time as the upgrade should have been a major clue as to where the problem lay during this period of time i was with your line will send an open reach engineer no problem router problem replacement routers neither an outage issue even though the area and timing of the outage didnt match my two separate occasions that a senior manager would call me still waiting for their a manager that someone had pulled the case and put it as open fix without the case being delay was in part due to my fault being unique as i had a business profile as a legacy customer and my profile would require rebuilding amongst other things surely i am not the first customer with a business profile to upgrade to problem was escalated on separate occasions until finally i got my connection restored as each escalation failed to fix my problem i was astounded that i had to wait for yet another hours for a fix rather than the manager concerned making sure that my case was given my connection resumed days and hour after losing connection throughout the days i repeatedly had broken promises and insisting on repeating tests that had been carried out on previous occasions and found not to be the problem for the first days i had to contact talktalk after each hour escalation to get a progress update and only then did an start to consider other options why wait for my call to do something it was only in the last week probably as a result of a letter to the ceo that i had managers being proactive to try and rectify my fault and ensure i was called at prearranged times to advise on progress being made i even got a call a week after the fault was fixed to check everything was working ok why oh why couldnt it have been like that from the beginning i would then be writing to sing their praises as way of compensation i was credited one months i renew my contract when it is up for renewal on the basis of my experiences probably not,Bad,2.0

1516,as wholesale bandwidth prices go down every year virgin media put their prices up every year why do they put the prices up the service doesnt get any better or faster its the same patchy service as always no other broadband supplier i used in the previous years before i used virgin media ever increased their prices why do virgin media do that because effectively they are a monopoly there are very few others that can supply as much bandwidth that they can so virgin media exploit their loyal customers they still charged me the long term price they said they would they would be getting more stars than this they even put the price up during the initial month contract the other underhand thing they do is cloak their own website so you cant see what prices they offer to new customers the only way to find out what prices they charge to new customers is not to use a virgin media line,Bad,2.0

1519,i have been a talktalk customer at my previous place for years and the connection has been relatively stable with a few disruptions here and there i would rate that experience on its own as after moving to a new place talktalk has been extremely slow and ineffective in setting up the new home connection the original date was september and i didnt get any notifications that it would be delayed until that day for two weeks following that ive been only getting there is still unfinished work with the external company they will give us an update in hours now due to lockdown i am working from home and i require a stable internet connection to be effective at work so not having a home internet connection has significantly impacted that talktalk was also unable to give me any estimates of when i would get my internet which made it difficult for me to plan my after almost three weeks an engineer came to set up the connection and said it should connect within hours which it didnt running a service check identified a fault and i received another message that an engineer would check the line so i waited another few days after not receiving any updates i contacted the technical support via live chat and they confirmed that the engineer didnt do the setup correctly after following the supports guide to verify that the router was connected correctly the internet still didnt work they then asked me to get charged for an engineer visit even though it wasnt my responsibility that the original engineer didnt do the setup correctly in the end i cancelled my contract and they told me i would get the fees waived so hopefully that is indeed the case,Bad,2.0

1562,i feel bad leaving a negative review of because up until a month or two ago i would have rated it as five star very recently my g connectivity has been awful the phone will drop to h or h multiple times a day i had thought this may be because my phone is years old and a common strategy that manufacturers use is to slow phones down with every update that comes out in the end they become unusable so that you are forced to buy a new handset iphone were sued for doing this as part of a multiple million dollar law suit but i am suspicious that the practice is so rife that all the manufacturers are doing it my android being no exception i assumed the connectivity issues were caused by this until visitors reported the same problem despite having recently purchased handsets it is my suspicion that the new g roll out is kicking g users off the network and i have had many people mention they are experiencing similar technical issues all over the country i dont really have any choice but to give a two star rating because at present i dont even have a working signal everything goes through the landline sorry v poor show,Bad,2.0
1563,i have been with virgin media for over years under several different companies name originally cable london the service has got worse since i joined they arrange and alter appointment dates without informing you if any outside work need to be done by them or by sub contractors they do not inform you if they can not fix the problem or if they have been to look at the problem this has previously taken months to fix the problem,Bad,2.0
1564,in the last weeks or so had at least days with no tv or internet no compensation or anything as they didnt last longer than days in one outage since o have taken over virgin mobile the signal as been rubbish didnt get a choice to switch or not thinking of leaving as soon as my contract is up and ive been with virgin since virgin media started all those years ago wouldnt recommend at this moment in time,Bad,2.0
1565,i am going to give the overall experience a star rating the reason being is that whilst bt delivered quickly this is more about the bigger product that i ordered arrived on time so well done bt however the product itself is crap and doesnt even work i tried to follow the instructions but they dont even follow the overall not impressed and just in case you wish to know what the product is its a battery charger combined travel case for the bluetooth headset,Bad,2.0
1566,normally i dont tend to write reviews but i would like others to get a fair idea of what happens when they join the first few months were good i had the unlimited goody bag data was ok signal was good as i started to use its data more and more i found my getting slower and slower to the point it constantly buffered and became unusable speed tests show that clearly g service is pegged back to a poor mbps at all the times i tested it g wasnt much better which did surprise me the forums reveal that their traffic shaping in progress but id say it cant be advertised as a g service because its simply not one call quality also became an issue for me and poor reception seemed to become the norm most times i had to switch between g and g which seemed to help but its no good when youre the final thing i would say is that the goody bags are now poor value for money and should sort this quickly the bag wasnt really what i needed and had poor speeds and same issues at the next bundle down but at for gb its not any better data usage is now a normal thing and prices have tumbled across other networks im now moving and would encourage others to consider it that said do allow free texts and calls to other members if you go cheap know its cheap and accept you get what pay for its ok,Bad,2.0

1651,received the router set it up and told we would go live on x date that day came and went with no phone or customer service was nonexistent at the time because it appears to be entirely based in africa and there was civil unrest so all services were took days and multiple bodies to resolve the issue bt was involved road closures to sort and install new overhead wires etc pros been using for around a month it is stable reliable and not had any issues with connectivity the price is very competitive and we were generously compensated for the delay we if the website says you can get xyz internet speed if the previous owner of the property has not had internet you could face lengthy installation delays,Bad,2.0
1652,i got stuck with bt as they have all fibre to the home properties basically i spent years not able to leave them whilst being charged more than double that of other companies for internet that cuts out regularly they ramble on about how fast their service is but in reality its no faster that any other service also every time i move house i get told i have to take out another contract of months but i would have to pay to leave them lets not mention the regular in contract price rises which should actually be illegal if we are stuck in a contract with them i have just now paid over to get out of my contract and will never go back to them ive also lost my email account which i was informed i could keep for month youve actually got to be joking guys my only reason for giving them stars is that on two occasions i have been sent new equipment by them very quickly including a when there wasnt a line at my new property for price contract terms and general customer satisfaction a solid star would be plenty,Bad,2.0
1653,internet is decent drops out occasionally but usually works and so it should for a month be careful if you move home though having spoken to agents and after an hour on the phone i was being told that my contract had restarted when i moved meaning i was locked in at my current high rate after more than an hour on the phone the th agent finally told me it had been incorrectly entered on the system and i wasnt locked in i suspect this happens fairly regularly with the nice side benefit of locking customers in at a high rate poor levels of customer service at the prices for existing customers is unacceptable no mention other than an apology for my wasted time or their ineptitude,Bad,2.0
1654,since moved nothing but problems with either tv or broadband many engaged to fix all say changed this and that and we will run tests again tomorrow or call you tomorrow to check its fixed never called put price up to told thats best price however new customers get far better prices asked to leave and told no we will get someone to call you with offers still waiting for call so looks like its off to sky,Bad,2.0

1657,for the past year they have claimed to have set up my dd only for each month to be sent a text saying payment restricted for nonpayment every month i set up a new direct debit every month the same text however this time i was disconnected without any contact whatsoever and told that there were no notes on their system to suggest that i had attempted to set up a dd after an hour of waiting to be reconnected i was advised that if it happens again they may not reconnect me like it was my error train your staff better then it wont its ok after years of being a loyal customer i am now thinking of going elsewhere not what it used to be,Bad,2.0

1667,the service has become so unreliable wifi constantly waivers and on average speeds are well below what were paying for but wont bore with the data prices going up for a service that claims so much yet fails to deliver having been now told im out of contract which i knew a while a go but recovery from big op was more important to deal with will move to another provider a third of the price for a slower mbps than the so called fast mbps which does not consistently deliver virgin media want your money and more without considering delivering a consistent reliable service in our area they prefer not to talk by keeping you on hold forever whilst the self help instructions are good in part they cannot make up for an overpriced uncaring provider which virgin media seems to have become especially if you have been with them more than a single contract length,Bad,2.0

1736,poor because has a long standing customer i enquired to try get a bit of help due to financial issues sadly i was told no better deal was available currently paying just for internet but a new customer can get the same service much cheaper so obviously no customer loyalty,Bad,2.0
1737,virgin media used to offer great broadband and service however this has waned recently whilst becoming evermore expensive over the last years there have been price increases each year amounting to a total of per month increase per year admittedly part of this is for sky sports sky movies but virgin media are now increasing their price twice lure is that theyll boost your broadband speed for free they cant even get right though the promised dates for the boost keep being pushed back and the current speeds worsen the faults service recently just dont seem to have any a fair person who doesnt mind paying out for quality stuff yet i feel as though virgin media are becoming increasing greedy whilst delivering poorer services,Bad,2.0
1738,broadband down again another issue in the area at present the service is not intermittent the picture is not frozen as we have no like last time virgin media are sorry engineers are apparently working hard to resolve this i look forward to the end of my contract i will not be renewing and hopefully this will be easier to do than those at present are finding when trying to stars mostly it is ok but tardiness too often,Bad,2.0
1739,the first problem is that they make it incredibly difficult to get through to customer second is that they try to extract more money from you at every opportunity their bill is days in advance you can only terminate or renew at days the rate they charge is way more than offered to new third is that their systems are idiotic you are forced towards the website or to text telephone which takes ages to answer then they put you through endless security i believe that the speeds on their fibre broadband are very variable that just shouldnt be the,Bad,2.0

1742,ive went with for one reason when everything works and you dont need to interact with virgin themselves its brilliant however when your interact with them total constant spam calls about upgrades despite on numerous occasions asking for them to stop the really dont allow you to lodge complaints which i find highly shop told me after ordering months in advance that everything would be fine to set up on moving day to new house as it already had virgin incorrect as the other persons package hadnt expired yet and then when it did a further delay as my hardware went interaction on going this week i will go without services for a minimum of three days and after being informed each day it will be rectified at x time tomorrow it hasnt been when asking for further details such as what the problem is no answer and once again trying to lodge a complaint and get an actual complaint number a nightmare,Bad,2.0

1745,first i checked the website found other customers with the same problem followed the advice given there about how to reset the device it didnt work so went to online chat where the agent asked me so everything i had already done before contacting them again it didnt work tbh im not sure if i was talking to a human or ai there looked to be a lot of canned responses which contradicted other at the end of a gruelling minutes the agent invited me to check the website if i had any other issues before contacting them,Bad,2.0

1751,speeds are good but customer services are a bit pants and not happy about the price almost doubling once out of contract if a reasonable monthly price can be offered at discount rate why not just offer that as the normal price also offering a much cheaper price for the same package for new customers only come on nope,Bad,2.0

1753,due to the coronavirus pandemic my home move has been postponed and my broadband is due to be cancelled this week to start at the house i was supposed to be moving into as im working from home its essential that i dont lose internet access so ive been trying to call email live chat with talk talk for hours on end to sort something out and it seems as though they have completely shut down with no way of contacting them i appreciate that we are in the middle of a global pandemic but surely a company such as this should still be able to run somewhat during this time surely they are an essential service providing broadband with so many of us having to work from home right now i feel utterly let down hopeless and this could potentially put my job at risk if im unable to work from home due to no internet access i just cannot fathom how they think its appropriate with so many relying on their services to completely shut their customers out at a time like this to the point where they will not even respond to emails,Bad,2.0
1754,i am a user for a year nowi bought a bundle which is unlimited on everything and also access roaming however when i was in italy data never can you explain this,Bad,2.0

1757,was mislead on price sales agent said it would be for months but failed to tell me that she added a promotional credit that would only last not even a month so my price would increase to so now im stuck in an month contract called customer service and the agent took about minutes to look at my bills when ive only been a customer for about to months so only have or bills on my account the agent said that she was going to add on a credit of for each month till the end of the contract but it hasnt gone one sick of calling and getting off so as soon as my contract is up i will be going with another provider because im also not getting the service i signed up for but you get nowhere with them,Bad,2.0
1758,the internet has been very epileptic in the last few months sometimes no internet at all surely not the fast speed that was service has surely gone downhill,Bad,2.0

1760,further got told i must ring when at hospital i then received a text monday saying the order was being cancelled something to do with tt not being able to provide fibre at our address after all despite city fibre keep sending me letters and leaflets saying including tt and others can i dont know what the reason is but regardless if its cancelled then thats fine for now no need to contact me just dont take my now need to cancel the order and tt are making it very difficult jerking me around tried chat and calling but off ill go to if i had never gone anywhere near just placed an order for full fibre via there were a few hiccups along the way including how it handled having a landline or not i would have preferred to keep the landline over ip but its not a big issue for us we hardly use our landline main thing i dont like is not being able to give an installation date preference ideally for us it would be just before our existing virgin broadband is disconnected to the overlap is minimised i could hold off placing the order but dont want to be without broadband with a gap either if theres then a backlog either way it will need to be mutually convenient fingers crossed the installation goes okay,Bad,2.0

1765,was a happy customer with home telecom for years without complaint until from then on the company has gone down hill dramatically customer service is now poor support call waiting times have increased to around minutes per call and the frequency of these calls has increased to monthly because the broadband continuously slows to next to nothing i had an issue whereby i had no broadband and intermittent landline that took a month to resolve and only did so because i harassed them on a daily basis its a shame to say that things got that bad that i moved my services to talk talk,Bad,2.0

1768,easy to buy and a good price with quick delivery unfortunately i cant get it to work the faqs dont cover the problem and calling the help line just leaves you hanging on and on and on and the claim your call is important to us it clearly isnt that important ill keep trying but not impressed with customer service so for your response the order number is so but i will not be available until saturday now i am trying to pair the device using your method but while it recognises my router at it fails to connect and times out with a message wireless key not recognised check code and try again,Bad,2.0

1772,i have been with talk mobile over years last year my phone was accidently pressing the number multiple times not one or two but ten times like anyways were saying that i had telephoned which is some premium line for road network i said that i had no need for premium rate numbers and i asked if they could block them they said they could and they would disable my ability to telephone premium rate numbers well i always am careful to lock my phone but on this it did not lock and it must of went off in my pocket the same number they took it as dialing which is you it a premium rate number they have charged me twenty quid but when i challenged them the first person said thats weird you have a block but the next person i talked to was a manager and he said he would knock ten quid off anyways i got through to someone else and she said that premium rate numbers was still enabled so if you are with talk mobile dont trust what they say you need it in writing needless to say i am moving to another provider mike,Bad,2.0

1781,i was a sky q user but couldnt wait for the day when virgin networked my street i switched to virgin as soon as i could i was really happy with the wifi speeds offered the additional sports channels and the price a great saving on what i was currently paying however a year into the month contract were thinking of back the wifi drops out regularly my partner and her daughter use g because even when the wifi is working it is too slow on their phones we have tivo boxes in the lounge kitchen and master bedroom however connection between them is poor i need to record the same thing on each box if its important the system itself is clunky strangely some programmes series link however others do system doesnt automatically extend recording when programmes overrun meaning i miss the end unless i programme in a time extension each individual recording needs to be deleted a whole series cant be deleted in one click for example regular unexpected network issues arise error codes include c and c meaning i have to reboot the boxes frequently as im typing alexa has happily announced that the network is disconnected again recently the broadband in our home went down for days engineers came and went without the problem being resolved eventually an engineer who had recently switched from house connections to infrastructure and was working nearby was asked to investigate he resolved the problem this engineer was an absolute diamond if i were virgin id make sure he never leaves encyclopedic knowledge and great customer service skills a real asset to the company unless the reliability dramatically improves in the next months i will not be renewing with virgin,Bad,2.0
1782,absolutely ridiculous company i have no idea how it has stayed afloat from the overwhelming negative feedback they to be absolutely no way of actually getting hold of anyone online trying to find their livechat and message options has been a complete nightmare with no helpful signposts at all on their website other than the continuous then the dreaded calling waiting hours to speak to someone who is a robot reading from a line script of upsell upsell upsell who never understands what the hell youre trying to say anyway then you get transferred over and over before someone hangs up on you will avoid actually helping customers at all cost as there is clearly no way such a massive company can afford to actually fix any of the problems it causes what a ridiculous ask its painfully tragic reading through all these reviews and people still get the bog standard copy and pasted reply from one of the team who still dont really give a crap about their customers,Bad,2.0
1783,the signal often drops completely as i am often for a charity it is unacceptable and makes me look incompetent at home i rarely get more than a bar signal,Bad,2.0
1784,ive now contacted them times over the same problem and i am told that i must contact them again to get the results of tests its amazing that a communications company are apparently unable to either phone or email me with the results hrs wasted on this so far poor show talk talk,Bad,2.0
1785,hard to contact anyone for assistance with network issues most of the time you get through to an automated system that will simply restart the router as if i hadnt tried that already myself there seems to be issues on a monthly basis mostly the loss of network or poor line speed,Bad,2.0
1786,thank you for taking the time to leave your review georgina were extremely sorry to hear about this and for any upset or inconvenience this must have caused unfortunately you are unable to cancel the tariff contract and continue paying for the phone on a monthly basis as they are combined to provide you with your contract and services as you have experienced this means that when you cancel the tariff the entire contract will be cancelled and you will be charged the remaining balance of the contract as an early termination fee listening to your feedback it would appear our concerns management team have previously dealt with your complaint and offered multiple options as part of their final positioning on the matter this is known as a deadlock letter and if you have since chosen to receive off the early termination fees all other offers will no longer be available and the above action will be carried out on the agreement the complaint has been resolved regarding the use of services if a payment is overdue then the services will be restricted and the barring can only be removed again once the owed amount has been paid in full this will explain why it has not been possible to reinstate the services for youto escalate things further and in writing please follow our complaints code of practice,Bad,2.0

1788,ive tried on several different days different times to contact customer service firstly the automated service says if you wish to speak to someone press but it just keeps repeating herself should you be so lucky that it accepts put you through nobody picks up the phone but on the plus side you get to listen to free music i waited many times minutes or so they dont pick up like i said should you be so lucky to even be put through i needed to speak to them regarding new contracts i wanted to take out so they lost a customer however the payg sim works very well its on ee network reliable but who wants a contract if in case of any issues you cant speak to customer services,Bad,2.0

1949,ive been with virgin since in three properties when it works the wifi and tv service is excellent however weve been having ongoing issues for the last months involving the internet and tv dropping out while working from home this is obviously far from ideal we have also had two notifications in the last months informing us of price increases both of which we challenged and virgin backed down from the latest set of challenges have involved broadband outages in weeks we have received no compensation and instead were told that our price was going to increase by month when we called up to contest this price rise given the poor service virgin would not price match to a competitor or even to their own new customer price when asked why they were choosing not to reward loyal customers the woman on the phone told us that we hadnt even been with virgin that long all in all the service has definitely deteriorated and youre sure to get cheaper deals elsewhere while virgin sort themselves out,Bad,2.0

1953,some things they do really well but sadly these dont counteract the things they do badly i have seen my bills increase and increase both my virgin media account tv broadband home phone and my mobile i have been with them for about years despite this when i tried to remove my tv package because frankly they offer very little in addition to what you can get on said this would lock me into a new contract that is frankly outrageous and as a result they have lost me permanently as a customer its a pretty dumb thing to do in my opinion because as a result they have lost not only my business as a virgin media customer but also virgin mobile and guess what i am getting the same for a fraction of the cost added to that their up to mb super fast fibre broadband did not even meet half that every time i did a speed test it was around the high s that is a blatant rip off the provider i have moved to offers a mb fibre broadband and if it drops below mb they will refund that months bill thats what i call putting your money where your mouth is my new sim only contract also gives me more data free calls and unlimited texts for a fraction of what virgin were charging noticed that virgin loves to constantly pat itself on the back but believe me its not deserved over minutes to be answered today on the phone when i shouldnt have needed to phone them in the first place or days ago they sent me a text message which read hi virgin media here weve been trying to contact you about some changes on your account pls txt back the best time date to call you eg wednesday rd of all this text is totally false they have made no attempt to contact me at all no missed calls no voicemail messages left no emails received etc responded with wednesday between and they responded with okay one of our agents will call you at the requested time bye for now virgin they didnt and they didnt the next day they seem to try and make it as difficult as possible to contact them no email for instance why not if they do have email then they deliberately hide it so that its as difficult as possible to you try calling you nearly always get some nonsense message that theyre a bit busier than normal and the wait may be longer than usual or something similar they then suggest calling back later this is extremely irritating and especially when you call back later you get the same either need to employ more staff or they need to have an option for them to call back after all their customers are paying exorbitant fees and should expect excellent im actually glad that they tried to pull the locking me into a new contract stunt because i am now free of them and im going to save a significant amount of money and probably with better service too,Bad,2.0

1955,if virgin actually offered old customers the same deals they do to new customers they might be more respected instead they take old customers for granted increasing their bills their business model is exploitative and assumes customers have no comparable alternative they joining of virgin with old providers with their awful reputation doesnt promise much for the future the speed of internet is okay but frankly after a certain level of mbs is achieved increases are negligible,Bad,2.0

1986,weve been with ttb for years in fact since before ttb and the business side was known as opal telecom ive enjoyed really exceptional call rates with very few routing issues essentially a package but lately the company is driven by machines not people and a really dreadful billing arrangement ive complained many times that the paper bills sent out which most companies still require are issued but not posted for many days the customer us has just days to pay this bill but in many instances the bill arriving through the door is already beyond payment date in fact ive actually had a chaser for payment on a bill a few times now thats arrived before the bill itself customer services in the uk cannot do anything about this since its a credit control problem and guess what thats outsourced to a call centre in the philippines this arrangement is hugely dissapointing and makes no sense at all why cant they get a paper bill out in the post same day its generated why when they know this do they chase for payment its a system gone mad but a package thats good time for a change,Bad,2.0

2046,while the service works it is fine and there are some very good deals out there however the mission statement about existing customers being able to move onto a better deal if they see one is very rarely achieved if the better deal is available on a third party site and includes a boost that you already have you have to remove the boost first and risk losing whatever baseline broadband deal you are currently on while chasing the better deal sometimes one might save over a year with one of these nuanced offers but it is probably not worth the risk of losing the deal you are on and wasting hours of your life on chat trying to get it matched very unfair that some customers are succeeding with this very process while others get it turned down it depends how much you value your own time whether you bother becoming embroiled with this rd may i followed the link for a formal reply and it just took me back to the option of chat etc which is where i had been before talktalk you have all my details already and all the details of the conversation with my account notes you knocked off early this evening so i was not able to follow up and i will not be wasting further time on this in future my current contract expires in august when i will have plenty of time to explore the option of changing provider i am utterly fed up with your chat assistants not matching publicised deals while giving them to a few lucky people as reported on your community forum,Bad,2.0

2079,i am hoping i will need to come back and update this but for now i will share the horrendous first impressions i had with this company and their internet service a few days agoi will compare it to my previous provider to give some dates one would be an engineer doing the work outside the house i did not need to be present for this but they told me the day and time for my own piece of mind they showed up ran the cable under ground fit the box on the outside of the house filled in the holes cleaned up and left the second date was the installation date the install date the engineer was in my property for maybe minutes in that time he fit the box inside the house asked where i wanted the router to go then used his own cable to reach from the box to the router tacking it along the skirting boards and around the door frames to keep it tidy while the router was starting and updating he cleaned up the mess he made from drilling into the wall then waited to allow me to check things were up and running before asking for a signature and then was just date for everything to take place which is ok but less convenient than the above engineer was at my property for little over hours and it was complete shambles he asked if i knew what work needed done i said in general yes but not sure how it would work with already having the box from another provider fitted he said he would put the vodafone box on the other side of the house i dont understand why as that is further from the exchange box and more work but thats what he said needs to be done he ran the cable in the air as opposed to under the ground like the last provider which i dont care about but in the process he spliced aka broke the existing cable leading into the house which means i now no longer have a landline and cant have a landline phone without having to pay some other engineer to rerun a cable to the property instead of putting the cable down the outside of the house in neat straight line in the groove that separates the houses for some reason he it around the windows which is unnecessary and looks awful he did not consult me about this until after everything was fitted so there was never anything i could do about ithe didnt bother to do any checks before deciding where to fit the box so it was only after starting to drill from the outside in that he realized there were pipes in that wall but he had already made the messy zigzag cable so instead of starting over he just slapped the box on the inside in a very inconvenient place he claimed not to have any cables at all so he plugged the router into the box using the cable that comes with the router which is pathetic vodafone provide you with a cable about inches he asked if i was happy with that placement with the router being on the floor in the corner under a radiator on the opposite end of the room from my desk and technology i said no but he claimed not to be able to help with that so i had to use my own cat cable to connect the router to the box even then he did not tack the cable around the wall to keep it tidy just plugged it into the box on the wall and left the entirety of the cable dropping across the living room floor still on the cable thing since i had to use my own cabling for the router i did not have any cat cables on hand to connect my pc to the router so i had to move my entire living room set up to use the microscopic vodafone provided cable to connect my pc to the router to even try and test the engineer saw the light on the router was red indicating it was not working still he asked me for a signature so he could leave i said to him that it isnt working yet is that normal he said no it isnt normal that usually things are up and running as soon as they are connected but that in some cases it can take until midnight then all in all the previous provider was fast efficient accommodating provided cable to connect all devices i needed cleaned up after their work ensured things were running and then vodafone engineer took hours and left me in a position where i needed to clean up after him i needed to go and buy my own cables tack them around the walls myself and on top of all that i had to set up the hub from my old provider just to be able to have any internet access for the first days of this week because the vodafone router took a ridiculous amount of time to actually work despite those days being the billed dates of my quality or more accurately complete lack thereof that vodafone is already showing is making me seriously consider getting out before the grace period ends maybe paying more with another provider is justified if this is the level of service i can expect,Bad,2.0

2103,clearly many of the reviews on this site are fake and created by paid scammers you can tell by the basic grammar many are not from native english language speakers i am an it professional who manages multiple mobile providers on a regular basis my experiences of are generally poor cheap in every sense is is a virtual mobile network in the uk which is carried over the o network o are slowly increasing g coverage over time and have good signal strength indoors and out throughout the uk in that respect you will likely receive good coverage and data speeds no wifi calling is available nor is volte high quality voice calls however customer service is just abysmal clearly the call centres are non uk based staffed by language speakers who do not understand mobile technology and who have difficulty in deviating from script or speaking to someone who knows what needs to be have a strange method of pin activation of initial bundles and mine wasnt recognised requiring customer service and h wait for resolution when this did work for the second time running my bundle didnt auto renew due to payment failure this payment failure i suspect is a problem with how process transactions as the authorisations did not get as far as my bank clearly there continues to be something wrong with their system perhaps they are non compliant with pci dss and online payments service no or volte unreliable customer service website looks like it was designed by a year old with functionality to match,Bad,2.0

2111,ee has to be the most expensive phone provider in the uk i switched to ee following finding a deal through carphone warehouse over years ago and was horrified to find out that when i had paid my phone off after years ee continued to take the same amount from me on a monthly basis despite the fact that the phone had been paid off to my mind as i had paid the cost of the phone i should only have been paying for the usage cost of texts minutes and data after this time therefore my monthly payments should have reduced this amounts to nothing short of theft and i believe that ee is one of the only phone providers in the uk who continues to do this for this reason alone i would never return as a customer to ee their phone contracts in general are also a lot more expensive than other providers for no better service,Bad,2.0

2116,both my phone and broadband are provided by talktalk didnt sign up with talktalk my services were provided by fab company but i ended up here through acquisitions on sunday afternoon nd nov i noticed my broadband sync was intermittent on checking my phone i could just about make out the hidden within the clicks hiss and pops i could dial out but on answer couldnt hold a conversation with the other party when calling in the phone sometimes rang or sometimes went straight to answer phone i reported the fault to talktalk noting that i would be charged for the privilege during the afternoon the noise on the line got worse and the broadband gave up the ghost i suspect i know the cause of the problem are in the process of replacing all of the roadside cabinets in the area in preparation for fibre to the cabinet my issue however is the complete lack of customer service from talktalk and what looks like a cynical attempt to make fault reporting and fault tracking as difficult as possible i am a self employed it contractor specialising in networking i run my business from home luckily for me at present i am working away from home during the week and have phone and broadband access my wife however reported to me on mon rd nov that the phone line was now dead no nothing i called talktalk again being assured i would be charged for the privilege to report this change in symptoms the chap was polite and could see that were investigating but couldnt provide anymore my gripe really starts despite having my email address and my wifes phone number at no time has talktalk attempted to contact us to provide an update on the fault having heard no more and still having no on wed th nov i decided to see if i could get an update without occurring call charges the talktalk business web site seems to be designed to ensure it is impossible to do that although i have a fault reference there is nowhere to get an update the is a send us an email system but it doesnt work it allows you to fill in the fields and then when you attempt to submit it decides to ask another question and scrambles the data moving it into other fields you can then rewrite the fields and again attempt to submit but it does the same again after half an hour and three different browsers i gave up i did eventually find an email address for customer services following a web search it was in a pdf called small business complaints code of practice so i composed an email providing account number fault reference and asked for an update and info on when my contract was due for non renewal i received confirmation of reciept within seconds and have heard nothing since despite the mail twice so here we are days later no phone no broadband and no communication of any done talktalk,Bad,2.0

2165,tescos website looks customer friendly however if you are offered a new contract but are not changing your phone you have to go all round the houses by being sent a new you then have to swap the number on it for your existing number which you of course want to keep this takes time and is unnecessary as customer service staff know and try to be helpful by suggesting the system is changed not sure how many years it will take to achieve this,Bad,2.0

2170,virgin media without a doubt is the best broadband in the country unfortunately the customer service and lack of knowledge when speaking is vastly lacking i had a complaint and after a number of weeks they eventually got back to me and the response was terrible just a sorry can i close the case they are more worried about closing cases than making a customer happy i was a new customer after switching from them a while back and the installation service is a joke and they charge for not coming out it took me ages to get through and speak to someone the phone line was delayed and the person on the phone was rude,Bad,2.0

2172,i cant fault support sales process i was a little choked off that they took the month for meg deal off the table the week it was announced they were installing in my install went smoothly with the exception of a network issue further down the line which meant the install engineer what here for hours not thing i am disappointed about and a reason why i considering cancelling less than a week into my contract is despite what their website says they dont allow you to port forward unless you pay a month extra for a static ip i known this before i would have stayed with bt who came in last minute with a very favourable offer and they allow port forwarding with dynamic external ip addresses so you dont have to pay for a static address at the time of writing the page says we use nat to efficiently assign our ipv address range to our residential customers due to the shortage of ipv addresses some applications may be affected by this eg online gaming pp applications and vpns so you may wish to set up port forwarding it then goes on to describe how to set up port forwarding on the eero devices at no point does it say by the way if you want to do this itll cost you another a month if you needed a static ip address surely it would be mentioned in the review would have been stars for but due to the issue of the on the port forwarding i have had to take stars away as if i do move back to bt there will have been a lot of hassle and wasted time for after one week of use have had major issues with the fibre box not the eero cutting out and getting stuck in a boot cycle every hours only way to fix is to power off and back on fibre box was replaced on thursday but the issue remained an update has been done on the fibre box so time will tell if its fixed again i cant fault support desk tyler i think im just the unlucky one,Bad,2.0

2221,the wording of the order confirmation was a bit worrying the website showed as the item being in stock when i placed this order but the confirmation say if the goods you ordered were in stock and available it gives the impression that the database only holds guesses at your stock levels or unscrupulous business methods are used to get orders for items for which are possibly not in the reason this is very unsettling i requested them to pass this as a complaint to the relevant team and consider this as as a request to modify your wording if the above interpretations are not what was intended please ask them to respond to this suggestion which will give a more positive response to your customers as it stands i am now rather unsettled and wondering if i should cancel this transaction and order from a supplier who can control stock levels and communicate queried the response was the confirmation contains generic wording as many items on our website are not in stock but ordered when requested but nothing about rewording to ease any concerns that customers might than that things went well but responding to parts of the query doesnt leave a good impression how hard is it to be clear about stock availability in the order confirmation it seems that bt shop dont care too much once they have your holly thanks for finding the time to read my opinion on its clearly an attempt at making it look like you care when you dont public relations and damage limitation my order number will make no difference to the underlying issue the problem is the standard order confirmation you send to orders so look at any confirmation sent to anybody giving the order number wont really help anyone but reviewing and the standard text you use would a pr exercise like this wont provide any practical improvement so why dont you review the text used in your standard communication texts and update to clarify the real meaning as thank you for your explanation however by default a standard email would have been sent to me there would seem to be a problem if you cant view your own replies that you send to customers and i even gave an excerpt which gives the confusing phrase you have access to search facilities on your own website somewhere must be a programmer who can access the coding used for your website im beginning to think i see your order number is official notification bt shop order no so incident,Bad,2.0

2257,for the first month i tried out their g service and i can confirm what i read on another review the coverage is poor even in london and it doesnt seem any faster than g when you have from that the sim only g seems ok value and i used that for a few months before finding out that i wasnt allowed to access adult is not a massive problem in itself but i do object to having my data service monitored and intercepted being provided with a restricted data service when i pay for full internet story short their website doesnt work properly so i couldnt switch off the adult restrictions myself and all their customer service would do was assure me that their website to the land of chocolate always give people a chance to correct their mistakes but after a week of arguments and making absolutely no progress i decided it would be better to change suppliers,Bad,2.0

2259,unlike everyone else here i actually always had good dealing with virgin media i was probably one of their first customers long before broadband with old school tv and phone packages they were bad at answering phones quickly when faults happened but always fixed them quickly and were generally great never made a billing mistake and always provided a decent broadband we come to the saga of moving house and cancelling the contract the box to return the boxes wasnt sent until after id moved out to france they refused to accept their equipment back at one of their stores they wont even give you an address to post it to must use our text you but dont respond to your answers you manage to get an online response they still wont tell you an address they promise to send a box to a friend where i can collect it but no hours later a text telling me its going to the house i no longer own is this whilst threats of large bills for the equipment after years i expected more in a few weeks they managed to alienate who judging by every other review here the one happy customer they had,Bad,2.0
2260,i went back to bt after a few years in the wilderness with talk talk i find bt costly but willing to suffer for a quality service but that breaks down when you need help just finding the right phone no is a challenge and getting someone who i can understand in terms of the english language is a challenge the cost benefit analysis doesnt stack up,Bad,2.0
2261,the internet is fast but the router has not reached all rooms and i cant move the router point when i called up virgin would only rent me an extender for a month which is ridiculous when i can buy a similar device for when i was with sky living in a mansion it reached into the back garden and all rooms of the home my current property is a bed terraced so its a bit pathetic the range,Bad,2.0

2279,i moved to from o after a recommendation from a family member but it has not been a good signal quality is terrible particularly at home where people often simply cannot get through to me nor i to irony of this is that they supposedly piggyback off of the o network but i never had such signal problems whilst with oi will be moving to another provider as a signal this unreliable in is just not acceptable,Bad,2.0

2282,agreed to sign up to virgin when they offered a credit to cover early cancellation fee from old provider this appears to be a complete lie to get people to sign up i have just spent almost hours talking to every department within virgin media trying to get this resolved i have resorted to recording conversations as virgin seem to say one thing and then completely deny that was said,Bad,2.0
2283,recently i was sent an email from talk talk explaining the monthly charge was due to increase at the beginning of july the email encourages you if you not happy to change to change to there fixed low price plan with no losses this morning i contacted the service who advised me i would in fact be losing free nighttime and weekend calls no losses she was prepared to transfer me to a loyalty customer advisor which i declined furthermore i discovered my actual contract with talk talk ran out in july of and i was never advised of this i am very disappointed that despite widely advertising they never increase prices they do,Bad,2.0

2289,been a customer for years with no significant problems until recently wifi and broadband way below par and having to constantly reboot router virgin always proclaim kit is working as it should and never send an engineer to investigate further they never update notes on their systems so they cant really track when you have called in i cant wait for current contract to end to go elsewhere,Bad,2.0
2290,i knew before signing up from a local resident group online that virgin media was hit and miss where i live but to save a faster connection than my current deal i signed up anyway it is true though once a week for a few hours usually during peak it is a faltering at best and nonexistent at worst connection apparently its an intermittent fault which clearly isnt being fixed any time soon fortunately my tv is not with virgin so i can still watch something but sometimes i use the lack of broadband as sign that the universe wants me to take an unplug break when it is working it is very good and hd streaming looks great no problems,Bad,2.0

2302,usual rubbish service from talktalk no one to take ownership of issues no sense of customer service or respect for customer loyalty they simply do not seem to care about poor service and loss of network availability etc one of the main problems is that you cannot get hold of anyone who can take overall ownership of issues and see it through just get passed from one dept to another and back again,Bad,2.0

2467,every time i ring the call centre whoever i speak to has difficulty me and i have difficulty understanding them what i consider to be a simple issue takes the operator an inordinately long time to process i called about a fault the phone call took an hour when it could have been much quicker lots of repetition by the operator lots of putting on hold lots of bear with me unhelpful i had a fault the fault was outside the property they knew this and yet kept me on the phone for an hour checking wires inside the router the phone connection etc yet the day before they told me that they could tell that the fault was outside my property because of the tests they had completed when the engineer from came the fault was indeed outside and he fixed it very quickly i was billed for the period without service i was also billed for land line calls during the period of the fault that i did not make because i do not have a physical landline phone connected and never have i rang the call centre and again i was on the phone for an hour because of what seemed to be ineptitude on the part of the will check for minutes at a time sorry bear with me with was your fault it took him minutes to check the dates when i had no service when he eventually got back to me he told me he would re credit great he then said out of courtesy i will refund the cost of the calls but this is a one time only credit when i explained to him that this was a wider concern given that a i had no service during that time and b by checking all of my previous bills he would see i never use the landline service it took him a further minutes to check with someone what i should do he did not seem to understand my concern that if my landline service was vulnerable from outside my property then it needed to be am thoroughly disappointed with the of customer services it is not a good service but then i guess if you pay staff with a pittance in an overseas country youre hardly likely to get quality,Bad,2.0

2470,virgin media are very clever at tying customers into extended contracts if you phone up with a problem they will offer you what appears to be an amazing we had problems with our wifi so we were offered double broadband speed for an extra per month this however did not solve our wifi problem and when i tried to cancel i was told that when i agreed to pay the extra per month i had also agreed a further months contract this is just one example of how they trick customers i am now so wary to speak to any of their operators just be careful what you agree to,Bad,2.0

2472,my broadband drops everyday midday and around every night i have given up complaining but will be looking for a new provider soon,Bad,2.0
2473,i had to contact talktalk as i had tried three times to get my port authorisation code for my mobile i just kept being given the run around or hung up on of course there is never any record of this i had to change to another provider as they started to charge me despite promising it would remain free forever also i have had many issues with my broadband router despite promising to send me the latest router i was sent an older model i have had everything checked at my house from the line to the drop cable bt socket exchange pins and ethernet cables all that is left which could cause my issues is the router you sent me i asked for the latest wi fi hub but was refused point blank without even testing my system that is unless i wished to pay for one at i have just spent over an hour on talk talk chat with no luck in resolving my issues so please do not suggest talking to them again i have always been pleased with my broadband provider talk talk but now they just do not seem to care about loyal customers all i wanted was router that works i have literally replaced every other part of the system and i live next door to the exchange so i know there are no other factors affecting my problem just the router,Bad,2.0

2475,i had been with talktalk for many years and they were ok however trying to cancel my account was a nightmare i didnt have access to my online account so tried calling them after trying more than number i finally appeared to have the right one but had to wait for minutes to actually speak to someone then i was passed from person to person for another minutes eventually someone to help me all seemed well until they continued to charge me for a service even after i had cancelled the direct to the phone finally got a reply and promise of a refund via their text servicei wouldnt recommend talktalk to anyone unless you want to stay with them until you die,Bad,2.0

2477,online agent was friendly and helpful the companys service unfortunately is poor im paying for x mbps bandwidth and i expect a minimum bandwidth of y mbps y x but regularly get much y mbps so if they werent so cheap id ditch them altogether if youre looking for a reliable isp who doesnt lie to you about the minimum bandwidth youre paying for look else noticed that the replies from talktalk on here are always the same yeah like initially contacting them about the issue wasnt good enough we need to repeat the process on their useless forums too off,Bad,2.0
2478,i have had many issues since joining those were resolved after numerous visits and changes to etc and in all fairness virgin admitted i have again experienced outages and with working from home it means using alternative data sources for the signal is poor in areas of the home so signal boosters or pods should be provided to see if it strengthens the connection but they are never offered,Bad,2.0
2479,the wifi is absolutely terrible most of the time occasionally it works and is fantastic but mostly its frustrating intermittent and generally causes stress ive given up speaking to virgin about it as they just fob you off tv services are good overall i pay over a month for a very poor product,Bad,2.0
2480,repeated billing errors all in their favour of course are my experience of this is when you realise why they are cheap the customer service is clunky and with pages of predetermined enquiry topics none of which is relevant to your own problem to justify the reliance on community forums and minimal paid manpower their automated systems need to work reliably and this isnt renewal of goody bag hasnt worked for me either i think theyll be bought out by one of the big operators pretty soon and run as a budget alternative,Bad,2.0

2484,tesco service needs to change there policy in dealing with customers because its poor at best they show no understanding no compassion no empathy dealing with people genuine problems raised to resolve in all aspects am to cap it all off loyalty counts for nothing ie if you change your bundle staying with the company you will still have to pay the remaining of your contract treated just the same way as if you left the company how can be a far policy it wouldnt happen if you were changing with a energy companies but staying with them no wonder they will not win awards for best provider as sky company as hope this helps,Bad,2.0

2619,martin put my mind to rest and was very helpful,Good,4.0
2620,woah why so many bad actually im having a great time with speed with them so far im on the or something like thatthe only issue i dont like is their customer service theyre lovely when you listen through but they risk appearing rude and its not a good look at all i believe theyre not based in the uk but do they actually have a managerial review or something cos it almost seem to me like a lone range environment when speaking to only go for broadband from them so not the tv be ridiculous i dont even think they take their tv if youre a serious cloud downloader streamer and file sharer like some of us you can get any better than virgins make sure you keep your router in a fairly open space,Good,4.0
2621,cannot fault them for coverage price and allowance definitely one of the most competitive companies for monthly sims at least in my opinion my only complaint is the customer service is simply dreadful in certain areas for upgrading my contract to a plan with more data took no more than minutes wonderful however the multiple attempts to cancel my contract being on hold for around an hour each time is simply unacceptable most corner shops are more staffed than their call centres by outward appearance,Good,4.0

2624,after too long of being ripped off by other mobile service providers and there being very little to choose from between the big providers i found prices plans and ethos a great fit and much better suited to my needs than anything that had gone before a lot of the time it feels as if the phone companies monthly plans are build to suit them so you run out of data while rolling over minutes and text messages but genuinely seems built with the consumer in mind while the of the voicemail guy is a little grating and i wish i could easily get rid of voicemail altogether its a small price to pay for the small prices i pay with,Good,4.0

2628,i have been with virgin media since there have been bumps along the way especially with lengthy contracts and a website that needs bug fixing but overall thanks to their own network they allowed me to go past mbps since i signed up with them in whereas bt has still failed to upgrade to full fibre in our area and has no plans until and service representatives are great but there needs to be more agents at the desk as there are long waiting times of do happen but it is pretty rare happening around a couple times a pretty good but could be better,Good,4.0
2629,i was within a few days of my day plan and mobile allowance as running low i didnt receive any notification that it had run out but checking my remaining allowance when i got home showed mb i was unable to text ring or use wifi for a few days which was very frustrating i used messenger through my home wifi asking if this was normal it was not and when they checked my account was unable to explain why,Good,4.0

2637,i moved from bt fibre optic to zen fibre service the broadband speed is pretty much the same but we do find when we have more than one devise working there is some interference particularly if someone is upstairs in the house using a mobile tablet etc however there are benefits as the customer service is exemplary always speaking with people in the uk so no problems being understood and they are very helpful and polite i am not sure the extra expense however is worth it i now pay a month including the telephone service and the same bundle cost half that with bt i may consider shopping around when my annual contract is up,Good,4.0
2638,richard and adam came to our house and where very friendly and where able to help us with the issues we wifi itself is great but the connectivity of it isnt great we are paying for mbps but when doing a test wirelessly the max mbps is around and it has dropped to the s a few times wired through ethernet it gets near enough every time i would recommend this to if i as the lowest speeds we get are still the highest weve ever had and i havent got any complaints other than the wireless connectivity isnt as great as i think it could be would be if wireless was better,Good,4.0
2639,i was handled in a professional way when deciding to renew contract with talktalk,Good,4.0

2651,my only real criticism is that it takes so long to get my calls answered once i get to speak to a person every member of your staff is helpful and courteous sometimes though it can take more than half an hour to get the call answered then if i have to go to another extension or department its another half hour,Good,4.0
2652,bt remote too expensive but well packaged and delivered,Good,4.0
2653,only thing wrong is i have a a phone had it for about months i cannot get it working,Good,4.0

2657,helpful was thorough and helpful in dealing with my problem which was not of making real credit to the company proper human being and not a bot i think which is what was needed thank you,Good,4.0
2658,decided to move to bt mobile having been tempted by recent offers selected one sim only and one sim plus phone equipment arrived as promised then went through the admin process of activating sims and porting our existing nos quite a frustrating process once sims activated we discovered that despite having been quoted as having good signal coverage we had very poor signal in our home case taken up as a complaint by samantha moore at warrington once poor signal confirmed after porting was complete a signal assist box was authorised as foc and sent frustratingly the activation of this took longer than anticipated sam moore kept in frequent contact and chased up progress once active good signal present at home have to compliment samantha moore on her excellent customer service overall process was more complex than anticipated but got there in the end,Good,4.0
2659,the assistant did her best but the store layout and lack of staff made the sale difficult for her,Good,4.0
2660,i have had a reasonable service for a year and any minor issues have been dealt with via online chat without issues the upsell is not too heavy and easy to dismiss the that occurs everywhere these days they are not too persistent thankfully else id have to have had to terminate my contract m about months early rental properties and landlord that decide to huh the early termination fee of around seems quite reasonable id feared the full bill over their is certainly easier than telephoning and being on my new place does not need adsl else id have transferred,Good,4.0
2661,i switched to zen internet after reading which reviews several years ago i needed as i work from home regularly and although they werent the cheapest they scored highly in the areas that mattered to me id rate them on reliability i rarely lose connectivity and speeds are as good as ill ever get until fibre comes to our village their customer service is second to none and technical support is excellent the only downside is the price i think they are really expensive compared with others but i switch in case i wish i hadnt with zen you are on a monthly rolling contract so you are never tied in but everyone else traps you for or months,Good,4.0
2662,fast response but issue not sorted due to more information needed from my end,Good,4.0
2663,like everyone i looked to save money as broadband was increasing in price every year and my fixed contract had ended ages ago i didnt change due to the fact that everytime i change theres problems with connections this year i decided to negotiate price with my existing provider but the person i spoke to had no idea how to deal with it this and the not very good service experienced prompted me to switch i saw vodafone offer on the website and contacted on line to get switch didnt expect getting very quickly as supposed to give existing provide a months notice anyway shortly after purchasing the contract vodafone sent engineer to set up service on we got service immediately on the day no issue so far fingers crossed so much easier and smoother compared to previous experiences with other provider great service so far and cheaper than the former provider,Good,4.0
2664,i like business like approach it is not gimmicky but as with all of them g coverage can be patchy as can phone coverage the problem often happens in built up areas rather than the reverse,Good,4.0
2665,overall excellent service connection speed very happy with services except price increase,Good,4.0
2666,hi there this is something we can take another look at for you if you post on our community well see what we can talktalk,Good,4.0
2667,the product is excellent now that it is working unfortunately due to the lack of any instructions included with the product i initially thought it was reading other reviews i realised that the new remote control needed to be synchronised with the procedure is simple just press three buttons all at the same time the ad sub and bt player buttons for approx seconds until the blue light flashes three times only they had included those simple instructions i would have been saved the inconvenience and confusion and im not alone many people have had the same problem,Good,4.0

2704,a company with friendly helpful and knowledgeable technical support personnel very refreshing,Good,4.0
2705,the service from virgin is satisfactory call handlers have always been polite helpful and professional,Good,4.0
2706,they have been a great service provider to me for years rarely ever lost signal as it seems to be very strong where i live in manchester only reason that i have given them stars overall is because their prices are rather high for what they offer would recommend though,Good,4.0
2707,have been pretty great overall ironically in the last month of my time with them ive had more outages than in the previous years this is obviously an issue that can affect any isp but due to working from home it has caused issues that have affected my ability to work on some days outages normally no more than an hour my only other gripe is the cost i cannot find the communication telling me that the monthly fee was increasing from to and moving to an area without virgin fibre ive found almost identical speeds on offer for nearly half the price but well see if those speeds are as virgin media broadband is very good fast and normally very reliable,Good,4.0
2708,the service provided is everything id expect from a mobile phone company the big plus is the fact that will recommend a cheaper monthly payment if youre not using all the available data calls etc as far as im aware they are the only provider to do this,Good,4.0
2709,very organised nothing is a problem always happy to help and give advice,Good,4.0
2710,there are too many limitations to what you can do within a bundle eg i wanted to join the nhs service called florence but because you cant access a number of only five ie digits i couldnt when i phoned to enquire i was given incorrect info i was told to top up and the excess balance would allow me to access the nhs number nope that didnt work an email enquiry was neither acknowledged or answered customer service leaves a lot to be desired seams to have tanked since the provider a well priced stable service could do better though,Good,4.0
2711,you for your excellent,Good,4.0
2712,some initial difficulties made more difficult by my having to leave the web chat but credit where credits due the problem was eventually pretty swiftly well nearly resolved ive had to reset router twice since im assuming there is work going on but its getting a bit irritating especially as tt are charging me squid for every measly mb of mobile data whilst faults continue,Good,4.0

2726,virgin media would receive a star rating but i am having to update i have the best service or is there one better,Good,4.0
2727,it took time to move to zen and on the date of transfer there were some problems zen mine which took a day or two to resolve during all this the support staff were extremely helpful which is unlike the support i have received from other providers hence notwithstanding the confusion on transfer the support staff at zen were helpful to try to resolve and this has given the high rating however still not a star in that my speed even using fibre optic has declined since the transfer and i did have a faster speed previously although this has been tested and is the maximum available through zen and bt,Good,4.0
2728,connectivity is never an issue it would be good if zen customer service could send individuals such as me an upgraded plan so that i am getting the best available service especially since the launch of your new fibre service,Good,4.0
2729,once installed all elements of my virgini media package work quite well phone line rental is inescapable and obscenely expensive but no different to any other provider the tv package is adequate with loads of channels we never watch but again same as other providers we have mbps broadband connection but this wasnt enough to prevent some spooling and dropped connections on some devices probably due to the router being inefficient and virgin didnt seem keen to offer anything better so i opted for an eero mesh system which works so much better in conjunction with the virgin service is extremely in all virginia media is acceptable and unfortunately there is no alternative at my address,Good,4.0
2730,some initial difficulties made more difficult by my having to leave the web chat but credit where credits due the problem was eventually pretty swiftly well nearly resolved ive had to reset router twice since im assuming there is work going on but its getting a bit irritating especially as tt are charging me squid for every measly mb of mobile data whilst faults continue,Good,4.0
2731,i havent ever given praise to bt so this is a first for me their customer service is without doubt the worst of any company i have ever dealt with however i recently purchased some home hub discs to boost the wifi in my house its years old with half metre thick stone walls so a really difficult task to get good wireless connections these discs worked a treat simple and easy and we now have great coverage everywhere no dead spots service was quick and they are a good price now if you can just sort out your website and telephone customer service,Good,4.0

2736,this review is for a bt big button old cordless phone stopped working after a power cut and as a result i decided to buy a new phone answer machine this unit is large size with big buttons as it is primarily designed for people with poorer eyesight hearing this means that i can easily read the display without my glasses but that the calling number cannot be displayed on one screen as it needs to automatically scroll across the page to be read this is a shame but if it didnt the numbers would have to be smaller and thus defeat the following the instructions to the letter i found set up easy the phone itself is wonderful at blocking scam callers but you do need to take the time to enter your family friends numbers to prevent them being was easy and the phone was promptly dispatched unfortunately it was delivered by royal mail and the box had become dented as not enough care had been given to its delivery this did not however damage the phone units as they are securely packaged inside the outer thing that may help readers to understand some of the other phone reviews is that cordless phones do not seem to require a line filter when you have broadband on the line they work fine by plugging them straight into the line socket corded phones do however require a line filter to be plugged into the line socket first as otherwise they will sound really crackly and you will think the phone is faulty hope this review is of help,Good,4.0

2973,after reading all these bad reviews just after i had ordered my free sim i thought maybe i wont bother then i thought if they try and mess me about they will be in trouble because i would pursue complaints with the authorities so put sim card in went online topped up then texted code for unlimited bundle and that went ok got a data connection which was fast enough to stream movies without buffering in fact i did this all day streaming gb of data which alone has to be worth the tenner compared to other networks calls and texts have all been fine issue i have found is that sometimes it can take a while to get a data connection longest was mins which seems to correlates with peak usage times so a bit of patience is needed there just thinking about it the connection time may also have to do with the amount of data i used in one go as no doubt there is some kind of fair usage for customer service well i cant comment as i have had no need to call them so far one tip when you top up make sure your data is turned off before you do just incase your phone connects straight away and so uses some of the credit for data before you have chance to text code for done a speed test and im getting g mbps download and upload which is faster than my home internet note you will need a g capable phone for that,Good,4.0

3177,having done some research i was looking to buy a western digital external storage device the bt website had the best price and laid out the details of the equipment very clearly easy to order and it looked like quick delivery unfortunately as i ordered on a sunday my payment was not taken until around the next morning my bank regarded this as suspicious and blocked the payment bt came back fairly quickly to let me know so i had to go back and use another credit card that done the package was despatched immediately and delivery was attempted the following day i had no tracking information and did not know the courier was turning up the courier compounded the problem by just putting a card with a reference number through the door with no indication of any action when i tried to track this reference number i was told it did not exist and not knowing what was being delivered i could not go back to bt i tried contacting but absolutely no response i did eventually manage to get into their delivery system and arrange delivery online so bt a great online shop but they need to look at their courier and the tracking of items,Good,4.0

3459,caveat think that you are just going to be able to plug in all your ethernet cables into the router they only give you one ethernet port what they havent told you is that you will need to buy a gigabit ethernet switch and change all your ethernet cables for gigabit rated you use tp link devices around the house they will not work so you can whistle goodbye to you have a video doorbell or wifi security cameras then you probably need to disable the ghz range and reset all your they promised to transfer over your landline number from your old isp a service they charge for then dont be surprised that they fail to do this then offer you a number and give you the aggravation of telling all those important places about the are all things that have happened to me a joe public person not an it expert so just remember caveat broadband speed is as advertised but to get it to your devices expect to have to hard wire them dont expect the mbs via it now appears that both my and other customers comments have reached the ears of the suits on the top floor and plans are afoot to rectify a lot of the problems we have experienced from the conversations i have had you can now expect a short review at the point of sale of your current arrangement and what you are expecting the fibre broadband speed to do for you the website is due to be reorganised with short videos to help in what you may need to do etc plus other plans they have to make the changeover as trouble free as they in all positive changes to come customer services and this new department appear to be doing their utmost for a customers satisfaction my original review was written whilst a little angry and frustrated so after a few weeks of talking to customer services etc to resolve a couple of minor hiccups and the fact that the broadband speed now on my desktop pc is phenominal i am happy to amend my rating to,Good,4.0

3507,i have been a virgin media customer for many years and can honestly say that with a few rare exceptions it has been a service until recently i had all services and all the channels apart from sports and movies because of a change in my circumstances i though i would cancel the tv and just rely on freeview which was already on my tv i wanted to keep the other services though especially the broadband after a chat with their customer services i just downgraded to a very basic package which was more economic that just keeping the other i was glad to keep the tivo box too as i use it a lot to record pause live tv and catch up etc the conversation with customer services was quite pleasant if they were outside the uk then their english was perfect but lets face it some uk accents can be hard to understand and there are people with foreign accents working in the uk centres recently though i have had problems with my wifi not working so there has been no connection to the internet for my ipad phone and kindle and could not print using the wifi printer connecting my desktop pc to a cable was fine though and a recent speed test got over mbps i tried again today resetting the hub and the wifi is now working and a test using that got over mbps this on a saturday afternoon too which is a busy period as im not a gamer streamer or a heavy downloader it is quite good i would just like to mention to all those that are having a go at richard branson he is not the owner of the company just the brand name the company is owned by liberty global a us cable giant so blame them for all the bad things that happen,Good,4.0

3537,i was informed that i was eligible for an early upgrade and due to timing and the online offers decided to upgrade over the website sadly the website is quite flawed in that every time i would attempt to access the upgrade options and select my the website would automatically log me out of my account logging back in directed me back to the my ee page and thus the vicious ensues after mistakenly placing an order for a new contract i wasnt to know i received an email to contact first the process was a little difficult the gent tried to help me through the online process to no avail he was stuck himself plus the offer i wanted a good as new samsung galaxy s was only available online which meant that he couldnt process it himself and then the call dropped out on uson second attempt i was put through to a lovely women named leslie who did absolutely everything she could to fix the issues eventually after a word with her manager she managed to put through the order for me then and there and even knocked off the early upgrade charge for my troubles leslie was extremely apologetic grateful for my patience and i couldnt have asked for a better customer support experience i entered this support process expecting a lengthy yet fruitless result and was immensely pleased to have had such a considerate employee to help me through the process and unlike a great many businesses customer support staff actually provide support and a solution we do lose a star because of the initial issues and catalyst for this experience regarding the website it can be quite difficult to navigate and there is clearly an instrumental flaw in its design as both myself and the staff experienced the same logging out issues for a large company i think this really should be a leslie was fantastic and im immensely grateful she picked up the phone to help me,Good,4.0

3556,update contacted me to day to resolve my issue so moving them up to stars for getting back to me no idea why i was getting transferred to usa the problem for me not getting wifi calling could be my broadband supplier not sure though my company phone which is on ee works with wifi calling and thats connected to broadband but none of the other phones with do so no real idea anyway will see what happens with the what can i say did not even last one dayi think a lucky escape since trying to contact and speaking with some one is the ring a ring of and going around and around with the options buttons trying to actually speak with some one manged to get the option to work and after a short wait of minutes spoke to a lady who informed me i was speaking to usa and that i needed to call the same number again since they could not help me in the uk tried again and again got another lady in the usa who also said i needed to call the number i had called again and then the last time got a nice gentleman who apologised but again i was talking to usa there seems to be a problem as he stated since its been going on for a few days where they are getting uk callers but can not help them anyway where was i ah yea so my issues is that i have no phone signal where i live and it seems that wifi calling is not available on the samsung galaxy j it is normally there on the phone but once the good old sim is installed no option so afraid no good for i only got the sim today i wish to cancel the order but as always a bit concerned since they have my credit card details and i do not want them to keep charging me every month lastly its not too good to have to try for minutes for a simple enquiry and not be able to actually get hold of anyone to help so thats the lucky escape its only when there is an issue where you are able to judge a company and see how good they are and afraid thumbs down from ta ta from me the shortest timed customer you have ever i wonder what the weather was in the usa i should have asked oh well,Good,4.0

3612,item delivered in double quick time very pleased and good price,Good,4.0
3613,ive been with zen since november and everythings gone smoothly with them though as with any isp i do have my little reservations my connection speed quickly became slightly less than i was getting from my previous isp although still not bad and well within the rather conservative speed estimate given to me but when i queried that with tech support the very helpful support person checked and saw that their system had slightly capped my speed because it was interpreting my responsibly switching the router off at night as being a line fault she uncapped the line but advised me to keep the router switched on all the of course is pretty standard but is through wasted electricity and is a policy that i deplore really all isps and network providers should sort things out together so that users would be actually encouraged to switch their routers off for any significant periods of especially overnight without that being interpreted as a line fault they can always email their customers to advise them to leave their router on overnight for a short period while a router firmware update is being rolled was actually pretty satisfied with my previous isp but was encouraged to join zen because of its alleged lifetime fixed price on a contract and my having a static ip included in the price and also a highly reputed router model included i did take that lifetime guarantee with rather a pinch of salt because i couldnt see how they could finance that in the light of changing circumstances and especially rising of course unsurprisingly zen has been compelled to cease offering the lifetime fixed price to new customers because of the soaring inflation but is keeping it for existing customers provided they dont change their package so im okay after all well pretty doubtful about that beyond very my current package is and its inevitable that before long ill be pushed onto a package even though i have no need to upgrade as the service pretty doubtful about what zen would do about that with regard to my lifetime fixed price not at all complaining here because i do think zen is trying to do the best they can afford to do for their customers but it does mean that when the push happens zen may then become less competitive for me so i start looking around at possible rating would be a definite stars but for the limited hours of the technical support service with my previous isp i got an apparently similarly good technical support available so if my line went down outside office hours i could still raise the issue and very likely get it fixed there and then or at the very least get something in motion then for fixing the problem,Good,4.0

3616,i was with o for years and enjoyed a generally good and consistent service from them as a network provider and when contacting customer service however after a price hike late early i decided that i would find another provider because i wasnt happy with the fact that they felt they could change the terms and price of the contract i had with them willy nilly whilst i was bound to the contract word for word for its entire duration i knew they could all do that but i still decided to change out of protest i guess anyway i left o mid to late and decided to jump into a contract with what a mistake that was compared to ee o are great i never had a problem with o network service my queries were always dealt with quickly and my bills were always spot on the price i agreed to pay with the exception of the amount added by the hike of course im not saying they are a star provider by any means they should have adjusted the prices of any new contracts they offered to me when i approached them for an upgrade instead of hiking my bill even if their tcs said they could hike whenever they wanted but my experience with them was just about good enough for them to still scrap stars from me even after that hike or maybe its just because ee are so terrible that theyve literally lowered the bar in terms of what i consider good service who knows in any case ill be back with o as soon as i can be,Good,4.0

3642,i was with vodafone for years the first years i was locked into a very expensive tariff the rd year i just had a sim contract the reason i changed was vodafone is far to expensive for the small tariffs they provide i have to say the only good thing about vodafone is the signal and coverage is very strong and good customer service is only good at solving basic problems anything else they cut you off or pretend to get back to you via email which never arrives a word of advise do not get locked in any long term expensive phone contracts if you can buy your own no sim phone and undertake a rolling you have store card credit card or catalogue which gives you interest free credit between and months purchase your mobile phone this way and not with the phone company if the company upsets you you can cut the service off and move to another phone provider quickly,Good,4.0

3664,have been with zen broadband for over seven years and have never had a problem when i have had to contact zen they have always been quick to answer and always down to earth friendly and helpful and knowledgable one quibble i have at the moment is that after joining talk telephone service about four months ago i still have great difficulty in retrieving the call details etc from the monthly online bill statement far too complicated for example i need to know the mobile numbers because someone else in the household pays for them,Good,4.0
3665,some initial difficulties made more difficult by my having to leave the web chat but credit where credits due the problem was eventually pretty swiftly well nearly resolved ive had to reset router twice since im assuming there is work going on but its getting a bit irritating especially as tt are charging me squid for every measly mb of mobile data whilst faults continue,Good,4.0
3666,so far so good fast internet,Good,4.0
3667,hi for your review great to see you got the support you needed with your query charlotte talktalk social team,Good,4.0
3668,an update on my previous star review i complained about a lack of responsiveness to my enquiries i have now had several responses from zen an apology and a satisfactory explanation for the delay sadly i have decided not to transfer to them because i really want to receive my services by cable rather than the infrastructure so although zen does respond to potential customers i am stuck for the moment with virgin which regards all requests for assistance from customers as an irritant that must at all counts be ignored so my score is about customer service rather than the actual product but thats a very good start,Good,4.0
3669,the customer service advisor was very helpful but i think live chat can make resolving the issue take much longer my chat lasted hours a phone call may have been more efficient as i could not take my laptop into the room with the router as there was no broadband a review of contact options to tailor to the situation is needed,Good,4.0

3678,good service generally and like the way members are so in control of what we spend month to month even on the new contract its still only thing what stop me from giving stars is that smarty give a lot more data for what pay so feel like are at risk of not being as great value i will currently stay though as my kids are on which means they can always get in touch even if no credit,Good,4.0

3699,until about two years ago i really liked because it was a cheap and b had a really simple offer pick a that suited you set to automatic renew but with the ability to switch size on a monthly basis based on your observed usage then they introduced golden alongside standard still not quite sure of the difference between these two types of product and now they have introduced month plans which still allow you to change the equivalent of your size each month how is that different from simply signing up for a as a result the process of picking the best contract for you right sized for the next has now become a complex process with insufficient information provided to convince me that i have picked the right contract for me,Good,4.0

3703,so far zen have been ok thier customer service is better than companies ive been with before as for their broadband speeds and reliability there are some issues with this as sometimes i can get a really good fast speed on both upload and download but i have a speed tester on my mobile and at other times nighttime mainly the speeds have been as low as mbps which isnt what id expect for what iam paying speeds need to be consistent and stable for it to be a good service,Good,4.0

3715,easy step and successful shopping extremely satisfied customer,Good,4.0
3716,i had been a vodafone customer for approximately years but i made the decision to switch to o due to policy of not allowing customers to keep their number when securing a cheaper deal from a supplier this seemed like a clear tactic on their my experience with o was far from satisfactory and i found myself crawling back to vodafone after just one week while contacting vodafone customer services can be a bit of a pain i must admit that their service is consistently good and reliable sometimes reliability is all you really a positive note the brief switch to o allowed me to retain my original number while still securing a cheaper deal through a vodafone supplier since i was no longer transferring my vodafone number from one vodafone contract to another i was able to take advantage of the cost savings,Good,4.0
3717,we had really bad problems immediately after installation but virgin kept refusing to send out an engineer they kept trying to talk us through the problem over the phone but to no avail after about months and numerous phone calls an engineer was sent out and replaced various parts which rectified the problem we now have a good service but occasional lose the signal but this is an area problem sometimes,Good,4.0
3718,i purchased a couple of nest protects and a starter kit very happy with the products great service from bt shop this was a good value purchase that was dispatched without drama and arrived in three days i have made a couple of purchases from the bt shop and have always had a great deal and value for money they never come up on a google search though they are cheaper so when looking for a mew gadget i tend to look at bt first and am not disappointed,Good,4.0
3719,i was happy with the person i spoke with and she was very polite but i am very very unhappy and disappointed with talk talk three years of being tormented with unwanted phone calls although i was ex directory i had a recycled number and they wouldnt change it they blamed routers and five visits from open reach no fault found inside my home yet the wifi signal was half the amount promised by the contract for most of the time router turning off several times in a week over the three years threatening to charge me four hundred pounds if i cancelled the service failing to cancel the so called service and taking money regardless from my when my contract had ended i have lots more to add but i am waiting to get a response from the ombudsman to a larger list of complaints than i have listed here i will be back to add to this,Good,4.0
3720,good customer service changes can be made to your plan with minimum fuss,Good,4.0
3721,theyre alright its just their broadband that im not quite fund with i keep having to restart mine quite frequently,Good,4.0
3722,the problem we had is not solved yet but jordan has been willing to help out wherever he could and has bent over backwards the wait for someone to pick up the phone is frustrating sometimes but the staff are always polite the headsets could be improved they pick up far too much background noise and i can hear everyones conversations jordan has taken extraordinary measures to resolve out issues and just keeps on supporting he usually calls back when he says he will a refreshing change currently pleased i nudged bt out of the way when i swapped although its not been easy sometimes,Good,4.0
3723,the product and purchase no problem the issue is with the setup and app bt have conveniently designed the app just to go through a new complete set up from start to finish in that you have to begin again from i wanted to do was add an extra wont let you do asks you how many discs you have or morei only had one to then when i did try a reset it wouldnt recognise my original main disc in the end i had to give up and use the wifi connect which isnt reliable please bt change your app,Good,4.0
3724,great no fuss and reliable service value was good but recently there are new entrants like smarty who are offering more for the same or lesser cost the other issue is that their g never reaches any decent speeds nevertheless i still prefer the platform comms and reliability so will stick with them they do listen to their customers and adjust accordingly at times,Good,4.0
3725,very good received all the answers to the questions that i asked,Good,4.0
3726,i thought when i left talktalk in july it was during a big promotion for virgin in my area i was talked into changing my provider and i found to my dismay all was not as good as returned to talktalk because i realised that their service was much better,Good,4.0
3727,on a gbp auto for two years no one problem with the service on this two years everywhere that i had being in this two years even better that an company since i could swap antennas and being on roaming to another company sometimes abroad eu on the first time you switch on the mobile you have to force select an operator on roaming to thing to do better when you use all your i think it didnt clear state that you could buy another one and it starts to count again on that moment,Good,4.0

3733,i used asda mobile when they were linked to ee and they were fantastic but since asda went with vodafone they went downhill so i decided to go direct to ee i had no problem setting up my sim but getting the right plan took some doing i wanted the flexible so for some reason they did a credit check which declined i checked my credit file that night and it was perfect so why declined apart from ee had put my wrong dob it was ten years out i was told because of this i could have the per month plan although this was set up i didnt want it and rang back to say you do a which you didnt tell me about i rang back to get it changed to the plan yet i later got two texts saying my has been set up and another saying i had told them i had changed my address neither of these was correct so another phone call this time i got the plan i wanted and so far no problems i have to say although a bit of it was my fault on the first plan he should have mentioned the cheaper one however all three people i dealt with did their very best to put things right my only complaint is i was only told about the dearer plan so far i have no plans to leave them unless i get major problems,Good,4.0
3734,the item bought was value for money however i opted for the fast delivery option which was for delivery within twenty four hours but the item was delivered three days late i contacted both royal mail and bt and am still waiting to receive an explanation,Good,4.0
3735,if i could give zero stars i would during my time with i have had to contact them several times and every time has been just as difficult recently i had my phone and sim stolen and after i very clearly told the staff on the customer service line he informed me that in order to transfer my number to a new provider i either have to order a new sim transfer my number over to this new sim and then text to receive my pac code or i needed to email if i wanted a pac code however after email exchanges i was told that they cannot send the code through email and that i will have to go through the first method detailed above all their staff ever do is lead you round in circles never getting the real problem my issue has since been resolved i still dont really know what the problem was with my situation but i am grateful that they were very keen to help me get it sorted out,Good,4.0

3745,very helpful agents if and when a problem value for money if you get the right plan for yourself,Good,4.0
3746,ive been with for years now they have always had the cheapest and fairest prices in my opinion if you are not using your current data plan to the fullest they will suggest you to take a cheaper option also if you go over your data plan they give you an extra gb or for free so its kind of a win always suggesting others to switch i like the freedom to just change package willy nilly each month i pay a month free text free calls and i think gb of data the only negative ive found is you cant enter text in as this requires credit and these packages technically read your credit and other than that its great signal has never been an issue for me personally it think this is people biggest fear with joining but honestly you wont notice a difference,Good,4.0
3747,ordered the bt baby monitor on as there was a black friday deal on with off which was the cheapest i found it item arrived on monday item wasnt in stock at first so they were awaiting stock from the time i received the email stating my item had been dispatched to the receiving it it was a quick turn around and i found the tracking service easy to use no problems with service and really pleased with discount only thing i would suggest is having more stock of the item as it had only just went onto the deal when i ordered it and already there was no stock thanks,Good,4.0

4348,these days there are a number high quality internet providers isp and to try to pick one out as standing head and shoulders above the rest would be difficult indeed and yet having said that for me the choice is clear for whereas a number of internet service providers offer a reasonable service but what happens when things go wrong you telephone your isp if you can locate the number some person answers and then straight away puts you on hold and then after what could be quite a lengthy wait you are connected to the wrong department and so once again you are waiting at the end of the line fuming then when it seems you have been put through to the correct department you get told that they need to check your line and will call you back and do they call you back not always and so you have to start the service calls all over again my experience of zen internet is that they have a full team of qualified staff who will answer your call politely and with a professional manner and guide you through the various options for getting you back up and running once again if during the course checking your system abd line use etc a technical problem comes up that can not be handled right there and then you might be asked if it is acceptable to hang up and call you back rest assured that this is exactly what will happen zen internet never leave their customers hanging and as soon as a solution has been found often in a matter of minutes you will indeed be called back and step by step will be guided through the method of solving your problem to your complete satisfaction the staff are patient and very polite and quite happy to go over some details again and again until you have it clear in your mind and perhaps more importantly will advise you on the correct procedure to adopt if the problem returns so for me it is this the problem solving that makes me say that zen are leaders in their field and it gives me a good feeling to know that my pc is in safe hands hours x days a week they are quite simply really nice people to deal with,Good,5.0
