0,okay so heres the deal id previously phoned bt to enquire about a second line into the house emphasis on enquire straight off the bat i was treated like an idiot for asking questions that were supposedly answered on the website when in truth the information on the website was unclear and contradictory to what id been told by an online chat advisor after i explained this the staff member then tried to bulldoze me into arranging an engineer visit that may or may not have cost me money at which point i that it was an enquiry and i was hung up on a few months and fibre optic internet has finally arrived in our area bt as usual are running a deal online a month for months plus other service charges i reasonably assumed that this will change in year so i phoned up to ask again im met with short aggravated replies telling me that its on the website and they dont have access to online deals i ask what the price is he replies what do you mean whats the price with an attitude suddenly he figures out that im starting to realize that the price might be more expensive in the long run than just staying with my current provider and he mysteriously gains access to the online prices that hed just rudely told me he knew nothing about and was unable to handle and starts to try and corner me into booking there and then on the phone i bailed phoned sky who offered me a cheaper deal with no fee the lady i spoke to was friendly polite chatty and super helpful gave me all the info i needed even though some of it was super obvious thats what customer service is about bt act like theyre still the only choice thats just not the case any more fix your attitude,Bad,1.0
1,signed up for virgin after being told our estate was eligible for fibre broadband our original installation date was the nd december on that date the engineer turned up to find out she wasnt able to install the service due to the external work not being completed leaving us with no internet at all we have been using a mobile dongle for the past months while we have been messed around on a weekly basis we have been waiting for the blockage in the road to be cleared and reassured it was being worked on to be told today our property is due to the cost but have been contacted since to rearrange the installation appointment the communication is horrendous both externally and internally absolutely avoid at all costs and dont ignore the ridiculously high number of bad reviews unless you enjoy being messed around,Bad,1.0

16,the reviews say it all i am patiently waiting for my two contracts to expire in march and then its off to a better provider ive been with these guys for some years now and whereas i always pay on time and keep my end of the contract vodafone has relentlessly failed to meet its own obligations on every am dreading the switch over to the new provider because i know that vodafone will do everything in its power to complicate the process my fallback will be to switch to a brand new mobile number and let my contact list knowi think vodafone took on a member of the trump family as a strategic customer liaison advisor and all of our complaints and requests for help are just fake news,Bad,1.0
17,i was with vodafone for a year signal has been pretty poor but okay at best however my contract ends on boxing day and i currently have taken another contract out with ee already so much better so i tried to phone a month ago to cancel the vodafone contract to give them a months notice but their systems were down i tried to phone a couple of hours later like they advised and the systems were still down i then tried to phone a few days later and they couldnt hear me a month later im still trying to cancel i phoned today as a last attempt and the systems are conveniently down again and they advised me to call back in a few hours i then tried to log a complaint i couldnt phone because the systems are down and the only other options are live chat or writing a letter of course the systems for live chat are down as well so i couldnt even achieve that writing a letter is useless as i will then owe vodafone another months on top of the extra month i will have to pay this may not sound like a lot but to a student paying two phone contracts on top of rent food life and the other perks that fourth year provides it really is no idea if or how i will eventually manage to cancel my contract i live near no vodafone stores so thanks vodafone and merry christmas,Bad,1.0

19,im really wondering if they could be any worse im warning you do not purchase any device with finance from them one month before the termination of my contract they contacted me to ask weather i want to extend my contract or not i said that im not willing to extend it and i would also like to switch providers they provided me with a pac number valid for days but due to lack of time i didnt switch providers they kept charging me on the next month so i called them to ask for an explanation they said that as long as someone says he wants to switch provider but he finally doesnt we have to keep running the contract i told them ok fine but i said that i want to cancel the contract and as long as you provide a pay as you go sim after the termination of the contract why didnt you just put me as a pay as you go sim they say they dont work this way as many clients after the termination of their contract wish to proceed with a sim plan i said that i do agree with that but youre not only charging the sim but the actual device too which normally is illegal considering the fact that i have already paid my device they say to me thats this is not illegal and thats how it works and that this is stated on their terms and conditions i got really pissed honestly there is nothing left to do for it but i really wanted to say that these guys still your money legally as soon as the rest of my contracts end with them i not going to use them never ever ever again,Bad,1.0

22,i do have a contract phone and no problems with that but i have just tryed to top up a payg phone for a friend with a voucher and they wont let you top up unless you speak to the sales team who are hard faced bordering on aggresive wanting you to change to a contract they say its due to the pandemic they put you through to them at the end of the conversation she said well if you dont want to take my advice what is your voucher number in a snappy tone omg ee sort your staff out before you lose customers if this was my phone i would have left customer service today was beyond zero,Bad,1.0

28,awful customer service quick to take your money and sign you up for a contract but unable to keep their end of the bargain broadband performance is really poor so i was advised i needed to upgrade from m to m with the promise of a hub upgrade no new hub was delivered just a power cable which has made no difference to the performance yet more time wasted on hold with some who doesnt know arthur from martha,Bad,1.0

87,i wish i had cancelled my contract when i had the chance instead of letting them suck me in with an offer to stay put since renewing about months ago i have spent hours and hours phoning vodafone most weeks to try and sort problem after problem that they have caused due to their flawed system and untrained lying staff i renewed my contract and started one for my partner due to the fact im an old customer i was able to get a supposedly good deal whilst waiting for the new handsets they managed to cancel one of them so only sent one out and it was missing the sim card i phoned to find out where the other one was and they told me it had been cancelled for no reason so i had to reorder and wait several more days for the other handset to be sent out they then accidentally swapped my number with my partners instead of just transferring his old number over this meant nobody could contact me for days which was problematic particularly because of my job and i had all his calls to my phone when i contacted them to sort it i didnt get a single apology they said theyd sorted it and it would be fixed within hours and it wasnt so i had to keep phoning and explaining the whole situation again and again because nobody ever left notes about my case then i was billed more than the amount that was agreed and was told theyd have to listen back to previous phone calls to prove what i was saying i was supposed to get a phone call back within working days and i didnt so i again had to get in touch with vodafone to chase them up i was off explaining i hadnt received a call because the call they were trying to find was made over month ago which wasnt true and was just made up as an excuse for not following up my enquiry hoping i wouldnt have remembered the date of the call i have also not been able to access my online account since the problem with my number being swapped and have spoken to various people at vodafone regarding this and all they do is send me an email to reset my password when i have explained multiple times that that doesnt fix the problem i still cant access my account which means i cant view my bills which i need for work i have opted for papered bills since this is my only current option to view them and have had to do this twice as ive been told im opted in and wasnt when they checked on top of this my because the offer they gave me is special because ive been with them for a number of years the system doesnt show my actual plan on the vodafone app as it was agreed instead it shows up as a standard plan which is completely useless because its not what ive agreed to pay there have been various other issues over the last couple of months but i feel this is enough to get the point across dont ever get a contract with vodafone you will waste hours of your life trying to fix their mistakes and it wont get you anywhere because its such a big company you cant ever deal with the same operator to make sure they know your situation and make sure they get it fixed they can just hide behind the fact when you put the phone down they never have to deal with you again awful awful awful company,Bad,1.0

94,i have recently come to the end of a month fast broadband contract with talktalk which has been quite frankly the most unbelievable two years in terms of service speed and reliability the fast broadband was anything but fast quickest speed recorded was mbps download across the two year period internet service often cut out meaning constant resets to the router this in turn slowed down the speed further as talktalk throttle the speed because they assume there is a problem with your line only one device could meaningfully be connected to the router at one time so creating a situation with internet access in the house after countless wasted hours being passed from pillar to post through their online chat services and several attempts to resolve the problems through the tech team solution was pay more for faster internet and then it might get better no guarantees though at the end of my contract i gave my days notice to switch to another internet service provider at this point i was charged an exit fee despite having given the exact days notice up to the contract end date fantastic what a service to anyone reading this who is considering taking out a contract with talktalk save yourself the bother and find another provider thank me later,Bad,1.0

96,no problem with the connection or speed throughout the contract period however have been so appalled by their customer service and lack of business ethics that i was compelled to leave contract m ended and stepped up from gbp to gbp cannot see how this is justified called customer services to see if i could enter into a new m contract currently gbp on their web site but was told this was not possible and the best they could offer was gbp as this is simply not competitive decided to leave after waiting for hours on their chat line decided to phone instead put through to one of their call centres spent half an hour with an operator who spent the entire time desperately trying to persuade me not to leave as i remained adamant was finally told that the person i was speaking to could not handle my request and that i would have to be transferred to someone else was then put through to someone who i think is in the uk this person then offered to let me take out a fresh month contract m for gbp as i see it they first hope you dont notice the step up then put as many road blocks in front of you as possible hoping that you will agree to a fresh contract at a higher price the gbp i had been offered before finally offering you their true best price but this is not available on the web site and will only be given to those few who fight their way to the end of the process and will otherwise leave the process was time consuming and extremely unpleasant had this offer been available to me at the outset i would undoubtedly have stayed but to my mind sharp practices such as these must have consequences i will never consider virgin media again for this reason for those who are still with virgin make sure that when you go out of contract that you do not discuss options via chat or through their call centre insist on being put through to their disconnection team as only they have the discretion to give you the best offers when you do speak to them you might want to ask why this is necessary rather than being clearly and transparently stated on their web just wanted you to know that this morning march i received a call from someone else in virgin media with another offer they offered me gbp and to upgrade me to m the person i spoke to apparently works for a separate department and had no knowledge of what had gone before so now we are down to level of vms marketing hierarchy fabulous offer but not available to you unless you actually have terminated your contract could have said yes but old fashioned as it may be there are still such things as principles perhaps i am naive and all these companies are the same in any event unless vm mend their ways and implement a simple transparent process where the options available to you are known to all i will not deal with them i declined the package and will go with another company albeit for a higher price and lower speeds find myself wandering what their compliance department board ethics committee makes of this anyone involved should be ashamed,Bad,1.0

217,i never normally leave reviews but this one needed to be done we have had a terrible experience with vm especially the hub wifi router we had one replaced months ago due to it over heating and not being able to connect to it the replacement was not better after calling customer services they mentioned that there is no issue with the line and if they send an engineer who cant find a problem then we would have to pay for the call out fee i tried explaining that the issue isnt with the internet going to the router its from the router out to the rest of the house we couldnt even stream the on over mbps even though the router is m away called customer services again and they stated they wouldnt send a new router but they would send pods to give us better wifi if its no good from m away then how could it be better with a pod it still hasnt been delivered and that was a week ago apparently if the issue continues they will send another pod out and so on until they have sent and then they will consider changing the hub at this rate it would be months time if we are lucky i went and paid for a better router and currently use the hub as a modem didnt expect to pay out of my pocket to get the service i initially signed up for our contract runs out in a few months and we will definitely not be renewing with vmi would not recommend any broadband services if they are offering the hub with it i cannot comment on the hub but highly doubt it will be any better overall a bad experience and an extremely poor product,Bad,1.0

298,unfortunately if you have a problem then talk talk will take a very long time to sort out the problem the main issue is that when you call up or do an online chat the people who are responding to you cannot deviate from their set questions therefore you feel like you are speaking to a robot and that your question which could be answered directly with a few sentences takes over half an hour to get absolutely issue for us is that we moved home and transferred our talk talk plan we have been without internet for weeks now and it has been made into an enquiry an engineer has come twice and told us they need to come back unfortunately you cannot book for the engineer to come back you have to phone talk talk back to book the problem is we spend hours trying to at through to someone and then the person runs through a list of questions that are not related to the issue and we are uncertain if an engineer is booked no confirmation email to say that one has been booked for a certain day or time period as stated on the talk talk website very poor customer service,Bad,2.0

416,it speaks volumes that whenever i walk past an ee store the staff always possess the same disheartening look a look brought about by a workplace which knows of only two things draining staff of their soul and its customers of their money a horror story waiting to be transferred to the big screen ee has garnered a reputation for being at the very least questionable when their staff arent promising callers a free ipad in order to land a sale their job interviews are careening over the hour mark assuming you even make it through the gauntlet of trite that is the ee online application form nothing and i mean nothing strikes me as confident about ee as a whole their advertising campaigns rely on s hollywood leatherface kevin bacon to sell a service which clearly not even he would use if given the chance it screams desperate which is ironic given that ees customers are desperate to get a good service as with anything this is a coin and the staff of ee have been known to be either lovely or dense there is no inbetween as stated previously there were a number of staff members who not so long ago pushed the concept of receiving a free ipad with every sale this ofcourse opened the doors of hell for the more honest members of staff who had to clean up the mess that their colleagues had made how nice customers were understandably and petty demanding their free ipad which they would have used for all of minutes before doing everything else on their phone as is common with todays people so is ee bad yes could it be better absolutely will it get better probably not ineptitude fills the air and whilst some of its workers are aiming to do a good job there are others who simply want to see the world burn yet the customers are equally as bad hissing at callers when they dont get their own way and flailing about like a child when they hear the dreaded word no there is no inbetween no grey or middle ground everything about ee is black and white and the sooner you realise and act upon that the closer youll be to even then youll probably find something to complain about,Bad,2.0

482,i got this current ee contract for my daughter it is the first time i have had an ee contract and i think now that it is coming to end it will not be renewed as a phone contract it has done what it needed to like any mobile phone contact the difference in ees case and the reason i will not be renewing comes down to how little choices ee has made in the options offered and how there treat they customers first the yearly rate raises in line with the retail price index just leaves a bad taste it is clearly in the contract but when it comes in every year it just leaves you thinking why i am with a company that thinks this is acceptable no ones wages go up in line with the rpi all that is expected when you set a price in year contract it should stay at that originally price for the years secondly there is no option to block picture messaging at the network level over the years mobile phone companys have had they bag of tricks for hiding charges which inadvertently bring in a big bill for the unaware user limited the last one of these is picture messaging luckily most mobile phone companys provide network level options to avoid this but not ee my daughter has accidently run up two big bills which again due to ees decision not to provide the option to block has left my feeling abused and tricked these may seem minor reasons but there are plenty of other mobile phone companys which dont do this and that is why ee will not be getting my further business so ee you may have got roughly in extra charges over the last years but you have now lost a customer who could have been buying mobile phones from you for the next this what has happened with my other provider has always lived upto expectations and any issues have been resolved to my satisfaction never had a rate rise only increased allowances for the same money and as a result they have kept my business for a decade ee you have a lot to learn,Bad,2.0

489,i originally had a very good impression of virgin but they are dead set on getting rid of that ive been a customer with them now for around currently with virgin media as a business customer after paying a large refundable deposit when first purchasing i had to first remind them months after i was supposed to be credited having been credited i was then to have a zero balance bill until my credit was virgin have for the second time now suspended services due to nonpayment of a bill despite them having plenty of my was sold the services on the basis that business customers are a high priority and i could expect faults to be rectified within hours or have a backup usb device they suspended services at pm on friday just when the customer service lines close for the weekend the technical support team are based oversea and youd honestly get more help flagging down a random passerby and just asking a weekend without internet as a result of their account mismanagement for the second the connection itself has odd flaky times that require reporting a fault most services work however ill start getting a lot of dropped packets making the connection useless for applications when it does work though it is fast and mostly the multiple occasions the internet has failed the backup g usb device meant to keep you connected also goes down at least according to the tech team when asked to switch it on thats also another department that only operates between i wasnt a customer it would actually be quite comical how badly everything is implemented they actually feel like the faulty towers of internet providers account suspensions at a time you cant get it fixed for over hours a backup g usb device that only seems to work if the virgin connection itself is ok and the most egregious account management so poor it severely impacts the operation of my have so far been unable to successfully have a formal complaint acknowledged and addressed and due to further account issues on their end its very difficult to raise a new one escalate and existing to the point ive now contacted a ombudsman at least the cost of ending the contract early should mostly be covered by summary particularly if your business is reliant on a good connection virgin media are currently not a good choice based on my experiences and they have some relatively simple issues that need immediate attention,Bad,2.0

505,coverage id argue that the coverage overall is good at least in london where i live i find that the signal tends to float between bars but usually ee are pumping ridiculously fast speed into the phone mast to make up for low signal however their coverage indoors for me is their major weak point although they have wifi calling not everywhere i go inside has wifi so id recommend you to go for or one of their if you need g bars indoors edit the main reason for this is that ee use shortwave frequencies where i live which is optimised for speed but will have trouble penetrating thick be honest i cant really fault them the only caveat has to be the waiting time of my last couple transactions with them but thats to be expected because we are in a theyre actually quite alright just the weak indoor signal that bugs me but we cant have everything we want in life i guess,Good,4.0

581,i realised we needed something more than the old range extender we have been using when we found out that we could not get netflix to work on our main tv and continue to use our wireless printer too far apart so we needed to invest in something like the bt whole home wifi system the only problem was deciding which one and how many discs the website was not really all that helpful that could be improved i made a finger in the air choice and the one we have chosen dual band three discs is easily good enough so i am not unhappy with it maybe a lesser system would have been ok setting up was not too much trouble although it did require one phone call we can now get better than mbs download speed throughout our large house well done to the technology,Good,4.0

675,ive used zen for almost years now and the service has until recently been very good the technical support is excellent and has been able to fix all the issues weve had on our very poor adsl line we now have available and i would like to upgrade but unlike the tech support i have found the service department very unhelpful and inflexible to be a longstanding client seems to count for little or nothing i hope they remember that its easier to retain existing clients than to find new ones otherwise theyll start losing clients in this competitive world me included though january i had a very prompt and helpful response that has addressed the problems i was having with zen im glad to say as i did not want to have to go through the inconvenience of changing isp as i said before their tech support was and is simply the best in my experience so i guess hope this problem with their sales dept was just a temporary problem its also encouraging to note that these reviews are watched by quality assurance manager and that they do react to comments quickly and attempt to remedy any issues,Good,4.0
676,although the agent wendy did her best to help with our problem she was unable to but she didi try,Good,4.0
