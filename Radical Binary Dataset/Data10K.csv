10,issue i have been with talk talk going onto months and the service and is dreadful when i first set up my dd with the customer service rep she asked for a date that i would want my the dd to be taken on i gave her date i then realised that the original agreed date was not the date that had been selected and my dd was being taken earlier than i agreed or expected i then called up to ask why i was informed me that talk talk had their own selected dates they take dd on which i wasnt informed on orginally which was frustrating as that meant money had been taken before it was there to be taken which also meant late fees was because of late payments when asking customer service rep to change the date she told me and i quote dont worry about changing the date let the payment bounce as talk talk will try again days later which is terrible advice from your customer service rep and expected i ignored that advice and changed my dd date issue i have been without internet for a month now and have called up times now spending over a hour on each call doing the same requested things and each time it has not worked then to have another modem and router sent out for that also not work i called up again for th time to spend another hour on a call to do the same thing again but now i have been booked in for the repair team which is coming up this week friday and also waiting for a complaints manager to call me back as i refuse to pay for a service that i havent joke,Bad

14,if i could give this company stars i started a new contract on a wifi hub was sent to me but talktalk put an incomplete address on it and thus it was by contacted talktalk who told me that they had rectified the problem however advised that they had not and they returned the hub to contacted them today to tell them that i needed a new hub to be sent out and after minutes of being on chat to them after eventually finding the facility on their website i was told that he wanted to firstly transfer me to technical department as he thinks there is a fault there isnt the fault is that it wasnt delivered then he said he was going to charge me to get the router delivered to me unbelievably shocking,Bad

24,i pay for broadband service virgin connected us to the neighbours property the neighbours complained about their split signal they got virgin to disconnect us i am now without internet until the cabling to our property is finally properly sorted while still paying for a service and finding myself with no internet connection for days which is highly problematic for me virgin have to much power and no work ethics or sense of service its a huge ma june unable to deliver the service they promised and should not have such a share of the market to avoid whenever possible,Bad
25,where do you even begin my partner has been in contact with virgin medias customer service line times and still we have gotten nowhere in fact our internet is now worse than when we first got in have sent us two new routers to see if that would help it didnt after many more phone call attempts they finally sent a technician he was a very friendly man but he made our connection worse somehow and now we cannot get through to virgin media at all we have to listen to that god awful hold music for over an hour with the same two songs just for them to hang up at the end of it this is the most appalling customer service ever it honestly feels like a scam i am paying money for a service i am not getting never ever go with virgin media,Bad
26,how does bt stay in business i have never come across such incompetence the last months installation business and residential have been disasters they are unable to deliver equipment on my ongoing installation we have shipments of goods router etc to the same incorrect address the second shipments were to rectify the previous errors and were still sent to the incorrect address and each time hour and hours respectively were spent on online chat and phone sorting out the correct installation has changed dates constantly hopefully it will eventually installed as the last instalment took one hour a day on the phone for months after the installation appointment which apparently isnt an appointment but a rough ides of when they might want to turn upi could go on but its pointless just like bt so as soon as the installation is complete i will be cancelling all of our contracts with bt due to incompetence,Bad
27,i would like to say that this review is my own personal experience and should not be taken as being indicative of the general level of service that people will receive from virgini moved to virgin from sky during october last year and for me this was probably one of the worst mistakes i have ever made the customer service has been very poor i was unable to use my second box from october to february and it was discovered that the engineer had fitted the box incorrectly on realisation of the mistake i never received so much as a also joined virgin mobile at the same time as joining and virgin media and when my details were passed from the media to the mobile team the mobile team took my name down incorrectly weeks passed during which i had to prove my own identity with associated documentary proof yet again not even a sorry we have been unable to use the in demand service for several months this was fixed by an engineer but yet again not even and apology yet i have been paying in full for the whole duration of the i joined i was advised that i was taking the maximum bundle which came with a mb broadband connection i really wanted the tb connection but as there wasnt a package for that they advised me that i would be automatically upgraded to the tb service free of charge in a couple of months this is what persuaded me to join but alas that was apparently not true when i challenged virgin who can listen to the call transcripts they just dismissed my issue there are so many more instances of poor service i could really go on this is a real shame because virgin have always advocated themselves as having high customer service but in reality the customer service is as poor in my own experience as their tv and broadband service which is a real shame i used to be with virgin years ago their service was simply too notch i really dont know why this has changed this could all be due to the impacts of reduced staffing levels associated with coronavirus which is understandable but a simple apology would go a long way,Bad
28,few months down the line i still cant access my online account amazon voucher pure scam beware im still waiting to receive it for over half a service is rude unprofessional trying to send me from one agent to another bcz they dont want to solve a problem which is their responsibility,Bad

30,absolutely appalling treatment renewal account i have always rated virgin media products and customer service as brilliant im so disappointed that ive have had to change provider and have worse tv service as my indoor aerial is not great hence loving the fibre optic option there was no way i could continue to pay for such poor service ive been waiting months for a call back from a manager and even longer for promised call backs from customer services they have the nerve to keep calling me to pay even though they have not adhered to their part of the contract i have always paid on time with no issues i have been lied to on numerous occasions by the customer services i would avoid this company and save yourselves stress disappointment and bad service,Bad
31,just got off the phone with vodafone customer services after calling them to ask why my phone was still connected after i had called them on th november to cancel my contract and to give my days notice if i hadnt have been checking if my phone was still live and if another months pay for the contract had come out i would still be paying for a phone that i no longer used it took a minutes telephone conversation and being passed to five telephone operators to sort out the mess and even now its still not sorted theyve now said an investigation will be carried out to listen to my previous phone conversation to see if it was actually agreed that i was giving my days notice only on proving this will i get my money back its absolutely disgraceful considering ive been with them since,Bad
32,only give one star because i could not give joined talk talk at the beginning of march from sky the biggest mistake of my day one it was a total disaster broadband kept going down every days contacted technical support over times in weeks i was with time i was pushed from india to manila then to south africa then back to manila and eventually ended up where i started in india and still no decided to give them days to get it sorted i heard every excuse you could possibly think of all got the same customer service manual i can recite it word for i told them i was leaving each time i called them i told them i wanted it logged and a refund for the broadband downtime which i eventually left without any early termination charges i signed up with zen it was a bit more expensive but worked from day one and customer service its like i have been released from my well away from talk talk thats all they do talk they never fix anything bunch of cowboys,Bad
33,when i was my mum took a contract in her name for myself after turning i decided i wanted to get a contract of my own i went into the inverness branch to see if i should start up a brand new contract for myself or just transfer my mums one over to my name and bank details from this i was told that it would be easier to just transfer over the name and bank details so after doing this and paying an upfront cost of i was told my phone should arrive days after i ordered it after two days my new iphone still hadnt of arrived to this i phoned customer service to be told there was different bank details to the phone holders name i then went into the store so they wiped my bank details off of the account my mums name was still on the account when id of previously ordered my new phone i was told to change the ownership month after i had payed my first instalment so then today i phoned again to reinstate my bank details with my mums permission to be told my order had of been cancelled and i would need to replace my order remembering that this was suppose to be the easiest way of updating my contract i am now about to go abroad with no upgraded phone deeply saddened by the customer service due to being giving what had to be the most difficult way of getting a phone contract,Bad
34,military family who have had to move absolutely no empathy or customer service for not having virgin available in our new postcode how is it possible that you charge us for a service that you cannot provide we had to move from sky last time and they were brilliant and were just apologetic that they could no longer be our provider you should be ashamed that you cannot help it families in a tough time and then you had the cheek to say that if i recommended you to a member you would take from the charge are you actually joking for the first months our bill was wrong and it took hours on hold to rectify each time now you are charging us to leave from a service you can no longer provide terrible terrible company do not go with virgin,Bad
35,very bad service will try to scam you into paying for an engineer visit then tell you that you dont require one they will then ask you to pay another for their own billing errors issues for months with no engineer visit expect me to have the technical know how to fix network at all and to use personal hotspot through mobile phone instead of broadband i cannot believe that my mobile phone provides better internet than are better off buying a sim card and using a mobile phone as router hotspot trust me and dont get locked into a contract that ignores you once they have setup a direct debit,Bad
36,the most inappropriate broadband provider ever they so illiterate that after calling times they cannot resolve and issue requested to speak to manager but apparently they cannot locate any in the such big established call centre its a joke of a company the workers dont have a clue they all thick all they know is how to do security and then they so rude they put u on hold forever and dont come back to u so u hang up absolutely hilarious please do not go with this company stick with anything but this i dont even rate a star but unfortunately to write a review they make u add one haha is time service they can even do gdpr properly also cannot hear you first time they need to be not efficient and professional,Bad
37,like most of the reviewers would like give zero stars unfortunately in an agreement till june seems they raise prices as they wish service is patchy wifi seizes and there customer service is terrible i feel sorry for the agents they must get fed up of all the complaints and the fact vm dont have any desire to fix as long as the money comes in,Bad
38,contacted talktalk due to very slow internet which caused issues for our business they basically said that the speed issue was on our end and they would send us a wifi hub but that everything was fine on there end after the chat i check the speed and notice it suddenly gone up thought still not as it should be i was told by the advisor that we are heavy users and this is probably the problem and not them and then its suddenly improved feeling as if they havent been very honest and truly unhappy with their service looking for another provider asap,Bad
39,unfortunately i found the customer service team far from competent today times i told the agent i use a wired connection and was with patronising questions no acknowledgement of my answers and a minuet conversation about my wifi connection router direction and distance the router is from my pc as all of these could effect the quality of my wifi connection more than happy to send logs of the conversion to talktalk management if contacted,Bad
40,once again broadband and tv not working phoned virgin to report fault and get through to call centre abroad cannot understand what agent is saying owing to strong accent waste of time,Bad
41,if i could give a zero i would goes off nearly every half hour ten to mins a time worse internet ever disconnects all the time rubbish dont bother with it,Bad
42,simply asked to make sure my account was terminated on my contract end date got passed around to different departments asked the same questions and then had the chat forcibly terminated when i asked a simple question,Bad
43,talktalk sent several engineers to my house to check what is the problem with my broadband which was constantly although from the first visit was more than clear that the problem is outside my house and also the problem with the broadband speed which is fare low than the one promised when i joined talktalk,Bad
44,please find an alternative broadband provider to cant comprehend how companies as large as talktalk and are so inept and been without broadband for days now and they cant manage to book and engineer between them ive spent nearly hours on the phone over the last day and wasted half a day off waiting for an engineer not to turn upi only scored star as isnt urge you not to use talktalk,Bad
45,i have a leased line with this company and they are constantly threatening with you have to pay the full balance even when the industrial building we are moving out of so no longer require the broadband due to downsizing vm have advised i have to pay approx due to the early out of contract disconnection which is wrong everywhere online states if you are moving to another location already has broadband and does not require a leased line at all would be total overkill and price a month definitely no bad service from vm have not even mentioned the bad network we received,Bad
46,i topped up my friday lucky only but today they have cut off my number and try to calling them on they number on website but that can not be connected thats down but did some digging on goggle and found out its the same address as delight to call them about it on the number on they website but same dose not work lucky again paid by paypal so will open case with them about it tomorrow if do not get a message back about this rip off they have mobile have given you this info on your facebook account but you said they same thing they but still waiting for call after given you it you tell me why the number on your website dose not work scam thats have taken my money then cut off my i will be reporting it to paypal this is fraud so will be reporting this to fraud action on line as i have found out that you are the same company as delight mobilemy advise stay away from both companies,Bad
47,cannot advise against virgin media enough poor speeds and wifi coverage from the router aside if youre forced to move house within your month contract and they cant supply your new property which is likely as they only have coverage in the uk they will charge for cancellation fee not sure how this legal this is but it certainly is immoral have a quick goggle both bbc and the guardian have reported on the corrupt charges their support is terrible or non existent if you do get through to customer services they are likely to hang up on you i live in small bed flat in london and i still needed a booster to get full coverage which i had to pay a month for the privilege and still wasnt enough but i was too fatigued by their terrible customer service to try and rectify any further,Bad
48,repeated calls to customer service yet unable to install app they finally told me that i had to contact android and that my agreement with tm was for data messages and line only i have suggested we agree to termination of the contract but have been told verbally that will not happen i await the reply below its a pity the staff do not know this instead they told me to visit my local store where they refused to touch my phone following the company protocol for i do not use facebook or twitter it would be so much easier just to agree to termination of the agreement,Bad
49,i wish i could give stars my year old brother received a cold gdpr plus hes registered on tps which i done myself for him and he didnt understand why they were calling so i took over the call and questioned the female agent on whats the reason for the call and why is she contacting a year old and the attitude i had back was horrendous she demanded for me to tell her if she was speaking to the correct brother which he had already told her that she was speaking to the correct person and then said that i need to watch what websites he goes on because hes applied for a phone contract and that she was phoning to set it up im the one that pays for his phone contract so why would he want to take out his own and hes not old enough plus were with ee which wouldnt ever speak to any potential customer the way i was spoken to i rung back to ask for the name of the agent i spoke to and for the manager and the second agent i spoke to did not know how to handle the call at all he seemed very confused on why i was calling back after i explained times absolutely horrendous customer service and im not even a customer,Bad
50,very bad customer service agents do not understand anything when you talk to them do not go with this provider i have had nothing but trouble and it never gets resolved due to a lack of understanding by the agents,Bad
51,broadband goes down too often first virgin advisor told me they were making it intermittent as i had used too much it is unlimited i am fed up having to check cables and reboot now saying it is down in the area again if you are looking for reliable broadband dont choose virgin good service when it works but when it doesnt the customer service advisors just transfer you to different department when they dont know what to do no explanation why it keeps going down for hours at a time,Bad
52,absolutely diabolical at the start of march i asked bt for internet and a phone line its now june th and after unknown unexplained cancellations i told them to just cancel everything the best thing is months for me of nothing but within hours theyd sent me a returns pack seems like they just wanted to get rid of me the way they have treated me is appalling they never told me about any of the cancellations and ive lost days as well as my son were both disabled and they just dont care i wouldnt trust them as far as i could throw them,Bad
53,just awful dreadful company cancelled my contact and months of chasing they still owe me money customer services dont the question and im sent round in circles im not leaving it as i think its disgusting they are putting off refunding what i am owed i would never have anything to do with virgin reply you sent is a waste of time ive tried different ways to context and no staff are well trained enough to sort it,Bad
54,i have a mobile provided by my employer with an ee sim coverage is terrible i found i had almost no signal anywhere in shropshire even when in town i live in a market town in wiltshire and again lucky to get bars anywhere in the county outside of swindon everything everywhere more like practically nothing anywhere,Bad
55,dreadful awful you ask questions and do not allow time to find an answer i still do not know the answer to my question which was why are you disconnecting my internet connection,Bad
56,waiting since october to get broadband installed here we are months later and about phone calls later still not installed was meant to get an update from vodafone at noon today yet another failure from vodafone between vodafone and city fibre they are both not worthy of star,Bad
57,since day one there has been issues you failed to update your direct debit details eventhough i provided these details to your team on separate occasions then followed issues with static ip wasting my time disrupting my business and causing an unstable connection when static ip was removed i was getting around mb on average on a mb connection at times at peak times i was getting about mb and sometimes even as low as mb or faults raised customer service wouldnt compensate me for the issues you have caused to my business until the fault was resolved i thought the fault was finally resolved and so i chose to upgrade to a better haha connection with mb down to this day i have heard every excuse in the book from your team and they even said my laptop was at fault the issues have been an ongoing saga longer than star wars and lord of the rings having issue after issue i spoke to david levy who promised a callback in h days later and still not able to speak to a manager today alone i was on the phone with your team for almost hours most of that time i was on hold only when i got through did they say to put a pin in the back of the router to factory reset it to receive the firmware update the firmware update did not work so i am now in the queue to have this update forced on the router they also forced me to use the static ip option as this was the quickest way to get this resolved so what about all the other customers who dont have static ip and need the update well you have to get an engineer booked in to come to your property and sort it i of had port forwarding or custom setup on the router it would have wiped all that out and i would have had to redo it all wasting even more time you need to have a better way of pushing out firmware updates if not look into i feel like virgin media business is being run by a bunch of clowns youve not been able to fix this fault within months and i would not recommend you to anyone after this shocking and unacceptable experience we are at present paying double what we were for the mb package and we are getting no more than mb highest on wifi when at a relatives on virgin media residential using the super hub on wireless i get about mb down no has caused great disruption to my business and instead of helping its been the worst experience with an internet service provider i have ever had,Bad
58,the number worst service company in the had a contract with them for months and every few months they increased the charges by just like that when i called customer service they say they we dont know why is that but here is the may think its a one time but no it happened every few months until i asked to cancel the contract which they took the plenty fee of away from virgin media they are thieves,Bad
59,i would not recommend o to anyone and certainly not for anyone looking for multiple family phones or wanting a phone for someone with disabilities they have absolutely no idea on how to treat people with disabilities with terrible customer servicethe online myo is just as useless wish i had stayed with and will certainly be looking for a new provider as soon as i can,Bad
60,made a mistake and wouldnt correct it couldnt speak to a manager to resolve the situation very unhelpful and rude wouldnt recommend,Bad
61,stupidly thought we had a better deal on infinity than sky fibre so decided to switch got a date of as switchover date and an engineer between and so all good or so we thought came and i decided to have an online chat along the lines of why i had no broadband and no engineer in the time allocated advisors didnt seem to know then a little message appeared of may i call you now which immediately made me realise all was not well apparently there was an issue with the systems that the order i placed weeks prior hadnt been processed properly despite getting the bt sport ok and the router delivered might be next wednesday when you get wifi switched on but just go and buy a dongle and well pay you back was the message i expressed my disgust at the lack of communication and inept service but thought i would give them a chance to redeem enough this morning at am an engineer bangs on the door no comms to say they were coming of course changed a worn out corroded part outside and points inside and said it was just a case of waiting for the cabinet to be flicked our surprise then when at we got an email saying sorry to see you go youve cancelled your subscription with another call this time minutes of nobody knowing what had happened when finally they called to discover it was them who had cancelled the entire order phone bt sport sim deal and infinity the lot the story goes that we couldnt have fibre broadband at our property but they could offer standard broadband only i pointed out that i was on sky fibre unlimited and to what part of her brain that seemed like a good consumer deal only for some more umm err hmm to go on i declined the offer and immediately got on to sky to reinstate my service the advisor of course professionally chuckling at their competitors to see tomorrow if these fools can actually do something right and complete the cancellation with no aggro the hub will be getting launched back to them asap and i will never again be so foolish to even consider any offers from this poor excuse for a business ever again if this helps you make up your mind of switching i hope you choose wisely and stay well away from them it will save you much time and getting wound up because this lot simply dont seem bothered,Bad
62,shocking customer service and product design i get phone broadband and tv from them a week after i purchased a mobile phone it was smashed unlike better providers bt dont repair mobiles and could offer me no alternative solution except a suggestion to claim on my home insurance dont be fooled by the bt name youre much better off going with a proper mobile company like vodafone or o,Bad
63,this is the worst company i have ever had to deal locked me into a dongle contact it never worked properly and when i asked to cancel they refused saying i needed to pay to terminate then when my my contract ended they tricked me into another yrs of payments for something i have never used,Bad

76,the mobile staff are not interested in what the client is asking them to check i queried how data could be used when my mobile was switched off and the usage times on the account were very late at night midnight or before i was awake in the morning i only used the mobile as a satnav plugged into the car when driving between h and h for five days despite being a client for many years i had not used any data before and only use the mobile as a phone but their robotic staff cannot explain anything except emphatically state that the sim is infallible suggesting that i am lying they claim that i was warned that my data was used up when talk talk only sent an sms two days after the fact it is pointless arguing with robots and as soon as my contract is over i will never do any business with talk talk again,Bad
77,im stuck with o for another year and a half terrible signal whilst using data or making and receiving calls wherever i am they think they are treating me well as a customer by offering me a ipad gb at upfront and then monthly payments of thats all in all and they say its a saving of where do they get that figure from theyre only half that price with a quick online search cant wait for my phone contract to end as ill be signing up with someone who has a trustworthy signal and are more trustworthy when it comes to their customers,Bad

79,now into my second week of not working from home due to talktalk signed up no problem go live date of discovered router was faulty upon delivery on reported immediately no power light dead as a dodo and told i could not request a new router until after my go live date on th as this would cancel my order well of course reported the faulty router again on th as instructed even after having tried a new power cable still no joy power light flashing red now instead of not at all no new router sent but many tests done over the phone with the online cs person still no router sent but a booking made for a bt engineer to check the line excellent service from him he kindly rang the talktalk tech team after discovering that the line was fine the router faulty and ordered a new router day delivery assured with bank hol on fri expected new router saturday no router arrived online chatted to chase on monday afternoon assured it would arrive mon or tue no router received online chatted to chase tue afternoon to discover that no replacement router has been ordered though actually it had but there were errors on the order they say as far as im concerned if it wasnt ordered correctly it wasnt really ordered now im told that after my attempt a new router has been ordered and should be with me tomorrow i pointed out that i had been told a similar story last wednesday now one week on still no router by contrast i received my first bill on rd april before id even used anything pretty clear that the money takes priority over providing any kind of service on one occasion the agent left the chat without having answered my query and i wasnt even bad mannered chat agents online make promises which are not kept no doubt not their fault but such disjointed systems with teams in places working piecemeal do not make for a smooth customer experience when youre on the chat theyll tell you whatever you want to hear but in my experience this isnt backed up with any action at all extremely disappointing and expensive if you are and work from home id rather pay a little more and have my dealt with promptly and efficiently and actually get to use the service going with talktalk has been very frustrating and expensive im looking at finding a more reliable provider asap,Bad
80,they are now scrambling to get to all homes before proper reputable companies do the sooner bt dont have the advantage the better,Bad
81,not a very ethical company imho i placed my ee order via bt and received sim cards arriving days later than promised they invoiced a higher price than the one agreed so i phoned to cancel they gave me a two day run around with the cancellation and i felt sickened and locked into a contract i did not want i asked their team lead what would happen if i cancelled my dd he informed me they would send the bailiffs after me eventually someone has taken ownership of my complaint and i believe my issue may be resolved but overall this is not a very pleasant company to do business with imho,Bad
82,i received boxes and neither worked i was left with no tv for weeks or broadband however i did speak to several advisors who were helpful but i spent hours on the phone trying to get things up and was promised compensation which ive still not received,Bad

97,to be honest each time i call it takes one person minutes just to catch up on notes for this case to explain it in detail would be an setup was wrong to begin with months later literally every week or more having to make hour phone calls vodafone resolutions team promising things but apparently lying then admitting in the next conversation that the previous person was incorrect have transcripts and call ref numbers being passed to debt collection agencies when all of the fault was error being told as again listen to the calls complete loss of faith worst management of customers accounts i have ever seen still not resolved customer relations dept even told me everything was sorted only for service to be blocked less than an hour later customer care agents dont know what to say literally saying they have no words for how much of a bad service i have had this experience will put me off any vodafone product for life this is also after they were just fined millions for bad customer care cannot describe the experience i have had beyond belief and im very very tolerant resolutions team dont do anything billing dont have authority to make any changes speak to customer relations or ask to speak with customer relations as they are the best people to get things the ombudsman and ofcom and make complaints there take notes and record chat logs and get ref numbers from phone got customer relations to clear all arrears off account and set account back to only way there automated billing systems dont mess everything up only took a whole year,Bad

112,this is the worst company i have ever encountered in my sixty plus years on earth last year their staff told me an email i had received saying id be sent a router was a scam it was unbelievable how i was spoken to it wasnt a scam but at least five of their staff insisted it was even after the router arrived and one was incredibly rude and patronizing saying i was too stupid to understand a scam this year i went ten days with no phone and they failed to compensate me despite the fault being in a cabinet in the road every time i contacted one of their colleagues i was promised credit that never arrived each conversation lasted an hour they really are hopeless,Bad

131,dear vodafone main office im writing you to bring your attention to vodafone turkey and i hope you can do something about it because it is harming the name of vodafone installation for wifi was done today almost months passed however from the first day we never had the internet times the repair team came they could not solve the problem we made more than calls and send e mail they kept saying it is a problem that we can fix so we cant cancel the for free so i ask them ok you will fix but when cause according to the laws they have to resolve in hours they only respond they will resolve as soon as possible so it can take even year and they want tl if we want to cancel contract it is because of them we are without wi fi for months note before vodafone we were using the internet without any problem with another company we even call and pay for the electrician he confirmed there isnt any problem with the cables are really tarnishing the vodafone corporate name a lot of people are suffering from the same problem here in turkey,Bad

145,internet is constantly down today it is down and when i check the service status it says technicians are in the area working on a fix and it hopes to be up and running again at pm its been down since am and i work from home this is not acceptable i am paying for a service i cant use,Bad
146,i have been with this failed company since days and they get worse every year there service is without a doubt they worst in the uk to get someone who understands what you are talking about is a feat in its self i canceled my acount from the th of this month and they have taken the whole amout by dd and now tell me thy will take days to repay me since when did i become there bank this is theft and this in there eyes is standard do your self a favour and steer clear of these thieves,Bad
147,make sure your internet works both me and my son are constantly annoyed at paying our bill fir a service thats always down or slow internet is rubbish,Bad
148,the worst company whenever you need to actually get hold of them they reward your loyalty by increasing your bills every year and when you want to cancel they insist that you have to speak to the cancellations team you get put on hold and this team never picks up have wasted hours so far never again will i give my money to this awful company,Bad
149,scammers awful overseas call centre where you can hear all the other operators existing customers ripped off presumably in order to lure new victims into their clutches forcibly removed my landline too and have to rely on calls coming through the internet whilst making me pay an exorbitant cost for a call i cant wait to get shot of them when my contract expires i seem to be paying per month for the benefit of a mere router with a very poor range and the freeview channels i was once very happy with virgin but since being taken over by an american company they have become the epitome of cheap even a complaint that i raised with them was completely ignored they actually lied that they had tried to contact me by phone and ignored the email that i sent to the email provided and after all that they sent me a letter saying that they were delighted that they had solved the complaint to my satisfaction any company that shuts off over twitter is a scammer in my view shifty and useless,Bad
150,awful company my father took out a mobile phone contract in his name some years back but when he passed away we did not spot the direct debits coming out until some years later my mother who is elderly was unaware of the contract as dad dealt with everything and she never uses mobile phones when we spotted the direct direct we cancelled it and asked for a refund backdated to dads death offering to send them the phone and sim to prove it was not bereavement team dont seem to care nor do their complaints dept so we now have to let the ombudsman bother with them is my advice they only care about the money not the customer,Bad
151,it took me three and a half hours and spoke to different so called customer service staff going through security checks each time to cancel my account with virgin media i was cut off put on hold and argued with by more than one operator i would never go anywhere near virgin media again,Bad
152,charged me for a phone i had returned for months and when they finally sorted it they managed to cancel the dd but then attempted to take it sending my credit score tumbling spent minutes on the phone with them claiming i didnt owe anything and they dont know what happened why am i not surprised useless customer service and a terrible company leaving as soon as my contract is up and will never use them again,Bad
153,i left vodafone in december after being a contact customer for years my contact ended and they increased my monthly charge from per month to final nail in the coffin was being told that it would take days to move from my expired contact i was out of contract by months to a vodafone payg but i could leave vodafone that day without any charges or notice period how stupid is thati have moved to smarty exactly the same package for per month took hours to get my phone unlocked and transfer my number over,Bad
154,this is the most terrible company that i have ever experienced with fault has been detected in the area on oct was told that the fault would be fixed by the th was left with no internet for a week faults are faults fair enough on the th called customer service once again was told that it has now been pushed back to rd again no one has ever informed us or kept us updated with the situation terrible customer service too had to wait a total of minutes for a called to be answered was left with no internet once again on the rd i have once rang them up and was told that the date has been pushed back once again to the th i am currently left without any internet terrible customer service terrible technical support team this is the worst company i have ever encountered in my life absolutely ridiculous please save yourself from them and do not have your broadband with virgin media they are absolutely terrible with one of the highest prices in the uk too again please save yourself time and go with another company,Bad
155,terrible quality of service we moved house about months ago and moved our virgin broadband with us service has been underwhelming to say the least ever since patchy and weak wifi signal upon contacting virgin on at least different occasions within the last weeks weve continually been told there were ongoing maintenance works yet no compensation for the loss of service because it wasnt fully interrupted but intermittent last time we called they advised to upgrade our speed for a higher monthly fee which most definitely wouldnt have fixed the issue but was a sneaky and unsuccessful sales technique upon asking to terminate our contract we were told the disconnect fee was absolutely ridiculous considering they were asking us to pay to terminate a contract for a service that doesnt even work absolutely appalling and would not recommend to anyone,Bad
156,didnt work in my house no signal upstairs poor signal in lounge bt advertise they will refund if not satisfied within days tried to return and they want to charge me to return it to to call their number to talk to them it hangs up without you talking to anyone rang another number who tried to put me through to someone but it went back to the message saying contact us via use bt shop for extra info as number soi did ring that number on saturday it said you arent working and call back on i rang on monday at it said dial one for so orders so i did it then said we arent taking calls and hung up on me so i rang again and pressed waited mins on hold spoke to someone and explained they then put me through to the same place i had been whereby i pressed one and it hung up on me again,Bad
157,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad
158,internet service is terrible very unreliable and unfit for purpose engineers visit our area almost weekly with no regular improvement i have had countless phone calls to try and fix and no avail virgin promised me last time i reviewed the service would be improved it has not minutes on the phone with different operatives achieved nothing they are unable to release me from my contract without penalty despite awful broadband very unhappy if you value your sanity dont touch virgin they are crooks tried to charge me early disconnection for a service they do not provide as i am in contract to august i will look for other avenues to make virgin act as they should,Bad
159,internet is very bad very slow tv very glitchy and land line gets a lot of international phone calls so dont recommend at all,Bad

161,called bt customer services on thursday october th as unhappy with being charged per month for an email address which i can get for free had this email address for years i had an account with bt for broadband and land line telephone when i set the email address up this is the email address by which all of my friends family and business acquaintances know me due to the arrogance of bt with their take it or leave it non negotiable price increases i moved my broadband and landline business elsewhere but still retained my email a time when everybody is looking at cost saving exercises i contacted bt to discuss the per month charge for my email person to whom i spoke on thursday was the usual arrogant type that you come to expect from bt told me again that it is take it or leave it i asked to speak to a manager and was told a manager will only tell you the same as i have i detest people who say that i said lets see what a manager says was told that i couldnt be transferred right then but a team leader liam would call me back between pm and pm that call was rang again on friday i had to go through the whole sorry scenario again with the person i was speaking to and he gave me the same plausible statement which he was no doubt reading from his crib told me that their records show that somebody tried to call me between the stipulated times on thursday lies i had no call or missed call i was then told that this liam person had been messaged again and that he would call me between pm and pm no call was rang again on saturday morning another arrogant person on the other end of the phone who told me the situation is non negotiable and asked why i would want to speak to a told him that i wasnt interested in discussing the matter with him he told me that their system shows that this liam person is due to call me between pm and pm on monday october do these big companies treat people in this manner why do they lie i hate liars i wonder what the odds are of this call happening on i dont really because i know it wont happen,Bad
162,you for such a lovely to hear we were able to help when hope we can help you again,Bad
163,technical staff horrendous read off a script cant help you if not on script had maybe months of misery with them before finally getting it sorted after home visits new routers and maybe hours on the phone or on hold avoid unless virgin are the only provider with more than mb in your area like us,Bad
164,the worst service ever cancelled our phone order within days due to a technical error on os part yet still received phone and when sending back as instructed still not reviewed call to confirm been received even though to them still waiting for someone to contact us regarding complaint shocking customer service lack of it would never recommend o,Bad
165,worst customer service they will give but when we agree the deal they will treat like and they wont give offers and a agree with pounds broad brand and sim they change to different amounts after they will pounds aslo dont use virgin media better to go head another one,Bad
166,the major thing wrong with this company is communication and staff not knowing their job i wanted to cancel my contract and i was told you cannot cancel unless you give a reason if you dont give them a reason then you simply cant what a absurd thing to say if a customer wants to cancel its their choice and talk have to cancel even if it leads to customer early termination fees or out of contract us customers do not need a reason its called choice and my reason was no longer needed yet not an acceptable choice by talk talk hours on a phone line to get this sorted and having to talk to different customer service advisors with poor english is difficult and frustrating in itself with whatever youre response talk talk after you read this review is youre company is terrible and many people saying the same thing yet you still carry on giving poor customer service i will never return as a customer due to a company who employ the wrong people to sell or understand a customers needs we keep your business a float and its about time you listened instead of just apologising with no change to your business model shocking i said youre response is not what is happening in telephone calls to youre customer service so its better not to give a generic response and actually listen hours on a call to get anything done is unacceptable but thank you for your thoughtless response also the stats ate out there on the internet with who is worse provider take a look talk talk,Bad
167,the advisor i spoke to screen name was was very slow at typing taking minutes for every reply and often contradicted what they were saying so i had to repeatedly ask for clarification the entire session which should have only take minutes had taken almost an hour because of this i suggest that they should receive more training about policies and what they sell to customers because this person clearly did not have a good understanding of talktalk as a company and was not able to give me the necessary advice for me to make an informed decision,Bad
168,absolute my services lady called me yesterday to offer a big discount if i stay which i excepted to then have my tv cut off the same day called them oh she hasnt added the tv package on but i can do it for a stupid price each month done a complaint online to virgin which hasnt even gone through when you go back to track your complaint it doesnt exist,Bad

202,do not bother avoid incompetent unprofessional engineers with no common sense i think they must hire anyone its been over months my internet issue has not been resolved and have no internet you call them they assure you the problem is being dealt with and when engineers arrive they dont seem to know what they are meant to do or most importantly fix the issue ive had engineers arrive since st october and its th january today ive been offered a wifi dongle which im also guessing wont work wont arrive like the other deals they offer to make you stay and take your money save yourself the time and money and try a more competent company,Bad

213,had talk talk in different properties the first was out in the sticks of wales where i assumed everybody had a bad connection the second was in the heart of bristol both times my average speed would be around mbps it is genuinely as bad as dial up i cannot stress enough to anyone on here looking at this review to pay a little extra with another company it may cost an extra few pounds but it would represent better value as any money spent with talk talk is a legitimate waste also to point out that bt in the welsh outback is astronomically better despite the fact that any talk talk salesman would tell you that as they use the same lines it would make no difference to the speed if you choose them over another provider another point being they would happily tell this to your grandma as they unethically upsell products to her that she doesnt need,Bad
214,rubbish customer service my contract going to end in next month and ee sent me text i can go early upgrade and one lady call me as well and i was busy and i told ill ring back to discuss new contract and which i did call evening time a girl from ee transfer me to upgrade team and a boy who was on call is most unprofessional he keep talking to fellow people while i was on call and they keep laughing and i heard easily and i was so he told me samsung s cost month is over and same set they sell on at per month from where is got current ee contract when i told price was less on website then he told me to call back after my contract finish and still are you sit there to run customer awayi was with three years agoyou can argue about reception but there customer service is not bad as ee even they give me proof of purchase of my years old contract via email in a watch your team who is as they are totally unprofessional how can you ask a customer to call back later if a customer call at first a good salesperson must sell on one call and bad one is just time pass like the one assist me i will rethink to get new contact from ee or not,Bad

220,i have been using vodafone for a while now and all i can say isthe network sucks i have never seen a full bar in my network signal status ever since i bought it internet quality at less then kbps most of the other g network operators run faster then these the fastest i have ever seen is not more than kbps its a shame and i deeply regret that i chose vodafone i have to torture my patience for more,Bad
221,filled a survey stated problems i was having and the fact they are charging customers different prices for packages a customer service advisor rang and told me to ring up and we would get the deal only to ring and be refused offer lied to and time wasted unbelievably poor service since posting this and making a complaint ive had text messages saying virgin media tried to ring me funny no missed calls and no one else having issues told to ring up and the resolutions team would sort everything out they were useless dont think the lady new what she was doing and she was apparently the manager and by the way the number you said text on you cant send a text to it about the offers depending on your contract and how long youve been with virgin i had the same contract and have been a customer for longer and the offer is still getting advertised,Bad
222,had problems with the internet for days and over this period have used the online tools to test the internet connection the service centre finds the fault but cannot progress it to report the issue problems calling the phone number you cant talk to anyone problems locating online chat and when i finally do its either closed or unavailable yet i can write in to them to log a complaint which i assume may get lost take days to get there and days to get a response anyway i miss uk call help centres so if you do go with a provider who can answer a phone in this country this is what i will be doing asap,Bad
223,minutes to talk to someone i wished to upgrade and have the buyout waived after see a lot better contracts than my current one available with pretty much every provider easy when contract is up don t use vodafone even though they provide the best customer service in europe and uk according to their telephone people really poor sorry we are very busy is an excuse that should never be given to a customer it is not the customers fault a telecommunications company doesnt have a good enough customer service infer structures to handle customer calls,Bad
224,appalling customer service been having issues with them since january and still ongoing despite making formal complaints and even trying to cancel my services they continue to fail to fulfil their promise to me they have sent emails promising id be refunded for being overcharged but every month is the same no refund and i have to call yet again absolutely the worst customer service ive ever had and ill never go with them again once this contract ends,Bad
225,i am moving to sky as bt service is based around telling lies to get you to agree to any deal even though my contract finishes on nd october yet i am paid up until october they still want to charge me for an early termination the extra days that i have paid over my contract length they say will be refunded have you ever tried to get refunds from have had enough because when i last spoke to them on live chat the women at the other end cut me off when i pointed out that bt was not sticking to the contract deal so now i am left with having to face a long haul in trying to get back what i am owed if this was any other company it would be classed as fraud and as for the contract deal that i had it would be shown to be avoid this company as the letters bt fo bloody terrible,Bad
226,absolutely horrendous company trying to register lpa over weeks unhelpful staff wont let you complain or speak to a manager all they are interested in is taking money off vulnerable old people,Bad
227,a bit like the review from caan below they did not deliver my equipment after weeks so i asked them to terminate my contract they refused and demanded i pay them to cancel the contract ie the full payment term of the contract i refused as they had delivered nothing cancelled my direct debits and took back my initial payment of their call centre staff harassed me by phone for months on end and even their managers refused to see my grievance even though i put it in writing they passed on the case to a debt collection agency who demanded from me it was at this point i wrote to the after a month or so of reviewing the facts they found in my favor and said that the contract never commenced as it was perceived as a i would advise anyone in this situation to not cave in to their demands if they have not provided what you paid for then raise it with an independant body who will see things from a common sense and unbiased point of view bt are a disgusting company and shouldnt be allowed to be in business i give them another years before everyone realises how bad they are and jump ship to sky or virgin who actually deal with their customers like they were human beings,Bad
228,watch out from this provider they tricked me telling i could get good coverage in my area stoke on trent poorer service ever they also took of the line from my phone for hr if you ask to close the contract they wont do it dont trust them,Bad
229,i was going to leave virgin they made me stay put my bill down but lied about getting channels spoke to someone and said i could have channels but my bill would go up i explained that i was told i could have them when i decided to stay with virgin which was a lie he could not help useless still dont have channels i was promised thinking of leaving again now,Bad
230,i have never had so much trouble with a provider service kept dropping out many missed calls and messages that appeared weeks after they had been sent when i had had enough i called to say i was switching providers it took me three weeks to get the proper code to unlock my mobile i dont know why they didnt give me the nuc code along with my pac when i told them i was switching providers instead i was left to navigate endless unhelpful online and telephone menus and deal with staff who had no idea what was going on and kept repeating basic information that was no help whatsoever i had to go to their website four times to request my nuc at one point i was told my account was still active even though someone had called me two weeks previous to try and discourage me from leaving ridiculous you have to try to deliver this low level of service and i began to think was doing it on purpose to squeeze a few last pounds out of me before i left i hope they succeeded and felt very proud of themselves and i hope they are accustomed to the sound of yet another customer hanging up on them for good,Bad
231,their business is to screw you they are very good at it,Bad
232,horrible in every aspect dont bother getting you are going to get stuck,Bad
233,in my years of working in a service support environment i have never come across such poor customer service i have been a loyal customer of talktalk for many years now and have rarely needed assistance considering i haven so loyal and not been a drain on support resources i would expect a better service than what being provided,Bad
234,vodafone have been overcharging me since october after i renewed my contract with them every month i have rung and let them know theyve over charged me and every month ive spoken to a different person who hasnt rung me back as promised has promised the refund im due and fully entitled to that ive never received and has then just completely forgotten about the call nothing has been done whatsoever its terrible terrible customer service i had another bill today which is still incorrect and have had to phone again ive been made the same promises again have no faith in them sorting it out if i can im leaving have been with vodafone since and obviously they dont value their customers at all,Bad
235,absolutely disgusting purchased a talk talk broadband service on live chat days ago with a woman called which took over a hour to complete was told that someone will be out today to fit line rental gave all card details over live chat so took a day of work today to wait for line rental guy in meantime had no confirmation emails at all so decided to go back onto live chat this morning to see whats going on and why no confirmation email who was on other end chat asked me for my email address times before leaving the chat without helping me so i ring up talk talk customer service takes me mins to get through to someone who cant understand what im saying as they do not speak english only for her to put the phone down ring back and wait another mins for someone else to answer who also cannot understand the clearest of english language eventually get connected to a manager who tells my purchase was not processed and she doesnt know weather my card details are safe so hours of time and a days work lost they cannot helps with anything absolutely shocking do not use,Bad
236,i ordered for sim on th may with credit balance but still i didnt receive it every time i called the customer service they told will track in your sim and contact you within hours but no one contact me in hrs each and every time i need to call them and told the same reply this week they send another another one free instead of my ordered called for them about my credit there is no reply they are not ready to transfer my amount on to new sim card there was an unreasonable answer from customer care staffs always in my own experiences i never expect this kind of poor customer service from one uk brand company,Bad
237,absolutely useless servicei spent nearly two hours on a chat when connection lost i was asked to start despite fact that privacy statement says that all chats are recorded and one would assume therefore the chats were recoverable my contract is due for renewal next month and guess what it will not be renewed,Bad
238,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad
239,i bought a sim card from costing for gb sadly it does now work and i am asked to pay for the sim card again when i try to activate it its all very confusing and a bit of a let down i think that would do well to improve their customer supports as there is non at the moment please show us you care and help your customers,Bad
240,disaster trying to contact customer service few days before my contract ended they just kept passing me on to another call handler after nearly two hours they said they would end contract and customer service will return a call to enquire why cancelling person who called could hardly speak english informed i just wish to end contract and nothing more they started asking security questions which i refused to give as i felt was being spam now theyve sent a new bill shocking customer service never clear,Bad
241,poor customer service they have a disgraceful bot service instead of talking to a human being this is unacceptable im paying for a service im not getting to top it off i discover over with star rating reviews that is beyond appalling i thought virgin media was bad but this tops the lot come april bt will be a thing of the past i have been with bt for near a decade and the service is just getting worse and worse,Bad
242,internet sometimes being trying to cancel the contract since this is my last month but no one is answering the whatsapp messages no one available in the online chats and no one picks up the phone once an operator of your picked up and he hanged up keep trying but if my new bill comes higher and from your company i have screenshots and calls to move legally,Bad
243,i have been with virgin media for years they used to be great but i dont recommend them now the services have drastically got worse over the years poor connection inflated prices unhelpful technical support and hidden charges you have to keep upgrading buying routers and pods to get a semi good connection the customer service is always polite on the plus side however their hands are tied with costs and below average services i really would strongly recommend that you look into other broadband providers in your area before you join or at least look at reviews for virgin media services in your area i cant wait to leave them after my contract ends,Bad
244,the worst customer service ever tried to get through to customer service to be told my account number was wrong when it wasnt eventually got through on a different phone number to be told i shouldve been contacted to confirm something i hadnt been contacted and so my order hadnt progressed eventually cancelled my order as the whole thing was so inconvenient and took me about an hour being passed through from department to department,Bad
245,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
246,virgins apps and website intentionally do not work if you want to cancel or change anything you have to call and if youve forgotten a password you cannot change it therefore you will never be able to speak to anyone to get help im stuck with a monthly bill i cannot change and virgin will not help,Bad
247,like many others id give if i could after my first contract ended which was a home phone never even used it once and our m fibre broadband one of their lower tiers of internet i phoned up for a new deal as i was paying for basically just low end internet for nearly i phoned and live chatted them more than a handful of times to see what i could do but not a single one was interested in lowering the price and instead repeatedly offered me virgins more expensive deals worth what a i got someone who wanted to help he knocked off got me a sim included aswell as volt m fibre broadband and i settled my bill which was around i withheld paying them due to being not wanting to yes incredibly stupid and then fast forward half a month to payment date and they then take out a second again i get on the phone to resolve this they took my money and then had the cheek to tell me i cant have it back and the only option going forward was to put it in credit i dont know about you guys but my money is my money and this is really borderline theft to christmas i will definitely be cancelling my contract and running as far away from this scummy company as note not all employees are terrible but if anything ever goes wrong good luck trying to find someone who genuinely wants to help,Bad
248,if i had the choice i would have scored the call centre works on the principle of doing the opposite of what u request,Bad
249,constant issues with our tv package and box customer service is slow and ultimately see that well be remaining past the duration of the contract unless things drastically change,Bad
250,bt are the worst company iv ever had the dismay to have to deal are rude obnoxious aggressive and disconnecting our network to taking and demanding extra company of that size and the amount they charge you would expect a good service and and good service you would not expect to be sworn at and company abysmal customer care,Bad
251,we have lived in this house now for three years and every time we receive the previous owners bill my wife has returned it to sender with a message that he no longer lives at this address in addition my wife has twice phoned vodafone and explained that we continue to get these bills last time they asked for the account number and said they would stop it being sent out in addition she has sent emails to vodafone seriously with such a poor customer service i would never switch to them,Bad
252,if youre a business customer with over sims and want to speak to someone for anything other than basic enquiries you have to wait up to hours for someone to call you thats if they call you back if you dont have enough sims but still over then you get stuck in limbo without a specified account manager to handle any queries,Bad
253,please stop calling me regarding updating my mobile phone or package more than calls over the last month i keep asking not to be called but they still keep calling its a sad state of affairs when a loyal customer is thinking of switching providers because of being harassed constantly,Bad
254,i have never written a review before in my life and this is my first the worst wifi ever bad service literally everything about virgin is bad dont ever join virgin you will regret service is rude and they over charge on everything if there was a choice of giving virgin a star i would give no stars leaving and never coming back,Bad
255,id like to take this opportunity to tell you how disappointed we have been in your service since coming to the end of our fixed term you more than doubled our monthly rate to a ludicrous clearly we werent going to continue with that so we had to look elsewhere unfortunately as we both worked from home we needed to ensure we had to have a consistent broadband connection so needed to continue with your crazy price while we had an fibre connection installed before we could cancelling our broadband service with you we have been bombarded with emails phone calls and text messages offering us lower and lower prices the latest being for a mb connection this itself begged the question that if you were able to offer us a faster speed at a lower rate than our original contract why did you think we were likely to pay more than double our original bill i can only guess you either thought that we were so rich that we wouldnt notice we were suddenly paying a month or that we were so technically illiterate that we didnt realise that other providers were i appreciate our original contract may well have stated that after our initial years then we will start paying but if you want to maintain customers it may be best to contact them offering cheaper deals before they commit to a different provider rather than harass them once they have told you they are leaving to that end once we have told you that we are leaving id appreciate it if you could accept that we have left and stop spamming us with offers to stay with the relentless emails phone calls text messages and letters regarding collecting the router is getting tiring so if you can let us know how to reimburse you the we can look to do the fact that we now have an fibre connection in our house means we no longer need the virgin cables trailing around our house so i have cut them back ive put the cables in a box if you would like to collect it so that you dont go on to charge us for that,Bad
256,its actually quite shocking how bt has become it used to be a powerful brand one you could trust now its nothing but a collection of incompetent with the worst it systems in the business theres literally nothing more frustrating than dealing with this company theres an amount outstanding on my account that theyve acknowledged is an error on their system theyve told me numerous times that i dont owe them anything and that they have manually wiped the debt from my account so i should just ignore all the automated emails i receive chasing me for payment and yet ive just found out that they referred me to a debt collection agency for money theyve confirmed in writing i dont owe them my credit rating has now been adversely affected and the only thing bt can do about it is apologise for the yourself a favour dont use any of their services customer service is ridiculously crp the line drops most times you call them and then you have to start from scratch their services are overpriced and open reach engineers either never turn up or cancel last minute incredibly annoying if youve had to take time off work to be at home that worst of all they like to shakedown their customers for debts that dont exist and then hide behind their it system claiming its not their this rate bt is going to go under fairly soon you dont want to be on that ship when it sinks theyll be chasing you for money you dont owe them for years,Bad
257,i would give none if i could so unorganised customer service is a joke say they will pay compensation and they dont cannot speak to anyone who knows what they are doing as soon as contract is up im off,Bad
258,the item came crushed and it looks like it was opened i dont want to risk returning it as their return policy means i will likely have to pay the postage to return it,Bad
259,where to start i dont even want to review this with star doesnt even deserve star rating different people have different rules and each advisor says a complete different thing to the next been with them over years no issues before vodafone have placed me in a horrible position due to their fault and technical issues i regrettably decided to have a phone sent to my home from a sales advisor on the phone amazing deal sold it well i was impressed off to good to be true which it was too good to be true very upset and disheartened the phone got sent out to me which the next day when it came i got told they mistakenly sent the wrong phone out to me that i need to send it back and once the return is complete the new phone will be sent out the contract i signed was the wrong one for the phone they had sent out i got told i didnt have to worry about fees or extra costs or the upfront cost which was a lie sent a phone out that was wrong i sent it back the same day and they said it was going to be terminated so no bill should have been created for a phone i dont have how ever im now faced with the upfront cost of the phone i dont have didnt order and its not the right contract but vodafone created the bill before it was sent back even though it was sent back the same day still proceeded and trying to bill me for their mistake paying an upfront cost for a phone i dont have just so it can be credited into my account after telling them i am leaving as i am upset with how ive been treated i still cant be refunded the amount of the upfront cost i with how its been handled no responsibility at all taken on behalf and they have lost a loyal customer and a contract no one wants to take responsibility for their mistake and ive got pay for it and be out of pocket only to be credited wont be having a contract again and i advice if you do have a contract go in store and talk to someone who knows what they are doing better yet got to a better provider that will treat their customers better,Bad
260,cowboy engineers who first tell you they cant install broadband in your flat even though the other five have broadband installed then tell you its the trees fault then fix the issue with the tree at some unknown time only to fail to turn up on the day theyre supposed to finish the installation and dont bother letting you know appalling company that knows they have everyone over a barrel ive now accumulated months compensation by my provider because of people rely on you to work do your job properly,Bad
261,poor broadband speed not as fast as stated i would get poor customer service i asked to cancel my contract after months and cannot even do that avoid,Bad
262,this year our connection has dropped sixteen times we would be without internet for six days before its fixed virgin media status says everything is okay we had two hub exchanges and the same issue they refuse to refund us refuse to compensate us and now have cancelled our two year deal without telling us we then get a notice that we owe three months after they cancelled our contract without warning we have never missed a billing date and have just paid december they have the nerve to lie to us and now are ignoring us i think its time to go to bt until ofcom fines them too many customers with the same issue,Bad
263,if i could give bt zero i would have done i vowed i would never use them again years ago and like a fool i went back to them because their new router was touted as being one of the best and i was fed up with my slow sky one bt guaranteed meg download speeds and when an engineer tested the speed into the router is was coming in as a steady and consistent meg for the last month however the wifi speeds out of the router are as low as meg and varies up to meg i regularly get buffering on my tv especially with bbc iplayer but also with other stations it is intermittent trying to sort this problem with bt is virtually impossible during normal times but during the hopeless all you do is go around in circles and get very frustrated when my contract is up i will definitely never use them again bt get,Bad
264,being a charity we decided to go with bt business to ensure we always had a phone line that worked and if there was a problem it would be sorted took an extra direct debit from us in march of over still to return of it numerous calls emails texts all promising its return only to get bog all back it doesnt help that the call centre is jn indian and the complaint guy is indian who speaks poor english between his poor english hearing car horns and busy traffic outside its a nightmare he texts to say he will phone you in minutes to discuss it then phones right away totally useless ive been lied to numerous times promised it back via bank and now by cheques and nothing has arrived they have our bank details and have managed to take the next two months direct debits since then but cant refund it back absolutely disgusting how the heck is british telecom using indian people and we are unable to speak to anyone in the uk is beyond disgusting its now in the hands of the financial ombudsman and also have put in a formal complaint about the following personal if you get this guy run and ask for someone else as he is a business as predicted got the usual reply from bt totally useless,Bad
265,i have been a loyal top package on tv broadband and phone for years i would have said star up until months ago i have had either low to no signal on my wifi since changing to the hub i have given them the benefit of the doubt with engineers boosters new hubs and setting changes to be told theres nothing else we can do its your house thats the problem im so angry i was passed from department to department to be told oh well you should have cancelled way back so its my fault its my house thats the problem and not the fact they have taken my money off me over months and failed to give me my services week in week out when they should have known my house was the problem the day i moved into it and they came to install the customer service is disgusting and they now either expect me to wait on hold minutes to speak to another department or hrs for complaint team to call me back then to top it off they dont do full refunds dating back months for breaking there own contract yet charging me for services that i never received continuous over the month so i need to go to ofcom and ask them to step in i had to fill out forms to do even this i then had to mark down days dates and times i lost my signal which baffles me cause i wasnt told i had to keep these or was allowed to have a copy from virgin to claim as they cant do this so i other words you can claim but you also need alot of additional information and even then we will say no and only pay you if ofcom says we failed lost a loyal customer big clap to yourself,Bad
266,two things to consider first i have been with talktalk for over two years at my current property and had no problems i own an it business so broadband is critical what should be a painfully simple thing ie moving house and taking my broadband supplier with me has turned into a that only the most sadistic author would include in a horror novel i called talktalk to advise of an address change no problem came the reply i said that i also wanted to upgrade the package as my new property is a gigabit line no problem we can put you on the mbps service to go live on the same date as the old line ceases perfect i i was advised that i could only have the line but theyd upgrade when possible ok i thought i can live with that then two days later a text arrived saying there was a problem with setting up the new package one hour call later and i was finally advised that there would be an day with zero service on both old and new house not acceptable i thought so i called to cancel the package and simply close my old line on the prearranged day another two hour call later and still they couldnt cancel it with the line simply going dead in the meantime i called sky with whom i have a broadband service on a separate property within minutes all set up and ready to go eleven days earlier than talktalk could do and the full mbps plus a load of free extras including free netflix for months and a free so now im on the phone to talktalk again and they cant even find the order or my account details in order to cancel it another minutes so far talktalk you should be absolutely ashamed your helpline service is appalling your customer service agents seem to know nothing and your service in general absolutely stinks perhaps one of the directors should actually try and get in touch with you via the normal means and see just how utterly rubbish the service is of the company they sit at the helm of never never never again i will now be advising every single one of my it clients that they should never even consider talktalk use talktalk at your peril,Bad
267,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
268,my order never arrived i have messaged bt twice but nobody has replied,Bad
269,having spent nearly three hours on the telephone today with multiple customer service and technical people i can only conclude that the company is incompetent with the exception of one person who was helpful and diligent everyone else has lied and me off with whatever story would get me off the phone one call took hr mins which luckily gave me time to write to the advertising complaints authority to flag to them that their website includes claims of guaranteed broadband speeds that even their staff are surprised at i genuinely feel sorry for the person that has had to represent to me today she deserves a thanks for your generic reply however please not that my name is not samantha and if you are going to reply please dont post a message to someone else in the response,Bad
270,i have a had very bad internet for a week now everytime i get on the phone to get some support i am on hold for an hour at least tonight they just hung up on me after an hour of waiting the website is useless absolutely no sign of a support section or online chat yet on the phone they tell you there is online chat support available yet to find it and im considering leaving this provider total disgrace in terms of customer support,Bad
271,the worst customer service experienced so far in my life i took out a contract and the day the equipment arrive i was told to activate it the same day someone apparantly updated my contract and my discount as a new customer removed i realised this from the online update to my account two days later i picked up on this through email saying thanks for making changes to my contract no changes had been made and my bill of pound promised by agent went up to charge for march which would go up to pound after another issue was the number changed on my landline my brother was previously with virgin and when i carried on a new contract from the renewal they changed it and didnt tell me it would be changed im a first time having spent up to a week talking to agents who promised they would sort this i decided to finally cancel to be told it would be fixed too late theyre a bunch cons they couldnt even explain why this discount had been removed they have offshore call centres in india who dont have a monkeys clue of what customer service means but the agent who sold me the contract from the uk was poor too it took someone a day to screw up my contract ironically but over several days no one could fix it and i kept getting false promises dont speak to their useless doggy customer representatives again i was either miss sold or someone went into my account and screwed it up either way i hope fca fine them for the headache theyve caused me and many others dont touch virgin theyre rip offs,Bad
272,can never get threw customer service agents are rude and dont listen over charge some months,Bad
273,one star is too much the engineer turned up on the th january without prior warning this wasnt too much of an issue seeing as the services should then be activated earlier it would have been nicer to have earlier warning though the communication with bt needs to improve following on from the engineers appointment the online system stated i had received the equipment but missed the engineers appointment it still states this now this online system needs to improve to reflect the reality as it causes me concern that the services still wont go live the online chat never seems to work to be able to contact anyone i either get an error or that its unavailable both the online overseas contacts and overseas call centre on your phones dont seem to be able to help with anything that is off script i have spoke to at least different people i have been told countless times that i need to get in touch a day after or that they need to contact me again tomorrow only for nothing to happen i have had countless contacts from myself to try and get this resolved which has not only caused me frustration has also cost me time in trying to get this resolved i eventually got a second engineers appointment booked on the th feb only to receive a call at on sunday th feb when my phone was switched off stating this appointment cant go ahead not only did this leave me without any idea how to get this resolved i could not contact anyone back that day as your call centres were closed this left me even more frustrated the communication from your customer services centre needs to vastly improve it is unacceptable being left voicemails without answers and having no way of contacting i am told i do not need a second engineers appointment and the services will be live within hours weeks later th march still no services not only that i have been put on a contract paying more than double of what i signed up company that cant do anything apart from sticking to the script,Bad
274,absolutely disgusted with ee my month contract is up and i was asked if i would like to upgrade as i am happy with my phone i said no i then assumed that my bill would drop as i have paid for the phone the answer is no you keep paying until you call and say you want sim only so technically you could keep paying for years luckily i have only paid for an extra month i also enquired about a device i have returned i was told as they are short staffed it hadnt been processed yet so that is also on my bill absolutely disgusting behaviour taking money off customers like that stay on it customers or this company will just take take take from you,Bad

313,this technician just cut off my conversation i was simply asking for help from him in his capacity as technician when he closed the chat as there is an open complaint they are prevented from dealing with me and want me to talk to a manager on the phone instead i was reluctant to since the previous chat on lasted all afternoon from till tea time while i was passed from one agent to another none of whom could take responsibility for the issue i found this to be a traumatic and exhausting experience following that a call came from a manager on a day that i specifically asked them not to call i explained she was calling at the wrong time and asked if she had read the transcript of the previous lengthy chat she admitted she had talktalk agent tells me managers do not have access to those chat transcripts another says the opposite is true i have not been able to use the box which is an old used one in replacement of a broken one because after partially working at first it also am at my wits end with talktalk they appear to be lacking in useful training and have passed me round and round with no solution i am repelled by this treatment so much so that since the th of this month i have not had the courage to call them again i cant get them to even take an honest approach to what in reality is a very simple problem incompatible box met with baffling even so i will now go and call the manager hotline and see if there is anything they are really prepared to other than receive direct debits from me,Bad

344,before telling your customers they can have a free full fibre upgrade and sending a new router you should check that your contractors are able to do the job waisted a days holiday from work waiting to be told i would have to contact my housing association for permission to fit the cable underground you dont do these checks apparently you have completely waisted my time and cost me a days holiday roll on september when my contracts up do some checking in the future,Bad
345,awful can never get through to customer care yet if you ring sales they answer in they can get away with service so poor says a lot about corporate power in the uk,Bad
346,virgin signs you up to long contracts makes you pay for elements you dont need or want line rental the app is as good as useless overall nothing positive to say counting down to the end of the contract,Bad
347,i opened an account with over two years ago in all fairness they are very cheap the price was perfect for me at the time as well as the usage plan i decided i quickly came into difficulty with the company as my tariff quickly shot up with no explanation i purchased my contract and phone in store at but unfortunately should you have any problems this store cannot help you as they only sell the contracts rather than work with despite this fact i came to a very helpful man at the desk of who was more than happy to help me with my problems i had with my phone were the which i was paying for wasnt was being charged extensive amounts unknowingly if i went over my couldnt cap my limit so i could reach a bill of way over i tried updating my payment details over times each time saying i was successful undoing so yet i was still receiving threatening texts and letters to say that should i fail to update my payment method within x amount of days they will be forced to take legal action and send bailiffs to cover my rapidly growing debt to the company i must add i had updated my payment to the same account many times and had more than enough money in my bank account to cover costs but each month the company told me they were unsuccessful in withdrawing money from my account each time myself or a member of phoned up talk mobile to discuss these problems we either came to a half an hour que on the phone lines we were sent round in circles being told we need to phone various different numbers instead we reached extremely rude talk mobile customer services staff and on numerous occasions we were hung up on i must add the cut of each time from customer services was not due to a fault on my end of the line as i phoned from various different mobiles and landlines each time being cut off i tried cancelling my contract with the company because of all the hassle which just seemed to be added to each time i tried to sort one issue out i found cancelling would cost a lot more than i was willing to pay which is what i expected would be the case anyway instead i agreed with the company to stop the use of the phone but still pay for the contract until the end however half way down the line i found the cost of my contract to increase by each month despite the fact this phone was no longer in i phoned up the company to ask why this was only to be cut off three times and eventually reach rude member of staff again who couldnt answer my the one and a half years i have had to put up with this company i have not only made numerous pointless and costly phone calls but also emailed time and time again only to get an automated response telling my they will get back to me within days surprise surprise not once out of the times of emailing did i get a response all in all i think this company is a lot more hassle than its worth with problem after problem rude staff and an apparent excellent customer service team which cant answer your questions and hang up in doing soi think its needless to say i will never to returning to this company and i wouldnt even recommend the company to a passer by or a stranger in the street let alone friends or family its an absolute joke,Bad
348,i am writing this after making my second over minute call to these clowns they really take customers as being mugs and i must say honestly their customer service is the worst i have come some reason virgin medias broadband only works intermittently despite being the most expensive one i have rung them to complain and today was my final straw and i rang them to terminate my gigs is only worth it if it actually works for me it works a few hours and then goes off for several hours frustrating and worse virgin media do not have a clue they keep telling me to turn my router on and off for sake i told the that i have turned it off and on a hundred times the problem is the signal not the guess richard used to watch too many episodes of the it crowd and their have you tried turning it off and on routine anyway i advise anyone reading this please do not be fooled by virgin medias advertising virgin media is the worst and most unreliable broadband supplier and there is zero customer support other than telling you to switch off and onthe joke is they pretend to do a signal test and tell you that you have not switched off and on enough,Bad
349,although the people that work in the call centre are very helpful and friendly i will never use vodafone again i cannot wait for my contract to end so i can go back to ee i have had nothing but problems with vodafone and their lack of signal my phone cuts off mid call if i walk out of the room i have a sure signal box but this only works if im close to it also if i didnt have broadband i wouldnt be able to use the sure signal and the phone would be useless my mobile data doesnt work at home either basically this company needs to buck up their ideas and start spending some money to ensure their customers get what they are paying for,Bad
350,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad
351,falsely enticed into rolling forward a contract due to the extremely low price offered for monthly payments now that initial bill has jumped from pm to pm customer services were abysmal and offered no resolution to leaving the contract early not any alternatives just forced to pay more than of what was originally agreed most recently they have added a increase and deemed it as an inflation increase sadly my salary hasnt suffered the same inflation increase to afford this excess expenditure no room for discussions this is taken out of my account at the end of this month with weeks notice and every month thereafter im now paying more per month for a year old phone with terrible camera quality than i would be for a newer model with another company,Bad
352,i never had issues with but even when i have an unlimited international and national uk minutes available it is not letting me make international calls it says insufficient balance,Bad
353,i am absolutely disgusted was happy on my payg sim at got a call saying i should move to pay monthly got told it would be i had just paid day before for my months allowances was told this would be credited was told i passed credit check just seen i have a bill for a deposit for i was never told about and also payment of what about my credit for i was told i would have no bill first month absolute con man i was speaking to i would like the call listened to and an official complaint raised,Bad

355,it is cheap which may be an excuse for the low speed of the connection but it is for sure no excuse for the weekly issues with internet connection it is rare the day we have internet working the h and sometimes we may be offline for the whole day unacceptable,Bad
356,rubbish company rubbish connection poor customer service with people in indian call centres that can hardly speak a word of english totally unhelpful ive reported bt to ofcom and the ombudsman service dont waste your money with bt use a more reliable service provider like sky or talk talk avoid bt,Bad
357,unbelievable cant communicate properly systems that fail to that are clearly stupid sends me a bill that shows that my account is in credit and tries to tell me that a credit balance means nothing doh,Bad
358,were do i start since they took over upc the service has gone from bad to worse we complained about the service last november and only after we complained did we get a new modem no better have to say but because we werent using it that often but my god how bad its been rang and complained again this not happy with the answer so wanted to cancel i tried to give days notice and was told there wud be a penalty for breaking a contract which we were told by a salesman we cud cancel at any so i was told i would get a phone call within hrs great start to try and appease meso its been over weeks and no one has had the decency to call me i did emails apologizing for the treatment and again someone wud contact me within hrs and still say when you deal with virgin media you deal with is an insult to if i could give them a zero i would i cannot wait to get shot of them and never have to deal with these muppets again,Bad
359,only one star because you cant give it zero dont waste your time its absolutely fine although very over priced i cant explain to you the level of upset stress and general ruining of my days virgin has been responsible for there customer care is an absolute joke those poor people on the end of the phone having to deal with frustrated customers because of their systems do not put yourself through it virgin is an absolute nightmare they cannot help you in any way when there is a problem and its very strategically set up that way on purpose so they dont lose any money it is impossible to reduce package or switch to pay and go effectively because they are losing money if there is anything that will have them loss revenue they will take years to pretend its being sorted out passed from department to department until you give up bottom line virgin media is for rich people who dont mind money but even if i was rich i wouldnt put a penny in this company pocket,Bad
360,i have had a terrible time with ee two orders of a new iphone xs max and both times let down the first was meant to be delivered by there home care team on a friday afternoon and should of been here on the pm slot and of course no show contacted ee who talked me into a second chance again ordered sent by dpd of course was not delivered and when i contacted ee customer services the driver had supplied them of a picture of what was supposed to be my front door however it was a totally different door and of course showing no number i shall now be taking my business to a company that really wants my business and can step up to the plate with customer care,Bad
361,worst company ever if zero was an option wouldve definitely gave worth the appointment got times and been waiting for the for over month the customer service number is pointless and never helps,Bad
362,shocking service from talktalk this is the second issue in the space of months billing issues and customer service staff that just do not listen pretend there are no notes then find them when you produce evidence hide behind standard procedures to draw the complaint out hoping you will give up asked for escalation to directors office and told complaints team would contact me told them i knew there was a process they could escalate directly to a higher office and point blank refused this could be sorted in minutes but i will now lose hours of my life trying to sort,Bad
363,very poor customer service representatives lied to me on two occasions saying a product had been sent out to me when it hadnt asked for compensation for delayed service and was told they would only take my issue as feedback you can only contact them back via phone which takes so long i cant be bothered so they win by creating their own poor systems,Bad
364,internet is slow and range is just funny i have my router in living room but once i got to balcony i lost all signal within m,Bad
365,for over a month ive had no mobile sim as i was told my previous number which was linked to another virgin account would be transferred to my personal account after trying to transfer with a pac code i was told virgin dont inhouse transfer numbers between sims so they would transfer the right of ownership of my number to my personal account which would then take over the unlimited sim already on my account so throw that sim away and keep my old one seems simple enough i was told it would take up to hours to transfer fast forward a month of which i had no problems with the sim so thought nothing of it almost exactly to the day and my sim is disconnected overnight meaning no outbound calls or texts or data i call up and explain the situation for minutes and was hung up on recall another minute explanation and im told that it has been disconnected and theres no mention of it being transferred to my account and that they would need to try and retrieve it from being disconnected via their it department and then reactivate it and it could take up to again hours considering this was on a thursday i decided to leave it for the weekend and monday still a dead sim so another call again explaining for another minutes they look on my account and it has no logs of my situation or them contacting the it department to chase my sim in this call i actually had someone who seemed bothered and actually gave me a reference number and told me to wait business days so i did and still nothing call again another minutes explaining the situation to someone who doesnt seem to understand to be told that theyd send a new sim within working days however they didnt take the previous reference number even when offered it neither did they take my address which considering they only pulled up the previous account where the number was registered leads me to believe itll either be sent to the wrong address or not sent at all my money is on the later every time ive called up ive had to have the previous account holder next to me to confirm their identity etc which i understand is protocol but youd think after the first couple of times theyd have put on the accounts that the holder is agreeing to a rights transfer of the number especially when the previous account holder is my mother and doesnt have virgin anymore and was supposed to have had her account closed my number has been in my possession for over years before it was even linked to virgin and everything in my life is linked to it so giving up and just getting a new would be the most inconvenient thing but honestly i dont think im going to have any choice at this being a user for years ive only been an account holder for about months now since i moved and in that time ive found the internet will randomly disconnect wireless devices especially not good when you use wireless security cameras something to do with the just not being able to cope with more than or so wireless devices so i just plugged in a cheap wireless modem and that fixed that problem and also gives more range than the abysmal range of the though the just wouldnt work in router mode so had to daisy chain ive had almost every iteration of the over the years and they just get worse and worse also ive noticed that the internet download speeds will randomly just drop upload remains constant and thats on an ethernet connection directly plugged into the hub not to mention in those two months it has gone completely dead a handful of times which it happens but now virgins home phones are over the internet they go down too so no internet no mobile and no landline means i have to twiddle my thumbs and always has had a poor foreign customer service department a result of a monopoly on internet speed allows them to not care to improve,Bad
366,left without broadband working for ten weeks and no home phone for about weeks complained very many times yet keep getting bills for services which were not working engineers never bothered to turn up yet i had to wait in for them now a letter from their debt collectors trying to threaten me pay me my compensation or lets get to court you have had many warnings playtime is over,Bad
367,awful company i recently missed a payment due to a change of circumstances i tried to contact them to tell them i cannot pay until a specific date but i was just told sorry well have to disconnect your phone cant you pay sooner despite saying i cannot afford to theyve now cut off my phone completely disgusting company not considerate at all especially to the current cost of living crisis they harass you none stop phone calls when you miss a payment not helpful when youre at work funny how when you miss a payment they disconnect you and harass you but when your phone has had poor data connection and phone calls constantly cut out they dont want to know or help you at all,Bad
368,absolutely disgusting service reported a problem over month ago had engineers out still not fixed months on but they reckon the fault is fixed and gave me as apparently my services were down days they are a joke so another day ive got to spend on the phone to people that lie dont no what there actually doing,Bad
369,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
370,disgusting company charged me for a premium paying a month for broadband package they want over to cancel my contract greed greed greed,Bad
371,worst experience ever every time you call them they said over the phone your internet its fixed now but after a week wont work again and you have to call them every week so they can fix it most of the times they are we cant do anything about it as its shows that you dont need an technician to fix it,Bad
372,as agreed with all the other reviewers who would rather give a zero as star is pushing it many years with vm and many problems to go with internet from the start my little bed semi is clearly made of lead as needed boosters i had of them then make the massive mistake of wanting the best internet package where i was unwillingly moved from virgin mobile to o on an m contract but didnt find this out till much later out of cancellation period so called to complain originally about being billed twice over the agreed deal plan was told someone will call me back in received so i went on chat were i received another customer complaints number and still nothing very upset and angry that they were just stealing my money i wanted out and away from virgin altogether so instead of yet another awkward sales phone call from an overseas call centre i decided to write a letter made sure it was sent recorded delivery and guess what even though the letter had the correct address it came back as recipient not known at address return to sender i was gobsmacked i called royal mail and asked why or what happened they said they are clearly not accepting mail so with yet another days wasted i called virgin againi was not having any of their and basically spewed all my complaints where i had to repeat the same quibble to agents they all while talking to them had some computer issue or computer error unbelievable maybe they should switch providers after going around in circles i asked the vm agent if this call was being recorded he said yes to which i replied i want to cancel all my virgin media services as they also emailed me to tell me i couldnt cancel without verbally informing them their only interest was getting me to pay early contract cancellation fees i eventually after hours got my virgin media services cancelled but i have a funny feeling o are coming for me seriously needs to be done about these cowboys as if i didnt take snapshots of all the deals i wouldnt have a leg to stand on dont touch these without proof of every offer and be prepared to fight for your money back the reply is absolute may find this useful early disconnection fees yeah still trying to get money out of me joke,Bad

374,terrible terrible terrible terrible customer service avoid on two occasions left me without wifi for two weeks when i absolutely need it and it was a disaster after disaster then they failed to compensate it properly oh and i had to use my skills to find out an email of some vp to sort me out its the worst customer service ever i would never go back even if they offered anything for free,Bad
375,from installation my hub has delivered weak wifi signal virgin previously addressed this by shipping free extenders but these were not in stock when i enquired and now customers are being expected to pay a month for a mesh system this is unacceptable given that the fault lies on the weak wifi capabilities of the hub virgin supplies customer service is abysmal relying on call centres apparently in india where staff can resolve nothing and on the rare occasion you actually get to speak to someone struggle to understand and be understood i was overcharged for the first few months of my contract and this money was not refunded instead i was given credit i will not be renewing my contract with virgin given the experience i have had,Bad
376,thieves and scammers choose another company crappy level of customer service even now they are trying to extort money from me,Bad

381,after waiting for days for an engineer to visit and fix our broadband they came today and could not ring the doorbell our entry way is a bit tricky to their they have done to reach me though was to try to call me from the landline number that is registered on my virgin account without attempting to give a call on my mobilei have contacted cs and provided with the info above and now waiting on the line to be answered by their tech support for the last minutes most likely i will end up getting another booking for days ahead just because we could not let them in after a wait period of days without them attempting to ring me on my mobile apathy utter utter lack of solution orientation,Bad
382,asked why virgin media customers could leave but loyal o customers could not no response i now pay pm for mb new customers just extraordinary then to read their new promo nobody likes feeling as though theyre being shortchanged especially in a cost of living crisis,Bad

384,i have been on the receiving end of the shocking tmobile business services and i would strongly advise against taking out a business contract with current business phone stopped working so i renewed my contract with them on th december with purpose of upgrading my phone within a few hours i called them back to ask if i would be better going into a store rather than waiting on them delivering as we were needing the phone for business the tmobile advisor agreed this would be the quickest way and would cancel the new contract on their system and within hours i could go into a store start a new contract and get a new phone it turns out this was the worst advice i could possibly have at today rd january i am still without a phone and no further forward in getting a new one i called tmobile every day from th december to th december and have been told a different story every time about why the contract has still not be cancelled this means i have been stuck with a broken phone cant renew my contract and get a new phone the really frustrating thing is that the black hole of tmobile also prevents me from moving to another mobile company as my mobile number has been hijacked by them pending them sorting out the phone calls to them i tried to raise a formal complaint with a supervisor on rd december and was discouraged he would rather sort things out for me than raise a complaint didnt hear from him again called again on th december and said i wanted to raise a complaint i was advised a supervisor woud call me back no call eventually wrote a formal complaint to the address on their website on th december i know this was received by them on th december as it was sent recorded however i had not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement as they promise in their complaints procedure having been without a business phone for over weeks over our busiest trading time is completely unacceptable and being off with inconsistent excuses by staff who clearly are not trained on their company procedures even less so,Bad
385,talktalk be warned this company is to be avoided at all cost i have spent months trying to sort out different problems eventually being hassled by numerous tt operatives sometimes twice a day all who know nothing and will keep you on the phone occasion over l i refused to speak on phone and have sent by mail an official complaint to the ceo but all i get is a letter saying its deadlock and i gather elsewhere to leave will cost me near now having reluctantly gone on line to my account it states unfortunately you cannot make changes to your account online right now i do not know what contract they have me on and certainly had no intention of signing on for further time i still await a proper reply to my letter of and consider especially as a customer this is appalling service,Bad
386,i have recently signed up to tesco mobile and have sim only contracts for my family all i wanted to do was add another sim to the contract but no matter what i do the payment always fails at the last screen after going through verification with my bank initially i was using the same credit card that i used for the first sims but since then i have tried multiple payment cards which all work fine with other vendors but get the same result every time two extremely unhelpful calls to customer service who both insisted the bank is refusing payment and could do nothing else to help i explained that it is highly unlikely that different banks would all refuse payment and i have contacted the banks who insist they are not blocking payment and that it looks like tesco do not complete the transaction i cannot tell you how frustrating it is i must have tried times to do something that should be so simple and the deal i was trying to get pm which the other family members are all on has now expired im totally stuck irritated and frustrated by the whole since posting this i see others who seem to be having the same problem tesco youve got to do something about this youve clearly got some system issues that are preventing people completing their purchase not to mention the customer service issues with staff who are either unwilling or unable to following tesco response i did call customer services for one final attempt but they are now unable to honour the pm deal that my other sims are on cheapest is now therefore there is very little point moving from the existing provider poor show tesco a sorry experience and one that means i will leave and never return once my contracts have expired,Bad
387,i was kept waiting this morning by an engineer who failed to turn up to install a new modem for upgraded used the chat method of communicating which was slow and eventually transferred to the engineering took about half an hour they wanted to do health checks which i believe had already been done i asked for a phone or email response as to when a new engineers appointment could be made but was told to start the whole chat again because i had not responded enough i had thought the matter closed surely you can do better,Bad
388,i get no internet and a times no calls even though friends tell me the phone just rings the only time i get internet is in my house my and emails all come through when i get to my door swapped my sim with daughter and everything is fine ee are totally useless i wish id checked these reviews before i joined them im leaving them with or without the consent and they can whistle for any monies the try to get from me i should get a refund from them the crooks,Bad

390,today i contacted talktalk support via web chat i was contacting them to seek help with my broadband login details username and password this is not the same as access to my router the username should look something like and some password now i am with talktalk for the past numerous years and with my last contract renewal in place of username and password it simply says that use my previous one which i do not have since though the contract has continued for the past numerous years my tel number has changed anyway all the above i was trying to seek from tt so that i can use my own router in place of one provided by tt as that one does not cater for my whole house but sadly the person i was chatting with simply refused to make any effort and give me the information i was asking in fact i suggested to her if she could seek advice from her but noi am throughly disappointed with the service i today no just because i didnt get the information i was requesting but the tt simply made no effort to understand my query or get some help from her colleague and gave an impression as though she wasnt bothered about my query really sad am i expecting too much after all i have been with talk talk for years hope things improve on support,Bad
391,ive been with them for years because i couldnt be bothered to change over and use a pac code i wish id done it sooner as theyve always caused me problems one time while upgrading they sent me a new sim but then cancelled my new contract instead of my old contract and kept my old contract going and i didnt have a phone for two weeks until i tried my original sim to see if that still worked after finally leaving them two months later ive received a bill for my apple watch with should have been cancelled with my phone contract honestly the amount of time ive spent on hold with them and dealing with their awful automatic service is ridiculous,Bad
392,today i wanted to go to the national lottery website it was blocked by provided by talktalk i tried to change my safety settings and to access that i needed to change my password but the continue button on page did not activate i tried through my account on webmail but had a message there was a technical issue that they were trying to fix i tried several times which meant that talktalk blocked my account i also used the chat facility but the adviser who did try to assist was only able to send me a link to the same page i had already tried this was frustrating and time consuming over two hours in total this is not unusual with talktalk and they need to improve their systems,Bad
393,terrible download and upload speeds been upgraded and looked at or times now and is still terrible random disconnects every day alot of the time during when im in the middle of an online game or something important making me lose shocking i actually hate talktalk so much,Bad

397,totally disgusting my daughter ordered a mobile phone from you and it got delivered to the house while we we were on holiday so when we got back she checked our property and neighbours for said delivery but it was nowhere so she reported it to we have cctv on our house and when checked there was no delivery to our property none zero zilch yet the investigation you held with came to the conclusion it was the right address because the sat nav says so yes the sat nav and everyone knows how accurate sat are the delivery man said it was a white door well we certainly dont have a white door but do want help no they dont i feel like cancelling my account with you and ive been with you for years,Bad

399,wow how bad are they we were so close we were supposed to be installed today between pm and pm but no engineer showed up no phone call text email anything so we phoned them to see what had happened and to see when the engineer would fit us in were not unreasonable weve had a lot of snow here in devon and understand that this will significantly impact vm engineers but they gave us a date two weeks in the future vm missed their own date and time didnt bother to contact us to apologise and didnt even bend over backwards to fit us in within a few days we suggested before the th march when our day sky deadline is up by the time of their installation date well have had no active telephone line internet and tv with which to contact virgin media they just didnt get it or i suspect just didnt give two hoots they just offered us two free months great how about providing the service you promised or if not do your best to make it right if thats how they treat new customers can you imagine what the future has in store folks please look at the reviews its easy to criticise and hard to offer praise but it doesnt bode well when you look at all the reviews theres got to be something fundamentally wrong with vms customer service provision luckily weve got an alternative and they are sky phew,Bad
400,they are soo bad it is unbelievable ordered work in may months later nothing and we have paid s for people must lose their monopoly,Bad
401,after almost years as a loyal customer to talk talk they decide to double my bill and when i called them they said its because my contract has ended bit of a joke really that they advertise all these cheap prices yet it seems the new customers get the deals yet the loyal old customers get shafted and thats why the new ones get it so cheap the woman on the phone didnt have a clue what she was talking about first she told me i had added some phone boost funny how they had my phone number but couldnt make a call to discuss with me about renewing my contract and getting it cheaper disgusting company and no talk talk i am not chasing you if you read this and reply you can chase me you have my number use it like you should have done months ago,Bad
402,the business i have purchased had already talk talk installed but i have noticed that the connection was very poor the card reader was connected to the wifi but all the times failed always after or attempts poorly connected or simply dont so i switched to a new provider and let the talk talk know that i am the new business owner and dont wish to stay with talk talk the new provider after days the service gone live and talk talk still wouldnt let it go and billed me over while i was using other provider talk talk service is a joke please save your time and your money and you know what to avoid,Bad
403,at the end of last month april i started what would prove to be an easy shift from my current broadband provider to vodafone according to their website once i placed my order they would do everything there didnt appear to be a lot happening so last night i contacted them to see what the status was first attempt resulted me talking to a care in the community adviser obviously not a native english speaker he kept asking me for my vodafone mobile number even though i had told him on several occasions that i do not have a vodafone mobile and i was calling about home broadband eventually i told him that i didnt want to talk to him any longer and hung up he then called me back and again started to ramble on about needing my mobile number i again told him that i did not want to deal with him next attempt was by using online chat the adviser said that my previous provider had cancelled the transfer i contacted them this morning and they said not only had they not cancelled the transfer they had never received any contact from vodafone yet again this morning and their latest excuse was that open reach had informed them that a fault in my bt line had resulted in the transfer not going asked the adviser why i hadnt been informed about this and she had no a result of this experience i will not be switching to vodafone if they cannot handle a simple transfer i hate to think what would happen in the future if you required any technical are an absolute shambles of a company and do not deserve customers,Bad
404,horrible how long this problem will last,Bad
405,if you are thinking of changing to virgin media dont customer service is non existent i have been going round in circle for nearly months after having tv phone and broadband installed phone line still can not receive calls you dont get any call backs that have been promised and i cant get anyone to help i want to complain about the broad band coverage but i know i will just get angry with the lack of help i will be returning to sky as i always had great service and they have also tried to help me with the phone line,Bad
406,to chase payment and to disconnect the internet everything is straight foward and they have all the information but to reconnect and fix my fault they couldnt even find my personal information more than days without internet and they keep lying about when it will be fixed anmol karn and rakesh just keep lying about the reconnection and to keep me waiting they just said that my information wasnt matching so they could not confirm my account they only want your money not to provide a service,Bad
407,unfortunately i had to give one star to write this or they would have got nothing my husband has been given months to live and he contacted vodafone to try and sort his accounts and cut the package as hes self employed so things are now difficult they asked for proof of his illness so i sent a fitness to work form from his gp stating secondary liver cancer a few days later we received a letter stating that he didnt meet the criteria for critical illness they further stated the form wasnt adequate i had to ask his oncologist to write them a letter then try and get the critical illness team to deal with it my husband is out of the blue he is diagnosed with cancer he is dying and i have to literally have a breakdown on the phone to even get a response which was basically what is it you want do you want us to put the accounts in your name i at that point lost it and said my husband isnt dead yet and your lining me up to take over his accounts this company is the pits dont use them they have no customer care whatsoever im now fighting to get out of the contracts to go elsewhere,Bad
408,worst company i have had the pleasure to deal with ever even worse than scottish power,Bad
409,prospective customers be warned during your contract the price will be increased and when it comes to the end of your contract theyre not interested in retaining you only option ive just been given to renew is a bigger package at the same price im paying now which has ended up more than when i started the contract im looking for it to be cheaper and dont want more worse than that ive now been shunted to a cable care team my third chat with someone today over a hour period and the person i ended up with said bear with me im just going on a minute break fair they come back take minutes to ask simple security questions and once thats all done say sorry im off on lunch now im putting this chat back in the queue so now im having to start all over again they might do snazzy looking ads but once youre in expect the customer service,Bad
410,bad customer service im still not on the appropriate broadband speed for what i an paying no offer if a new router no apology letters or emails,Bad
411,i have no comments on the service provided the service was what you would expect from a broadband provider but dealing with their support was the worst experience ive ever had from a the service started they randomly disconnected my line due to an account error on their side and then i had to apply for a new connection even though i was online for a full forward a few years and i wanted to change provider i did call them asked for a cancellation customer support confirmed that my service would terminate in a months time all good got a new provider up and running but then i got billed from talk talk i phone them up again and they claimed that even though my service was terminated my account wasnt so i was billed normally for what seriously avoid this company but if you ever deal with them keep records of every interaction with their support youll probably need it down the line,Bad
412,absolutely poor customer like being called stupid and an soon as its feasible to cancel services and replace in house they are for months for manager to return call as they be sucked in by offers,Bad
413,total shambles only getting half the minimum speed that was promised since i joined in august spent almost hrs on phone since then to someone probably in india and still no further forward avoid at all costs,Bad
414,i have been with more than years as have all my family members i lost my job months ago so decided to put unlimited g on my phone as i could not afford my internet bill only for them to inform me after a week my data speed would be reduced i cannot even google anything as the speed is so slow i have had to go to my mothers house to post this review,Bad
415,the entire internet system at both my property is always broken and never working and am always having disrupted wifi i have had enough of this provider and will never recommend to no one ever again i have tried everything with them and not to mention no one ever picks up the phone to resolve my problem,Bad
416,i left vodafone for virgin media in march vodafone have since continued to charge me every single month since in august i spoke to vodafone they told me we closed your account down but our system overrode it and opened a brand new one for you how that is possible and how that could even get past an audit i do not know apparently they closed that account down too no they did not as i have been billed twice since that have tried to ask the online chat people for a telephone number to call because this clearly goes beyond being able to rapidly get to the point of the issue through a small box in a web browser two people i spoke to not once did they answer my question regarding a telephone number and i asked five times literally every single time they asked a different question from meso here i am day of trying to resolve the issue and i cannot resolve it the website and staff purposefully put blockers in your path i want to speak to a person so i can detail exactly the issue the dates times bills and the resolution i i already complained ill be heading to ofcom,Bad
417,the wifi is was promised a promotion of credit on my account when i joined which didnt appear i finally got it after hours and hours on the phone to the call centre i was paid out last month i joined virgin in december overall very poor service,Bad

419,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
420,got a call from the enhancement team who said they would give me a better deal than any other person in virgin media the rep told me what they were giving me which wasnt that good basically just tying me in for another months when i told them i didnt want to change contract as i plan to leave at the end of my contract the rep kept talking right over the top of me as she couldnt believe i wasnt taking the rubbish deal offered i had to demand her to listen to stop her talking the deals offered to loyal customers like me are terrible my so recently moved out and is paying half of what i pay terrible service for existing customers even with a so called discount,Bad
421,useless company i have a new year sim only contract and yesterday i got a random call from some random uk number asking who i am and when i replied whos this she replied you just called me and stated i have been in some sort of insurance fraud this call wasnt made by me or my phone but yet it was my number today i woke up and was told i am being charged for texting abroad again this wasnt me i then went on the chat to discuss i want my contract ended they stated i would cost i shouldnt have to pay for my contract to be ended when this is the companies fault my phone number is being used by someone else on a different phone im getting these charges to my phone that wasnt me i spent hour minutes on the online live chat and transferred to different people who all listened and kept going on acting as if they could help and are going to look into it to be told that it wasnt in their area to cancel my contract without the fee bearing in mind after each person i was connected to the person previous said they were going to transfer me to the right team people later and hour and mins later i was told sorry this isnt the right department and you need to call the fraud team as theyre the only ones who can do this if i was told this at the beginning i wouldve have time to call them but now theyre shut they all knew when being connected to me my problem and they still carried on saying theyre going to look into it and then stating mins later that this isnt their department and they cant help why not tell me that at the beginning when you knew what i was clearly here for there should be something in the fine print or by law saying i should be able to cancel my contract if its the companies fault my number is being used to contact people about fraud i do not want to stay with this company i do not have the time to deal with this and potentially deal with it again and again if i stay with this company i want out and i should be able to as i dont want to leave for a me reason its a vodafone reason i signed up to a month contract but i didnt sign up to these problems no where in the contract or fine print did it say i will have problems like this or there could potentially be problems like this and if i were aware of this potentially happening i would not of agreed to sign up i should be able to have my contract ended without no fee as the reason i want to end is bcos the ongoing issues im having i did not sign a contract that has these serious issues this contract cancellation fee should be free as this is a serious matter from vodafone and matters like this wasnt stated in my contract that i signed up for someone is using my number to do with fraud this is a very very serious matter and i can get in a lot of trouble as it would link back to me i dont want a new number that isnt solving anything when this can happen again by being with this company and i dont have the time to deal with stuff like this and if i did have the time i shouldnt have to waste it on this awful company awful service please stay well i rang the fraud team and they told me it wasnt their department to help either lol so whos is it who can help i have spoke to everyone cant deal,Bad
422,i cancelled my virgin media account because i moved out at the same address someone signed a new contract but virgin keep sending me bills it is impossible to get through because they do not understand what is explained to them zero communication with the customer a disaster not a company,Bad

424,i have a lot of trouble signing in im locked out i cant use my phone and all the time i am losing out on my monthly credit to get hold of them they are not hr and you can only get them by email,Bad
425,virgin media must be one of the worst isps mb service regularly provides speeds of between to mbs which means i can seldom watch bbc iplayer without constant so called customer support is appalling with the stock response being were upgrading the service and it will all be sorted out in about six weeks time ive heard this more times than i can remember and the service doesnt improve customer bs would be a far more accurate media are rubbish but then again the competition appear to be no better with customer satisfaction surveys of uk isps showing high levels of dissatisfaction across the thats alright then theres no need to offer a good service when no one else about time the organisations that monitor these things took them to task and made them do something about it to take peoples money without offering the advertised service is simply dishonest although virgin media seem to think this is a perfectly acceptable way to run their on an update to my original weeks ago virgin media supplied a new router telling me the slow internet speeds would be made no difference and when i phoned to find out why i was told that there were ongoing problems that would be sorted out by october th instead of the mbs speeds i should be getting i have been getting on average between and just called again to find out why nothings changed and have once again been told that there are ongoing problems which will be resolved sometime in is how virgin media operate one lie after another given their past history when nothing changes in november itll be the same old line weve got ongoing problems and a promise that it will be resolved in december january february march april etc virgin media at all costs theyre a thoroughly dishonest company,Bad
426,i really regret transferring to virgin everything is inferior to sky i was sold a package that was illegal and even after cancellation of the o free sim card they are still sending me bills the virgin go is so complicated you really need a philadelphia lawyer to understand it staff who promised help have all let me down no dissatisfied no star verdict,Bad
427,i thought the nightmare with virgin media was over when we left but instead of getting the credit they owed me they have just sent a new bill months after leaving not unsurprisingly it is because they have sent the return packaging to the old address rather than the one we gave them they managed to send the billing letter to the correct address but have now tried to charge us for not returning the equipment we had a total nightmare with virgin and would strongly advise anyone to avoid like the plague we have been with ee since and the difference in customer service is massive,Bad
428,been a payg customer for years took out a contract and within hours my daughter said it wasnt the right contract i cancelled the contract immediately within hours of signing up what a shambles advisors who clearly didnt want to make it easy misinformation etc fortunately my daughter took screenshots of all after speaking to three advisors i was told the contract had been cancelled however the phone has been despatched and i should refuse delivery when it arrived dpd came two days later and my husband refused delivery ten days after cancelling i still havent received a refund i registered a complaint on thursday an advisor came back to me first thing yesterday morning asking for further details which i provided and since then ive heard can despatch a phone within hours but cant process a refund in am profoundly deaf and cannot use voice calls which a tesco are aware of it would seem this is something they are using to ignore me horrendous customer service will now have to raise a complaint with the regulator,Bad

439,one hour on hold to report a stolen phone at p for landlines i can only imagine what it cost on my only other phone a work mobile i feel like ive been a victim of crime twice in the same ive found the service ok but unfortunately that level of delay is totally unsatisfactory for any company let alone a telecoms company and overrides any other feelings i have towards the company alas it seems that other mobile companies share a similar disdain for its customers as they all seem to rate very low and where is the incentive to improve when they can get away with providing shoddy service,Bad
440,awful i have problem with my network i call for service are completely sleeping while you talk to give you no attention at all they mute you and you feel like talking to bad are literally whispering while they talk for some my experience the only thing is good about this company is the fact they have cheap bundles but overall i dont recommend it at all i would rather to pay more than meeting that type of customer service,Bad

496,we have had ongoing issues with virgin media but today was the height of all called a virgin media technician to increase our broadband speed he came at pm and spent time doing whatever it was he needed to do my mum was dealing with him so i am unaware of exactly what he did after spending a few hours he said that he will have to come back the next day at pm to check the internet speed but the internet has been turned on and it should start within the next minutes but as it was late and he still had another jobs to go he wanted to leave half an hour later no internet we called virgin media and the lady on the phone said there was nothing she could do not even get a technician in the morning instead of afternoon our home security and heating is connected to the internet we explained that we had arrangements to go out in the evening and that the next morning my father was due to work from home and we needed the internet to ensure the home security system was working and that my dad could work from home after a bit of discussion with the lady from virgin media she said that she could provide us we pay per month to virgin media for a constant service of good we returned from our arrangement in the evening at pm on a cold winter night my father did some investigation and realised that he broke a cable that was working perfectly fine and left to me that screams we asked the lady at virgin media to give us the name of the technician she didnt know we asked her to send someone out at am the next day she couldnt do it we asked her for the reference number to the call that we were making she didnt have that she was basically wasting our time if she didnt have a solution she should have said that she was taking our money and not providing this is not the first time that virgin media have used their empty brain to ruin our day we were supposed to go on holiday and my mother and i tried to check in for the flights only to find out that we had yep you guessed internet we were not warned about this before hand and had to make our way to the local library waste our time and money and sort our things out many times we have had issues where i have been on an important work meeting and they have turned off the local wifi doing improvements in your area dear virgin media please improve your customer service before improving internet service contacting them is also a nightmare the virgin media account is under my fathers name and if h is not home we cant even get anyone on the phone to make a complaint or fix the issue i have currently been trying to make a complaint through our account but for the last mins it have been on a webpage that simply says logging ini dont want to keep wasting my mobile data when we pay for wifi at home but the compensation doesnt really cover that now does it in the house we have over electronic devices that require wifi and in this day and age internet is a necessity i am simply disappointed because albeit mistakes were made everyone is human and i understand even i make mistakes its all about how you fix the mistake virgin media have done nothing to fix their mistakes yet they charge us for a service that they are not providing,Bad
497,talk talk is the worst company i ever dealt with i have no now more than weeks i had spent more than hours on the phone with their team been promised a new router times nothing arrived and if i want to cancel it will cost me pounds and then they sent me an invoice for pounds for the period i have no internet then i regret to sign up with on them very poor customer service,Bad
498,absolute con artists didnt honour a deal weeks on still trying to get some sense out of the complaints department they are patronising and insulting and lack common sense john caerphilly virgin salesman is a complete con man who didnt record our deal and put my contact details in wrong so i had no idea what was coming,Bad
499,o just make it hard to pay them the remaining settlement fee think its just so they can squeeze every penny from there customer base having to wait days then an extra days just to cut you offi paid upfront to get a contract with o but unfortunately the connection was terrible cutting out on business calls family top that off it seemed impossible to change the dates for when the money comes out because majority of the staff members are pretty my bill was supposed to be a month but i started getting charged to a month for a sim that didnt work it actually worked out cheaper to cut off all tariffs paying only a month then having a second sim with smarty for a month unlimited due to the prices constantly increasing i tried to terminate the contract in the first months of having it trust me the staff members made it wouldnt recommend o if you want anything reliable,Bad
500,nothing wrong with the internet but direct debit has been a changed my billing date and the person on whatsapp assured me it was all sorted but today i have been charged for my old direct debit date and its the incorrect credit for my package has not been included and im over drawn in my bank and my new direct debit is still due to be has caused me stress and theres no easy way to contact virgin im going to switch to a new provider,Bad

503,would not use i could have given no stars i would hadnt even become a customer service was absolutely dire so cancelled the contract,Bad
504,the worst customer service by far had horrible experience with a mandy and a lady named this company is nothing than frauds i was offered a package for from the st billing it was always to we call to resolve it they lie today when we called they say the package has gone up as we are using land line we dont have never get anything from them worst experience ever they will offer a cheaper package and bill you more,Bad
505,i have been very unhappy with intermittent service dropouts and slower speeds than advertised im locked in a year contract unfortunately,Bad
506,virgin transferred me to o and my tariff went up by a third absolute barrage of spam texts and emails which i could not unsubscribe from because i got an error message every time voicemail emergency alerts and text message sounds enabled without my consent logging into my account involved being sent an authentication code every single time i moved to a new provider at half the price for better data and i have since then received spam from o telling me to enjoy some alleged benefits,Bad
507,customer support is they hang up on sell fiber install coaxial should be a false advertisement pay for a speed and get half of it then they refer you to tc telling you that you get what you signed for utter,Bad

509,we live in a small village near colchester and have no choice but to use bt broadband getting it installed when we moved it years ago was not the easiest but it eventually worked and we were happy enough about months ago it stopped working the speed was after a series of phone calls an engineer came around unannounced but luckily i was home that morning he very quickly understood what the issue was got it fixed all good but in december on boxing day the same issue again unusable after a series of phone calls and patronising questions about our installation bt agreed to send someone over appointment missed we later found out the engineer was trying to contact us on our landline we have never used that line not even once to make a call or receive one for that matter youd expect bt to know that then about a week later an engineer shows up unannounced again lucky i was home he runs a few tests on the line and explain theyll need to send out a hoist to fix the problem hopefully tonight or tomorrow of course no hoist so we got back on the phone theyll be there on thursday nothing on thursday get back on the phone sorry theyll be there on sunday finally glimmer of hope this morning the hoist was here and goes away and guess what no broadband still however an email from by saying the issue has been fixed but you will have guessed still no broadband its now been a month may be these reviews are monitored and our case can be escalated,Bad
510,after contacting several times with so many different agents over the phone i managed to transfer my number to another customer dry and unfriendly call center they even refused me to provide my pac number i was seconds to report to trading standards due this min waiting for the call and then and lazy staff plus call center based on nowhere when you say you are going to report them then the make up a name to get away from iti am glad i work in the social media business as an influencer my experience will help others to stay away from this company,Bad
511,avoid avoid bb,Bad
512,im finally out of their hellhole latest bill was of and that was only broadband no landline or tv or anything just basic wifi but with awful internet connection,Bad
513,ive had numerous problems with vodafone like you wouldnt believe but talking to their highest point of escalation is even worse they blame other companies never take responsibility and if youre looking for an apology try a big rock better chances there they took out out of my account without notifying me it took me different calls after being hung up on cold transferred when asked to speak to a manager and then refused a manager but another transfer to tell me it was wrongly charged like i didnt know that already and it would take them working days to refund heres the best bit the reason why it would take so long is because the bank review the money coming in what a load of bs their highest escalation team talk about what qualifications theyve got and how theyve received bad service from another company amazon like i care give me my money and deal with the incompetent staff stay away from this company worst service ive ever received,Bad
514,we have had no broadband now for days and have been told it could take up to another three days to get it back an engineer was booked to come out i waited in and no one came no communication from virgin to say the call had been cancelled you call customer services and wait for up to mins for you call to be answered they then say ill speak to the support team and put you on hold which basically means im going to hang up on you with no call back and then the cycle of the customer customer service starts again the service is ridiculous im cancelling my roaming contract as for the price i currently pay i expect a much better service i would never recommend virgin to anyone,Bad
515,absolutely disgusting customer service was notified about being booked in for a upgrade to future fibre broadband via text that i had previously advised i didnt want a few months ago but clearly had booked it in without any consideration to what i requested live chat was awful just kept getting told that because my area a future fibre area they couldnt deal with me as im a future fibre customer which im not as my package hadnt been upgraded and they gave me a number to a line that was closed tried contacting via the number on facebook and that wouldnt connect sent a message via messenger and they did get back to me a few hours later but still couldnt deal with me as they didnt have the system to deal with my request so gave me another number to call which i managed to get through on but the woman i spoke to didnt seem to know what she was doing as she had to keep putting me on hold i could hardly hear her as her microphone was so noisy and she was clearly getting frustrated with the fact i couldnt hear her so maybe talktalk should provide their telephone operatives with decent the appointment did get cancelled in the end with a weak apology and a very rude and abrupt hang up at the end of the call think customer service training needs to be given and respect for customers needs to be learnt without trying to force customers in to getting upgraded packages that they dont want what a bullying company with no respect for customers at all i wont be renewing my contract at all,Bad
516,would not recommend from personal experience,Bad
517,this company is an absolute joke when i signed up on the nd of january for virgin i was asked do i want a amazon voucher or bill credit i chose amazon voucher its now the th of march and still received nothing so i rang them today to try sort it i got through to sarah from india and she just left me on a silent hold for ages and the phone went dead so i rang back up and got through to david from india and he was going to sort it so he transferred me to a lovely lady from scotland and she said she would add it as bill credit so i said thats fine so she went to speak to her manager and once again the phone went dead i then rang up another times trying to speak to someone in the uk as they are very helpful so i finally got through to someone in the uk on the team and she said i need speak to another department so she transferred me to the options on the phone and the only option that was relevant to me was the sales team but that turned out to be the wrong option so i said can i be put through to the complaints team as this is beyond a joke now i got through to a lady and told her what has and it was as if she didnt want to know so i said put me through to the cancellations department as i want to cancel my contact as i signed up under false pretences im now told i have to get in contact with amazon itself regarding the matter im not been funny but i didnt sign up to i signed up to virgin media im now waiting for a manager call back which i doubt will happen finally got a call back from chris the manager in the team just outside of glasgow what an absolute he was talking over me arguing with me and just been a pure he basically said they sent an email containing the voucher in february which i havent received and because its still showing as live they cant do anything they can see i havent redeemed it but wont do anything about it what a joke,Bad
518,big companies have always got someone else to blame but this is a true reflection of and the management i have been on the same contract with now for the last years recently ive been back and forth with now for the last months ive had problem after problem i set up a direct debit with them after my mother canceled her phone on a two phone contract set up i took the over the remaining phone the agent told me i was going to receive documentation after setting up my direct debit to confirm and nothing weeks down the line was receiving messages off the company telling me il get cut off if i dont contact them for outstanding speaking to an agent she told me the outstanding balance and i repeatedly told her i set up a direct debit i told her you have my card details why have you not honoured your agreement and taken monthly payments she then continuously repeated herself and kept asking me for my card number to pay over the phone i was uncomfortable and she kept talking over me she said she cant see them and probably the agent previously i spoke to didnt set up a direct debit and go through with it as you can imagine i was furious at this point where i was then asking to speak to a manager she kept asking me why and i kept asking politely for a manager i told her all calls are recorded cant you listen to the previous call and call me back the agent told me theres no managers to where she told me pay one off and il knock it off next months bill as a goodwill gesture frustrated and fed up i agreed as i felt like she was persistent in not getting me to speak to a manager i wasnt getting anywhere i felt pressured this call was on friday th of september today is nd of october and i have received text messages off one after the other all stating different things ive opted out of voicemail ive turned off text updates for data removed data roaming limit all of this i have not requested i called agent where he told me its okay and i only have blocked international calls the agent kept telling me this is okay nothing is wrong when all i wanted to know is why have i had all these changes and who made them why am i receiving messages off your company i requested to speak to a manager where he told me no theres not one here like the other agent continued to asked why where i told him i want to speak to them about my account to make a complaint he then put me on hold and told me i cant theres no one there i had to request a call back when one is available no doubt i will not get one i am at my wits end there are no procedures no company structure its a company that love to promote that their all about the customer when the reality is far from that i can not wait until my contract ends as i will be leaving i am going to spread my experience with everyone i know as are not loyal to their customers and seem to apparently have no managers,Bad
519,i strongly do not recommend anyone to become involved with vodafone me and my mother have had a joint contract for years when i left home we went into our local shop to discuss taking out separate contracts in the shop this is what we discussed i believe i was massively mislead i left that shop with no sim card no it was not given to me but they did have my bank details they then activated that account without me knowing without me having the actually sim card they did not send it in the post they did not call me to inform me it was there they then charged me i received again no letters no emails regarding any payments i then suddenly get a email that after missing two payments it has been handed over to a debt collectors i called vodafone they firstly told me not to worry there is no contract in my name or to my address she then checked again and told me that the sim card had been activated and i could not cancel the contract because it was over the day cooling off period dispite he store not contacting me in those days bare in mind im already in a contract with my mother so vodafone where charging me two contracts it was to leave that contract or to go into the shop and collect the sim card why didnt they inform me of this earlier why did i receive no formal letter regarding miss payments i was of i have never missed a payment in my life why did i not get informed i was being handed over to a debt collectors i was completely unaware and why couldnt they just deactivate this unused account granted one of the ladies i spoke to was very helpful and ensured me that she was to contact the debt collectors and ensure it does not go on my credit file however i am still waiting to here back from the i asked for it in writing i am so unsatisfied with how deceitful vodafone are if i had the money to leave the contract i would and i would never take a contract out with them again nor do i recommend anyone else doing so also just to add i answered the feed back text messages regarding a gentlemen i spoke to prior to the lady i scored his customer service but scored a with would i recommend to a friend as why would i he then left me a very rude abrupt voice mail while i was at work asking me why i was so dissatisfied when he had explained everything to me and that he wants to know why absolutely disgraceful,Bad
520,i have been a virgin media costumer for over years and every year i have haggle with them over the contract renewal price and the service is getting worse and not year i took out better broadband speed and paid higher price and was still for a new router to do customer are given lot better deals than exiting costumers even half the price of existing waiting time for customers have got longer and longer and they seem to put this blame on instead sorting out the very poor service they provide,Bad
521,i am not currently with talktalk but i used be with them before i moved over to bt however bt is due to end on th january so i am now searching for a new provider and considered talktalk yet again because of the price i thought that i would read recent reviews first and i am astounded that talktalk have not in any way shape or form changed the way they do business and handle complaints etc in four years since i was with them it is sad that of the reviews are poor or bad in my opinion the lowest star should be very bad and the second bad because i have experienced most of the same problems and more when i was with them so obviously i will be giving them a wide berth and possibly staying with bt if i cant get a provider that delivers a good service a reasonable price thank god for reviews i recommend that everybody checks out reviews before they buy to the directors of talktalk i say take the blinkers from your eyes its not all about profit its about supplying a good service including customer services setting goals and standards of excellence within your organisation and your product do what it says on the tin by way of a little experiment look at what you have on offer from the point of view of a prospective customer read the reviews check out your competition then ask yourself would i be happy with all that talktalk have to offer good luck you for your reply amanda but i have to say to your remark we do have lots of customers who share positive experiences and are happy with their services i just carried out a quick survey of your first five trust pilot pages with on each page and the results were st page bad to poor average poor nd page bad excellent rd page bad great to excellent th page bad to poor great to excellent finally page bad to poor great to excellent out of a grand total of reviews there are negative remarks and just positive as a percentage that represents of people viewing the reviews posting negative remarks about talktalk most people would not look beyond five pages before they make an informed decision to look elsewhere for their service provider,Bad
522,omg i paid for very bad service i have a free view with virgin a few channels for im receiving uc they left me with no you can avoid them,Bad
523,if i could give no stars i would i have tried to cancel my two year contract after it ended in march i have tried on three separate occasions to cancel however i am continually when ive been told my contract is cancelled customer services are very rude and attitude which is not helpful when you are already frustrated by the service i would never recommend this company to friends or family get me back to o,Bad
524,do not go with they changed my home telephone number without telling me then i gave them notice of leaving in november but it has taken till now to actually get away from then i have been with a better company for a couple of months and talktalk informed me that i owed them lots of monies as i had two services running which i never ever knew not go with them,Bad
525,terrible customer service as soon my contract expires i will change,Bad
526,after visits the last technician detected a problem with the signal strength which he could not correct and assured me someone else would attend however there has been no further contact,Bad
527,only star as they dont give an option for or negative even star is really pushing it if you want a company that values customers that has a customer service team that will listen to you and that understands you then go elsewhere this has to be the worst company i have ever dealt with customer services team act like actually listen to anything you say and just repeat themselves over and over again even although it has nothing to do with what you have asked absolute nightmare so many other better companies to use,Bad
528,stay awayi would have put stars if been with mobile for month the bundle didnt renew and they blamed it on me not setting up my account properly even though in the same calls they confirm that everything is set up that my query would be rectified by pm on saturday for the time to pass and nothing had changed apart form the credit on my account that i was told would be sufficient and used to reinstate my bundle was course the advisor knew it wouldnt be fixed and that customer services dont open again until monday at am hours without a function the meantime i received a text message from telling me that my query have been it called back at am on to be told i would be transferred straight to a supervisor who could rectify the issue i waited on a ringing line for hours at which point the line was called back to customer services and was assured i would get a call back within hour but if it didnt happen i could call back and ask for him i waited and the call never came so ai called back and asked him no we cant go the same blame speech all over again and was promised i would passed over directly to a supervisor before letting her transfer me i specifically asked for confirmation that i was going straight to speak to someone and i would not have to wait on hold yes of course absolute rubbish i am now on a ringing line yet getting a phone call from a agent i was told that my bundle had been reinstated as it should have been from the apology for the horrendous service and inconvenience but instead asked to edit my review to show stars and positive comments may have reinstated my bundle but theyve taken money out of my bank without my permission to do so,Bad
529,would never recommend or use virgin media ever again firstly was agreed to a contract of a month they fail to tell you though that you will be charged a activation charge which is ridiculous an activation charge for plugging it in the wall yourself ridiculous secondly the team at virgin media seem not capable of inputting a date on their system for direct debits to go out i agreed a specific date every month twice i had to phone up as they had taken payment on a complete incorrect and not agreed date lastly after ringing up to cancel my virgin media and having been transferred through to different people one of which didnt even know i was the customer and presumed i was a virgin media employee which is very unprofessional i eventually got to cancel my contract that had thankfully just not be using virgin media ever again they seem to bothered about the quantity of customers they have rather than looking after the quality their existing customers are supplied with jack,Bad
530,we joined virgin media in october after learning about their high speed fibre connection we planned an install with them at the end of october which got delayed until early november as a site survey showed they needed to do some cable work in the street before they could connect to the house fast forward to december no work has been completed despite appointments to have the work done with no one turning up multiple complaints to the customer service team formal complaints submitted and still no resolution had an email in december to say my install has now been push to february with work booked for the rd jan no surprise the pre work did not happen on the rd jan so i am expecting the february date to be pushed once again weve now lodged a complaint with the ombudsman we have tried multiple times to contact virgin customer service but all that happens is they direct you to another team and then they hang up after keeping you on hold for over an hour in one instance i was assured that the team would do the work before pm on the given day i asked who i could call when it got to pm and no work had been done and the gentleman on the phone kindly informed me i could call the team i asked what time they finish and the answer was pm how helpful,Bad
531,so here is a true experience of my association with virgin media over years and being a loyal july i advised vm that i will be moving to a permanent place so on phone i was told that there is vm service provided to existing resident so it can not be transfered til they move and i knew the person living was on ee not on vm but i accepted and informed them after a week i call back to be told that the search they did was for flat not the flat surprised aint finally they accepted to forgo the moving charges because of their error the moving the dates were not coinciding but after wait of weeks finally i had broadband installed the shock came later with a massive bill of for which i had to make numerous calls chats to get it right i am sure if the customer is sleeping the vm could end up charging anything under the excuse of the system was not updated for a moment i thought if i was not vigilant i would have ended up paying bombshell amount of nearly x my package price i dont understand why virgin media has gone from being the best to worst in years what i have been with vm,Bad
532,i have been trying to cancel my account with talktalk for several days and they keep saying that there is a system issue and cannot process my request very handy a manager in the retention team was supposed to call me and never did great top of that i dont have broadband service because of a fault they cannot fix at the moment so i keep paying for a service i dont receive and cannot leave the company after years with talktalk is very sad and frustrating to see that when needed there is not customer service or any lack of consideration to a previously loyal weeks later i am still unable to cancel my account this is ridiculous i sent a couple of emails complaining to the address they have for complaints but no acknowledgement experience ever,Bad
533,bad value bad customer service bad provide us with broadband for weeks then after chasing said weeks so i closed the account virgin offered to waive the for leaving them now send us many bills still trying to take money even though weve been with bt since mid july,Bad
534,the engineer arrived and i asked him to put the new box in the same place as the old one he said it wasnt possible and without much discussion placed it in a bedroom at the front of the house in a corner own website says it should be placed in the centre of the house so this wasnt the case when another engineer came he said it wasnt in the best place and it would be perfectly possible to put it where i wanted it wont change the position without charging me although one of their staff put it in a poor position,Bad
535,my father passed away in july and despite contacting their bereavement team who incidentally are helpful my mother continues to receive threatening letters due to none payment causing her unnecessary upset and anxiety at a time when she is already grieving when i call to query im advised just to ignore them theres nothing to pay but in this day and age i dont understand why you cant implement a system to stop this sort of communication going out in these circumstances its too late for us now but hope they may be able to implement something to prevent others going through the same distress in the future,Bad
536,was sent letter saying needed to up grade system fitted new modem and router router needed app to work didnt have smart phone so router wouldnt work was sent another router this didnt work was told possible modem fault had new one fitted still didnt work was sent another router got it all set up when modem fell of wall pulling out fibre wire reported it had no reply for days so had enough of being passed for to talk talk saying it was each others fault so i had no internet from may june cancelled account gone with another company had internet up and running in hours,Bad
537,appalling service my partner had been a customer of virgin for a few years we recently moved but they werent available in the area we were moving to so said there would be a refund of the cancellation fee if we provided evidence of the new requested we sent them the necessary information to prove the new address five times but this was ignored hours of waiting on the phone with no response all the while they sent reminders for us to send the info until finally the deadline this added to the overpriced service makes it impossible to recommend them shameful,Bad
538,absolutely shocking company i bought a sim from them on the understanding that it was on a month rolling contract but two days after i activated it i got an email telling me i was being moved onto a month contract when i tried to remove my bank card details their system would not let me so i had to cancel the payment from the banks end the sim card worked okay until i mentioned cancellation then the data rate dropped from mbs to second even though i was only days into my months online chat was quick but they went to school in in a town called denial first of all they denied that it was a month contract really month pay in advance then when i screenshot the original advert they just ignored they denied there was a problem with the data rate on the sim even though there is a speed readout on my phone showing summary just stay away from this company to stop being either ripped off or into a contract you dont want or treated like an idiot,Bad
539,i have had an account with for two years during that time i constantly argued with them to register my account with the credit reference agencies they refused saying that they would know my payment history at the time of upgrade i decided to upgrade so long as they migrated my account to vodafone i spoke on the phone to michael for an hour and twenty minutes going over the same details again and again he struggled to grasp simple ideas such as i would like to collect from my local store please not hard i then tried online and was told i needed to contact michael again and complete his process an hour and forty five minutes later i was complete michael relayed all of the details back to me said phone was being delivered to my house and i needed to pay postage and had wrong bank details screamed blue murder and asked for manager manager phoned and apologised and issues phone was delayed due mistakes which michael made on application avoid at all costs,Bad
540,customer service is a abysmal avoid virgin media if possible,Bad
541,the order they arrived to install didnt match what i ordered online slower broadband only one box and no sport hd i myself up for customer services as i know from when trying to cancel at the last house that this is not an easy job if we had the option between sky and virgin itd be sky every time unfortunately our estate is locked into virgin,Bad
542,awful company moved to a new house and was promised broadband and telephone on june over a month later still not connected to either keeps delaying or not completing works required talk talk and blaming each other no formal complaints procedure available as will only deal with the service provider not the public talk talk doing their best to escalate issues but is incompetent and cannot complete works giving one excuse after another days ago talk talk informed me that needed them to cancel the original order and start a new one no reason given today has told talk talk that there is no need to cancel the original order they will keep the old order open you cant make this stuff up now want to send an engineer to my home for the third time fine another day off work for this issue to be sorted but the previous two times an engineer came to the house they said all internal works had been completed this was over three weeks ago again have no idea what they are doing is incompetent and negligent i have now been without internet or landline for over a month i have elderly parents i need to contact daily not to mention the normal banking and utilities to set up as i have moved home is an absolute disgrace and not fit for purpose,Bad
543,online service support tickets never answered,Bad
544,i have trying to recharge my mobile service i have not been able to do so after speaking with your customer service they told me on analysing our records we could see that the transaction you have attempted was not successful due to random system checks in order to protect our customers online transactions from fraudulent transactions so to fix the problem i had to email a c of my credit card and photo id i have emailed my credit card details and a copy of my id to your support team days ago and have still not had my credit card details verified even though i was told to wait hours after waiting hour i customer service who after waiting over min on hold they hung up on me lucky for me i have nothing better to do with my time so after recalling the support team and waiting on hold for another minutes again your customer service hangs up on me i then go onto your online chat support and after taking the time to type out exactly my problem my problem is due to security checks my purchase is being declined they just leave the not go with this company,Bad
545,the compatible with all isp hubs doesnt work for bt whole home premium wifi and a virgin super hub the wired disc disconnects every couple of hours requiring reboot when it works the wifi is great in terms of reach and speed when it drops out during its a cant get anyone to help solve the problem im not happy,Bad
546,bt are really good at transferring your account from your existing provider i grant you that but then the service stops thereafter a week of being with bt the first thing to go was the land the tv started to freeze repeatedly with the lost wifi connection error message showing helpfully against a black the same time it became impossible to connect have to manually reconnect my ipad iphone and laptop everytime i want to access the internet or joining bt is like technology slowly eroding from my life and i am now back circa has anyone tried to contact bt customer service it is the narnia style wardrobe into little britain sez no thats some serious magic people my advice to you is for you to leave me behind and to save it took me three attempts at loading this review,Bad
547,in november it will be the end of my months contract with o i pay a month which is completely fine if the network connection data and reception was not so utterly or data will often be slow or lost even while i am the price i pay i expect better network service i have emailed a complaint which i have no doubt will probably fall into the delete bin as i will not be a returning this day and age this should not be a yourself money and the stress do not join o regardless of what deal they give not worth a disappointment these type of companies should be closed down,Bad
548,i have tried times over last weeks to order broadband also to correct overcharging on my account for my mobile will not bore you with the details but stay away the support service is completely dysfunctional will only make your blood pressure go through the roof and cause you problems they lie and blame technology simply not good enough stay away fir your own sanity and personal health,Bad
549,still have no broadband after my home move this was meant to be connected from the over hours on the phone since three separate engineers could not find the fault customer service and technical support have not idea what the problem is engineers advised to order new hub as that might fix the issue it did not and then bt send a letter advising if i do not return the hub that i did not even want i may be fined promised call backs that i have never received asked to make a complaint over the phone on two occasions but would not let me as issue ongoing have submitted a written complaint but not surprisingly this have not even been reviewed yet i have now had to move in with my in laws as office closure means i have to work from home and have no internet i have chased and chased to no avail customer service and treatment of your clients is appalling but i have to incur a fee to end the contract early to go with a competent broadband provider who can actually provide the required service you have no issue or interest in dealing with the complaints raised or fixing the broadband issue hopefully the ombudsman has a different opinion,Bad
550,live chat got me nowhere been without mail for over a week all they said was an engineer will contact me in days,Bad
551,chat team asking for transfer and then just write on top thank dont know the solution,Bad
552,i wrote a review and suddenly it has disappeared i had issues with talk talk and the free sim the customer service knowledge is shocking it use to be a brill company that resolved issues promptly i had an issue with the mobile not telling me that i had gone over then charged me i contacted the chat customer service they passed me back and forth and they kept me over an hour in the end they said we cant help you i wrote a review they said i would be contacted asap and surprise surprise nothing days ago they say contact us via twitter and my sim has stopped working no g,Bad
553,after trying for days to speak to a human i ended up having a whatsapp message text with someone the person was helpful and i explained i had tried everything recommend on many occasions and my connection was still coming and going she got an engineer for a few days later and he checked everything and said it was fine but to get signal boosters i have done this and the signal is still so bad tv programs cut off and this is wired with an ethernet cable my boys are also having a nightmare with there devices daily upstairs with the virgin pod wired to a pc and a booster box i bought i would like someone to contact me to end my contract as i feel you have not given me the service i pay for but try as have been i dont have enough hrs in the day to sit on the phone whatsapp email to get,Bad
554,i have been a loyal customer of bt for years and because i have decided to close my account with them due to my illness and having to shut my shop and give up my livelihood they are billing me for over and im absolutely disgusted about this the main reason that i am writing this review is to prevent potential future customers of bt being treated this terribly clearly people are just statistics and numbers to this company and nothing more i strongly recommend that people go elsewhere for broadband and telephone ect,Bad
555,i suspect ee probably stands for enough good news is our escape today from this unpleasant uncaring outfit their excellent customer service claim is a hollow boast in my experience ee couldnt care less and thats generous the startling high rate of crummy reviews on trustpilot should serve as a grave warning ee is not awful and is worse to preserve your avoid avoid stuart kuttner,Bad
556,the internet is very poor as soon as you leave the room the box is in the internet doesnt work,Bad
557,just wanted to get to my emails used the online chat yesterday and told all would be ok by am still having issues nearly hours on chat line are polite but endless questions without any real help another plus minutes wasted,Bad

563,i had to give one star to be able to leave feedback if i could i would of given a minus score i have been waiting days for a repair the engineer came out on the first day to make it safe snapped overhead cable he said hed not been given job to repair as well just to make safe although he didnt seem to know why ten days on multiple calls to my provider to try and find out what is happening they are receiving the run around from who just keep saying it will be fixed tomorrow but tomorrow never comes just been on to my provider and they have once again been told the damage will be fixed tomorrow im not holding my breath absolutely appalling service as they are the ones who have the monopoly on this work it seems they can do what they like without redress,Bad
564,awful service been with virgin media for broadband only for a couple of years and i am paying quite a lot monthly for the service last year i couldnt stream anything or work from home as the speed was so slow when i spoke to vm they said that my router was out of date even though it was only a year old and that they need to send another one since then the problems have persisted and i called them again today they performed a speed check and my wifi speed was mbps however when connected via ethernet the speed was i was told that it was due to my device being far away from the hub however i went and sat next to it and the speed didnt alter it is so slow you cant watch a youtube video also we have tried to watch films and it says the broadband width is too i said i want to cancel as i am paying nearly a month for a really poor service but they said that when i accepted the new hub in september i verbally signed a new month contract so if i want to cancel i have to pay over to do so even though they arent providing a suitable service i tried to complain and i was told i have no right to complain as i have access to the internet the girl said she would raise the complaint and then close it down and that i have no right for short if you are considering using virgin media for broadband think again they are the most expensive promising speedy broadband but they dont deliver and say use them youll regret it,Bad
565,hi gm im really sorry to hear about the issues you have had please get in touch to allow us to help you can find our contact options here,Bad

567,absolutely appalling has disgusting customer care and loyalty disrespectful indeed i am now leaving virgin media and am making complaints elsewhere as the complaint system of virgin media is not fit for purposes to date i have five outstanding complaints and these complaints could have been dealt with easily they have cancelled one complaint without my knowledge or consent i am never going back to virgin media and will be contacting tv trading programmes and members of parliament to expose virgin media to put an end to their disgraceful behaviour you ask what went wrong i am coming to the end of the contact yet give them the change to give me a cheaper price or the same price im paying for my broadband i have been a loyal customer they failed within this contract they boosted the wifi speeds but they want me to pay more now even though i did not ask for faster speeds now they want and not the i was supposed to be paying although i was only suppose to pay throughout my contract they were taking off me i called them today and have cancelled my contract i am appalled and feel disgusted with them so much for customer loyalty eh lastly although you pay in advance they want a final payment of from me but said they would reimburse that payment so they want me to pay something i do not owe although they were told i am on half pay at the moment due to maternity leave its money i have not got virgin media did get back in touch and offered as follow m broadband and weekend chatter for per month with a recurring credit of until the new contract ends so that the package price will for months goodwill gesture for the price increase we can offer you a one off credit of i did agree to the above the same day of their offer via this agreement to same email address but had no reply i telephoned virgin media to see what was going on and as it was days later they told me that the offer was no longer valid as it was several days later virgin media are pathetic and shameful virgin media resolution and complaint team has not helped a little bit virgin media staff is not fit for purposes in dealing with customers who feel the way i do its so very wrong and this is their thanks eh,Bad
568,the broadband is awesome fast and reliable but the customer services suck no way to skip the machine asking for a password it goes on and only to tell me at the end they are closed sunday also if they answer the wait in the phone is toooo long they need better web site for one to customise the package all this time of listening their stupid music while waiting for them to pick up,Bad
569,rang ee to discuss my options as i am coming to the end of my contract the deals offered didnt compare to the offered by other livechat person i spoke to went on to run down the company i am considering joining not very professional she did try to emphasise the good service ee offers and this is what they are worth the extra cost and i should text and the team would contact me i have tried on several occasions to do this but keep getting a message to say this cant be processed at this in summary high prices and poor service not a good experience,Bad
570,appalling company expensive internet slow and constantly down tivo box rubbish and very much s technology customer services is just automated and like visiting hell on a regular basis feel like weeping as stuck in a contract i didnt sign with them its so bad every time i see that richard branson on television i have to change channels,Bad
571,think they should rebrand as u useless or maybe p pointless either wud be more accurate and honest after trying to switch from talk talk recommended by them still no further forwards despite getting account number o sim written contract with incorrect mobile incorrect surname spelling number after days and hours spent on phone attempting to get things right contradictory messages will be live in hours sorry we cant do this for days still dont where i stand i half live in spain and realised this company is subsidiary of telefonica as they are monopolistic in spain realise why theyre as hopeless in uk avoid them at all costs so they will rightly fail in uk,Bad
572,talktalk have been the worst company i have ever had to deal with for about a month after i joined everything was hunky and then problems be honest half of the time the problem is not actually related to talktalk so im not blaming them for that however they have the worst most horrible to deal with customer service ever known to mankind you ring up and have to deal with someone who doesnt understand a word of english and your on hold for half the week until you get onto someone else who has no clue about why your calling talktalk i will be sharp in leaving you the very second my contract is up,Bad
573,very unstable doesnt provide minimum promised speed most of the time i was much happier with with a much slower speed promise broadband provider with a very stable broadband service from bt or could be their wifi router but even with extender which i had to spend extra its unstable i dont notice x speed improvement either that i should be has impacted my home working and kids waiting for my contract to get over and switch to even a slower but stable service provider,Bad
574,absolute there are no faults no nightmare to book an nov after their response i am more convinced that this talktalk company is going down the cant afford to have a human being answering and unable to send an top of that they even cancelled the message about the go feeling is that soon this company will be in november i have paid my final they charged me for early termination of contract i will request a refund for breach of contract unable to provide a service refusing to send an engineer to fix the when i changed to bt the fault was confirmed to be the up by an upsurge of voltage they cowardly cancelled the text message sent on my mobile confirming the engineer appointment date,Bad
575,i left bt years ago because of their appalling customer services all i wanted to do was buy a new line into the house so my teenage son had his own phone and have my office line moved from the house to a home office i had built in the garden however this proved just too difficult for them to do well that was the conclusion i came to after months of trying there comes a time when even if you wish to stay with a company their appalling behaviour and lack of courtesy is too much quite frankly the worst company i have ever had to do business with,Bad
576,its a pretty reliable service but i dont get wifi in my kitchen which is not very far away from the router hub bed terraced house and it appears the only way to solve this is to pay virgin a monthly fee for a mesh pod which makes the monthly cost way too expensive in my opinion we pay for the gb service already which apparently doesnt cover free pods even though it was the second best service available when we signed tried our own wifi extender but that was with the virgin hub we have and just made everything more annoying going from network to network when leaving the kitchen plus the virgin hub lost the extra setting when they did work locally so we had to add it again annoying and not a problem we ever had with sky our previous virgin do work locally i have to reset my devices and the router forgets its settings when i do the restart procedure they suggest this is ok once in a while i guess but so far its been at least three times and we are brand new no i wouldnt recommend virgin and i will most likely look for a different giving it one star because it is quite fast but thats it,Bad
577,really regret leaving sky have yet to see compensation due to me stuck with these cowboys until october next year as well please dont go with virgin is my advice to anyone thinking about it,Bad
578,i was with ee a few years ago i got tricked into a contract and then they reminded me one month the bill was due second month no reminder and they cut me off demanding i pay extra to get connected again plus having to pay to get help with ur provider how have they been the best for years it must be fixed in some way as i dont believe they have been by being honest as they r not honest hence y i left them they charge for a paper bill that cost what p for the paper and they dont have to pay for a stamp there all about money making there not there for people if they were when i said no odd times to a contract they would have left it but they didnt they kept on till i felt bullied to do it,Bad
579,bad service bad costumer service,Bad
580,sorry i am here again and whilst talk talk blaming microsoft for my difficulties it seems the absolute actually had a chat to a very nice girl who was absolutely useless and after an hour of pressing everything she gave me a long link no which ended in community chat which is where i was three weeks wishing to upset i politely went off the phone and growled if this wasnt so frustrating it could be funny with a victoria wood sheer agony and we cant blame for everything as things were the same with tech companies before so my catharsis is to rant here and really will it do any good so many people agree with me we have just become an army of likewise growlers going in the garden to sniff the air and flowers and calm down,Bad
581,vodafone pay lip service to complaints they are extraordinarily polite and think that that makes up for being totally useless their billing system is horrendous doesnt matter how much you pay them you always owe them something their website tells you nothing and head office just seems to deny all knowledge i highly recommend that you dont use them,Bad
582,this is my third talk talk review and i hate the fact i even have to give them star they dont deserve even this is the third review i have written about talk talk and i will continue to until they finally have cancelled my service and after the first review was on after months of trying to leave and sending letters to their office i was still paying for there terrible service that has never even come close to speeds promised after this i did receive a reply ha e thing but missed their hour deadline but was told to contact them through social media which i did again recounting there awful service and the fact ive been trying to leave for months through phone calls and letters all either ignored or calls cut off while going to a another department again they asked what i wanted to do i said leave asap stop stealing my money for your awful service told to send my reference number and phone number someone will be in contact no one contacted me after chasing them for another month and leaving another review which this time they didnt even bother to answer this time went back to social media same same answer as always please send your ref number and phone number someone will be in contact again wait a couple of days no one contacts again contact them what would you like to leave we dont deal with that here what is your reference number and phone number again give it them someone will discuss i dont want to discuss it i want to leave not that anyone ever calls any these reviews just stop one other person using your service i will be glad you are the worst company in the world your service is awful your customer service is awful you are literally stealing monet from me i have now cancelled my direct debit because i dont want to pay u another penny talktalk and anyone who works for them is an embarrassment and i dont know how they can get away with this there are hundreds maybe thousands of reviews on this page saying the same thing your a disgrace if one thing all these star reviews just show how how low you are willing to stoop to keep the few remaining customers you dont normally fo full karen rant but but this is what you lead people to,Bad
583,we have been on for some years now but the recent experience has been terrible we have been offline now for days every time we have rung we have been told it is a complex problem they are trying to resolve we were then told it would be fixed by a day ago when it wasnt fixed we rang again and were told it was never set to return by then but would be fixed by the evening in three days time when we asked about compensation they told us there would be no compensation as they had flagged it as an intermittent fault we told them we had restarted the router every two hours and had never received a signal they said sorry but still did not agree to any compensation we had signed up for their email announcements but have never received any emails or information about the outage we have had to go to a neighbours for a signal even though we have to shield truly abysmally awful you look at the reply from below youll see a phone number ring hahahaha no such number exists,Bad
584,o overcharged me youd think it would be simple for them to rectify weeks later and still no refund endless promises that the refund has been processed lies requested copies of chat we will email them to you within hours when they didnt arrive i was given a link to request it at a charge advised that if i wanted to speak to a customer service manager i would have to call recorded message said wait time was approx minutes minutes of listening to white noise that could be classed as torture last time i take a contract with o customer service is the bottom of their priority list wonder what would happen if i cancel my direct debit,Bad
585,when we moved house and saw the speeds of the internet virgin had to offer we was very excited to go with virgin internet how wrong we was the internet is probably the worst we have ever had none stop buffering always having to reset the router places in the house that wifi doesnt reach and i was told we wouldnt have that issue with the package i went with nothing but disappointed with virgin wifi and cannot wait for my contract to be over so i can leave and join someone else definitely wouldnt recommend virgin wifi,Bad
586,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
587,following on from my previous star review which should really be no stars i reached out to you via facebook and sent screenshots of the issue which now remains unresolved for over months unfortunately you have been no help whatsoever and are just repeating the steps i have gone through multiple times before,Bad

590,the multimillion company should at least provide good customer service if they cant provide service as they say very disappointing service from online chat group i thought they were there to provide service very disappoint that they disconnected my chat while i was chatting,Bad
591,disaster trying to contact customer service few days before my contract ended they just kept passing me on to another call handler after nearly two hours they said they would end contract and customer service will return a call to enquire why cancelling person who called could hardly speak english informed i just wish to end contract and nothing more they started asking security questions which i refused to give as i felt was being spam now theyve sent a new bill shocking customer service never clear,Bad
592,following on from my last review of bt after which i received a very welcome refund i looked at my account today only to find id been overcharged by some on my june bill after minutes on hold and i was told that i would receive a refund for this i asked what proof i could have of this conversation as the chances were high that id have to chase this up again in the future and eventually a complaint was raised on my behalf but i swear this would not have if i hadnt pressed my point come on bt give us some respect you treat us as customers extremely poorly and your only saving grace are the decent people working for you on the phones who have to cover for your corporate ineptitude a shocking state of affairs as usual,Bad
593,been with vodafone years but on two occasions in last years they have attempted me contracts i did not want and declined but was still placed on the newer more expensive i have then had to request reversion to the previous tariffs on so many occasions until you threaten them with a very public complain they obstruct you in the hopes that eventually you give up and remain on the higher tariff i am leaving them devious business practices and now the signal is so poor in my area you could not call it a service avoid expensive and useless,Bad
594,security questions are like those used by a scammer very to technical by the multiple security questions received a single response to one question and then no response to anything else still not sure if my problem faulty equipment supplied for new contract is being addressed tried phone number auto response said it would test the line for a router that was not connected then texted a message saying they needed assistance to deal with the problem texting reach a brick wall and still no way to explain the problem so so so disappointed with this service if i hadnt just started a new contract i would seriously consider leaving after over years with you as a service provider,Bad
595,very bad service n all the time take extra n extra money my bill is but they take n n more i cancelled my direct debit i got so much angry,Bad
596,chose virgin when we moved to london months ago now that our new customer offer has expired the price has more than doubled more importantly though the quality of our broadband is pretty poor i have had to work from home because of and it is a nightmare i have now switched to g with my mobile provider easy to install faster double the speed and better very stable connection quality and cheaper less than a third of the price cancelling my contract to virgin was also a very poor experience i spent minutes on the phone had to explain to two different persons that no matter what i could not be convinced to remain a virgin customer they did not listen and kept pushing to convince me to stay with their company hard sale is never a good approach such poor customer service i am very happy with my g broadband and would recommend anyone who is not satisfied with virgin to inquire about g,Bad
597,steer well clear of this awful company we have had major problems with a refurbished phone that died shortly after the day warranty period my daughter bought it as her first ever phone having saved for a year as we were out of warranty and because i wanted some control over the outcome given my daughters investment i took it to an independent repair shop however after a replacement battery it became clear that there was a more fundamental problem diagnosed by the engineer as an ic power management issue he advised returning it to as wed only had the phone for months at this point claimed id actually had a month warranty though there is nothing in the documentation to confirm this and could have returned it for a full refund or repair of course id invalidated this as id used an independent engineer they then diagnosed something that contradicted our engineers report and which is physically impossible according to him given the tests he was able to run and surprise surprise their fault also invalidated the warranty regardless of how long it was so no real options then laughable thing is that the repair cost quoted by referred to as good news in their email was way more expensive than the cost of simply buying another very good condition refurbished phone from them why would anyone bother doing that it strikes me that customers are caught in a catch theres no way of proving that the damage to the phone is what you think it is without invalidating the warranty they then quote a stupidly high fee to repair so that the only option is to buy a new phone i wonder how many people are caught out by this and unlike me dont have the energy or persistence to pursue it through every channel to say i wont be getting the phone repaired by them ive also cancelled all our family goody bags and have shared this sorry tale with family and friends alike whats frustrating is that if theyd sorted the problem out and sent a replacement phone id have been singing their praises to everyone rather than writing the most blistering report i can on here what a waste of everyones dont bother with them,Bad
598,i have had talk talk for a few weeks now and would not advice anyone to go with them i also have family members with this company and they are absolutely rubbish internet crashes all the time can never get a decent signal i really just think this network should shut down because it is complete and utter crap,Bad
599,worst company ever i had a year pay monthly account one year ago i was mistakenly overcharged pounds which i am still waiting to be credited to my account i have spent hours on the chat service all the agents are very kind but ultimately nobody has been able to solve my request i have been confirmed several times that this wrong overcharge will be credited back to my account but for one reason or the other there is always a problem when i noticed the company that after my two year contract i was not renewing the service i was offered all kind of apologies and offers but there is no way i am ever going to deal with this company again,Bad
600,i wont bother going into details but to say if you value your sanity then avoid this criminal organisation,Bad

602,i moved months ago virgin media was unable to supply me with contacted customer service several times and they confirmed that they had issued the is not true it never always called the customer service and they kept telling me that they had sent it to the old house this is not true because i bought the service of directing the letters in the new housethe worst thing and the very bad experience is that i have not received the proper assistance untrained staff and i am still waiting for my also have a reference communication hm where they confirm that i am eligible for the refund im tired of these scams and above all of a nonexistent i called again and they were not able to help,Bad

609,avoid if i could rate it i would had our activation day on the th of december and i am still here with no in an engineer visit for the th nobody showed up called in to book another one and they forgot to actually book in the appointment we were supposed to have another engineer visit today on the th and the engineer did not show up again when i called in they could not explain the situation worst customer service i have ever seen in my life agents replying in a rude manner raising their voices at compensation for missed time of work or extra mobile data been here with no internet for almost anybody who is thinking of switching to avoid avoid,Bad

622,have been paying for an unlimited sim card since january still not received it have spent nearly hours on the phone to the overseas call centre and still no joy have been a customer since,Bad
623,account number hi i was a vodafone customer for nearly years until two weeks ago when i moved to a different provider as i couldnt take it anymore i had no contracts at the moment one for me one for my wife and a tablet i have never missed a payment bill ever on september we moved to st albans and straight away we noticed that within the house area the signal was so bad line that we couldnt receive or make calls sometime then same issue at work in centre of london also was in the middle of this pandemic and sometime i worked from home and i couldnt do my job answering emails and calls because no signal i always thought the issue is the phone i reported that to vodafone several times and the answer was always the same works are undertaken within the area and in days signal should come back to normal weeks past the issue was there and the answer to my complaints were the same most of the conversations with vodafone were by them calling me at some point one of their people was begging me to close the complaint just a few emails i record of and i will upload as evidence but mostly everything was verbal phone conversations after a very long period of time and having me going through this issues for so long vodafone offered me refund and free special discounted upgrade for two new phones and i said yes they probably used my yes and closed the complaint straight away next i went on their app to start looking to upgrade to discover that the special discounted upgrade option they offered wasnt special at all i meant it was an offer that anybody any new customer that wanted to join vodafone could get its what was available on their website i went back to vodafone and i said that complaint is not closed yet as they lied to me offering a special discounted upgrade which wasnt they ignored my calls and everything i also contacted and the fact that i said yes and the complaint was closed under rule they had to uphold the objection for three times months since the issue and my complaint i still had contracts and no signal on one of them this is unbelievable and hard to understand why they doing things like this scam bags and vodafone are working together to scam people,Bad
624,virgin customer service can be fine but at least half the time it is a go though tonnes of repetitive options to get the bot to say theyll transfer you to a human then it flashed up another load of options that youve already been through and asks whether you are now satisfied or want to hold obviously you choose to hold then it does that again nine times then it makes you wait minutes before starting that again its clearly just been set up to pretend theres any availability for customer service and anger people into just giving up my reason for contact is that theyre giving me download speeds far lower than my minimum guaranteed speed should be a simple fix but instead i just go through this farce whenever i can bring myself to response to the response below claiming to have avenues to customer service that dont get a customer anywhere is a really great way to highlight the failings i mentioned im still in the same position just via text now rather than online chat thanks for making it even clearer,Bad
625,i keep receiving generic responses that have been with no aim to look into the actual problem,Bad
626,got the new talk talk fibre broad band fitted today promising us a speed of up to and all over the house and even in the garden super fast speed internet what an absolute waste of time we are getting a speed of if we are lucky and no connection to the internet at all in any room apart from our living room wish we havent of left virgin media for this rubbish we will definitely be getting it taken out and returning to virgin media would not recommend at all,Bad
627,i wanted to know why changes to my contract had occurred and when did my current contract end simple question after answering security question i was given a link to open my account which i had already opened i have notice my bills are steadily rising and dont recall any notifications of the charges,Bad
628,unbelievably rude rang to cancel in january after months of lousy broadband wasnt told i had to give days notice plus the cancellation wasnt put through properly even though i rang back to check they then tried to take from my account and when i rang them the agent used phrases like give you the benefit of the doubt even though it was recorded on their system that id called to cancel when i said i had have spent hours trying to sort out their errors but apparently they dont offer goodwill gestures and from the attitude ive had they couldnt care less about their customer service or reputation either,Bad
629,tried to cancel my brothers contract that i pay for he is ill and cant make it to a shop to do it himself what a complete night mare not helpful people i was able to describe the account and all the information on the account and the fact that it had not been accessed for months but was told that i could have been making it up what a joke kelly who i spoke with in newcastle was a nightmare my brother had previously tried to cancel over the phone but as i paid for it he didnt know the banking detail and so was told he failed the security test i have called a couple of time now to try and sort it out and was told that my terminally ill brother needs to attend a shop to get his credentials checked what a nightmare i asked to speak with a manager or supervisor and was told i couldnt also the lady i spoke with wouldnt provide me with an email address to complain to not happy to say the least feel as though im just being ripped off,Bad
630,i said at the beginning that i was and believe that fact was have kept up with technology quite well for my age but your chat people seem to treat everyone the same and go through the same hoops with them when someone of my age asks for an engineers visit and is happy to pay for it you should accept it and not keep asking the same questions i tried last week to get a visit and all i got was an email telling me you had done a health check and there was nothing wrong and since my box has been disconnected for about a month now there definitely is something wrong,Bad
631,absolute scam company do not know where the good reviews are from i assume they must be ai the fraudsters within the company put sim in phone try to use the smart pin system repeatedly just comes back with a message saying connection problem or invalid mmi code call turns out theres no way to speak to an actual human and its just a neverending loop of dial for top up etc no matter what you choose there is no way to speak to a human since then whenever i try to do anything it just keeps saying mobile network not available i cannot call i cannot text i cannot get on the internet i cant even use the smart pin system or call the pointless number went on live chat and spoke to waste of space kim her wise advice was to try again in hours so i am to just not do anything on my phone for hours and then try again using the smart pin system which is not smart and does not work i asked her to cancel my account and she just left the chat do not use this company they are response to the reply below i have tried several times emailing both the email address listed there the and also and it is clear no one is manning these email addresses i have also been on hold for over an hour several times to the customer service number it is clear the email addresses and also the phone number are all fakes i have been trying to get my pac number for days so i can leave and they are refusing to give it to me i will be reporting to ofcom,Bad
632,terrible customer service more than once i have been promised compensation for multiple failings but when it is not paid and i call up they have no record of compensate being last time i asked to record the conversation and they said they would not be recorded and hung up on mei have written to formal complaints and both have been completely am currently taking it to the ombudsman,Bad
633,before renewal they refused to give me my current tariff instead they offered me a more expensive package promising a better speed etc but in fact they lied they only give me the rubbish that i was already using and only raised the representatives are after spending hours on the phone to trouble shoot weak signal promises given to me but lie after lie i still have the problem with wifi signal,Bad
634,without any shadow of a doubt the worst customer service i have experienced in my life all due to the fact the router is an absolutely appalling piece of hardware as admitted by their own technical managers and engineers who are completely powerless to resolve the situation trying to extricate ones self from a contract that provides no service wasted two months of my response to your message below emma the sentiment is nice but its essentially empty as i said your team is powerless to resolve the situation as your router hardware is so poor you sent me the same piece of times over somehow expecting different results when the router is unable to broadcast wifi outwith the room,Bad
635,utter shambles of a company went with them as they offered the fastest speeds at the time this was years ago everything went well then broadband stopped working contacted them and eventually an engineer was sent out and fixed the problem happy days until weeks ago broadband stopped working so i filed a report online as you do got a fault number etc then tracked the fault report as you do no contact at all from bt not even a fault report acknowledgement tried calling but gave up after mins on hold days later they claim the fault is fixed yet the red broadband fault light is still merrily winking away at another fault report and again no response track the fault again and says it will be fixed on may rd at pm this time comes and goes with no from bt send an email threatening to leave and miracle of miracles receive an email saying they are looking into it coincidence some guy with a foreign sounding name says he is aware of the problem and needs to speak to me about it no sherlock thats what ive been trying to do claims he has been trying to call me no calls received or missed says he will call between and pm doesnt send another email saying i am leaving he replies saying he tried phoning lies i took time off work and my phone never rang once i say try texting or email no reply in short avoid like the plague worst customer just google bt customer,Bad
636,useless company asking customers to keep paying out to improve a dire service how many boosters do you need broadband unreliable repeatedly tv not worth having i would have stuck with sky great customer service but the broadband wasnt good in my area,Bad
637,what a joke of a company been trying to port number over for days still they havent managed to do a simple thing call customer service everyday get told same thing everytime it been escalated,Bad
638,absolutely appalling customer service the customer service passive aggressively directs you to the website and hangs up for every single chat doesnt work on most browsers when you do get connected to someone on live chat they insist you stay on and message them every minutes as to not get disconnected this often leads to no resolution at managed to lose my broadband account which was registered with my vodafone mobile number i got in touch with them wanting to know how to view my account and pay my bill my order apparently was incomplete even though the service was live yet after raising this issue with them i now have no broadband service huh great,Bad
639,talktalk have been really poor i have had no service for a month and they have not bothered getting back to me or repairing the fault i have had no service yet they took my money,Bad
640,against the advice of family and friends who had also had issues with virgin media i made the mistake of joining i started with a broadband only package and shortly after upgraded to tv and phone to save money after installation i received a new contract which contained a cancellation form i decided to revert to my broadband only package so completed the form which gave me days to change my mind and sent it to virgin media recorded delivery it was delivered and signed for two weeks later my broadband was deactivated and my account suspended for non payment on i queried this and was told it was the upfront costs for broadband tv and phone i advised i had cancelled the tv and phone and should just have broadband to cut a long story short virgin told me i did not return the cancellation form and was stuck with the full package i have written to them refusing to pay and am waiting a response from them i will update accordingly,Bad
641,booked an install of broadband for today confirmed by email day off work booked and no one arrived called and advised they cant install broadband at my address not advised at all and now lost time off work,Bad
642,i originally ordered my virgin broadband on the th october today is the th january and it has still not been installed ive had cancellations in these months ive not had one virgin employee visit my house ive had one external company to install a wire which there was a blockage so they left within minutes that was a month and a half ago their customer service is just shocking when you eventually get through to speak to someone you are just told what you want to hear and nothing more i logged a complaint early december only to find out no one actually logged it logged another complaint after my th cancellation and was told the complaints department would contact me within days weeks later and ive heard nothing my next installation date is the st january which im fully expecting to be cancelled if it is i will be cancelling me and my girlfriend both work remotely its costing us a fortune in phone data extensions and i guarantee virgin wont do anything to compensate us if virgin wasnt the fastest speed in my area i would have jumped ship months ago use virgin as a last resort,Bad
643,the most useless dysfunctional organisation on the planet ive just been told by a member of the virgin media executive team the escalation procedure is to go back to the philippines help desk and repeat all of the same the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results this is what vm expect you to do,Bad

645,they didnt cancel my contract and kept charging me for more months when called they just said that they see that ive been referred to another agent but they dont see the outcome on their system it might be a technical issue issue which i had to pay for absolutely ridiculous company already filling for small claims court these scams need to stop being with them for more than years but its time to move on,Bad

648,virgin media have some of the poorest service of any provider the internet cuts out unexpectedly for hours at a time and when you complain nobody gets back to you all you get is a canned letter saying sorry before i took the service out my brother said to me that virgin medias service is the worst he has ever experienced i didnt listen to him but experienced everything first my contract comes to an end i will leave and never ever come back to them not even if they give me a service for free complete and utter joke of a company,Bad

727,where do i start ive been done over by ee in the past but was stupid enough to go with them again my contract is meant to be a month which would have been fine however a few months into my contract my phone bills started creeping up until they reached a ridiculous each month with some even going as high as i only noticed this because of my bank statements as conveniently ee wont send you out a paper bill unless you pay a month for the privilege the app to check your usage is about as much use as a chocolate ash tray so decided to go into my local ee store to speak with someone face to face about my astronomical bills i was told that it looked as though my bills were sky high due to over use of data so for the next few months i practically stopped using my phone to see if this made any difference after a few months my bills were still in the region of so i went back to the store explained to a different person the situation their suggestion was of course to take even more money from me by asking if i wanted to pay more for additional gb of data each month which i reluctantly did months on from this my bills were still to a month which i was struggling to pay i again went into the ee store to kick up some stink about the dilemma i was told it would be best to contact customer services to discuss the problem upon calling i found what was really causing the ridiculous bills it was infact third party companies which had been taking between to a month from me with ee failing to notice this on their system i was furious spend literally hours on the phone to ee in the evenings getting all of the third party companies details so i could get in touch to cancel them so not only did ee fail to pick this up but also persuaded me to purchase more monthly data as they made out that it was my fault for the high bills the real joke started when i started trying to complain to ee the foreign woman i spoke with on the phone was very reluctant to give me any details for creating a complaint her exact words to begin with were we dont actually have a complaints address as we have never had a complaint after id picked myself off the floor from laughing i pushed harder for an address when she then rattled off an email address i told her no i wanted an actual address to write send a letter recorded delivery after minutes on hold i eventually got one however since its my word against the ee members of staff in the store it would more than likely be a waste of a stamp sending a letter of complaint completely frustrating being treated in such a disgusting manner no one to help you if they spent less money on ridiculous kevin bacon adverts and more on customer services staff training they might have a some decent reviews on here no complaints she told me she obviously hasnt looked online yet,Bad

732,the signal around my home and work area is awful you repeatedly get told that its ok as you can use wifi calling what is the point of having a mobile phone if you have to be tied to wifi to use it when you are on hold you are bombarded with wifi calling messages is the ee network signal has been getting worse over the last months and is completely useless in the town centre as one of the masts is down ee have provided regular updates to say it is fixed and then the next day another update appears to say there is a problem in your area if ee cannot provide the service ee should let customers out of their contract with no financial penalty i am sick and tired of having to call up every month to complain about this,Bad
733,i would give less than one star but that option is not available when switching to bt approx two years ago it did not get off to a good start the initial order had been cancelled due to no one knows numerous calls to get the service up and running then ongoing numerous billing irregularities and final this week we wanted to cancel all services apart from the landline we were out of contract but had never been given a notification that it was to the end and whose fault was that yes it was ours the customer oh well i guess they are right so we rang on tuesday to discuss and change to what we wanted all sorted how wrong could we be then we received a text the cancellation was cancelled we rang back and were told we would have to ring back the following morning wednesday this was due to blah blah blah anyway we duly rang back and went through the whole process again yes they would send a box for the return of the router etc yes another text rang them back and told to ring back this morning thurs we went through the whole process again and yes text received again we rang back at pm not best pleased due to the way the orders were placed we would have to ring back on monday coming then having spoke to a supervisor he explained that the three previous call takers had made mistakes i explained that we were being put to a great deal of inconvenience and what assurances did i have that monday would simply not be a repeat of this are absolutely incompetent use anyone else but them the supervisor took my complaint but said he could do nothing to help uswe have received a reply but we have lost the will to live trying to get in touch with some faceless person via various twitter and support sites is frustrating we stand by our original complaint we have spoken direct with service four times and they are useless why does a senior manager not get involved because someone is paying their wages and i certainly would not how hard can this be,Bad

736,switched to bt to take advantage of fibre and tv sport channels having sold me the fibre they then could not deliver as no capacity at local box initially they left me with no working phone line having contended with the overseas call centres to the point of frustration and raising blood pressure they eventually sent an engineer to restore the phone line however he left me without any broadband provision and tv and this continued for many complained i was subsequently lied to about when and how my service would be remedied to the point where i switched away from bt as i realised what a bunch of complete they are watching the glossy ads on the tv made me quite nauseous but also reinforced the lesson of not believing pr switch to bt was in november i switched away from them in december now the following march soon to be april i am still awaiting a final stopped answering my emails until i invoked that wonderful phrase communications ombudsman go figure i wish i could figure out how to award zero stars,Bad

749,we are a small family run business to which bt forced us into buying feature lines for our business telephones over years ago as well as forcing us to purchase the whole phone system outright we were originally moving our premises some or so years ago at the time the bt business team sent out a representative who informed us that we required feature lines at an outrageous cost per month he also told us that we could not lease the phone system but had to purchase it outright with all the extras in order to make the system work bt quantum vat the switch over took a lot longer than quoted and we were also told that we had to have another telephone number on top of our previous number and extra telephone number required to run the phone system in total telephone numbers during our first years appx bills were incorrect and we had to keep chasing to have them corrected and were forced to pay and were told the amount would be credited to our account over the following months this was indeed done but they way in which it was done was such that the full amount was never credited back despite numerous calls to bt to lodge complaints and to sort the issue out including submitted our call recordings of all communication they had never fulfilled this and sent call recordings that were just static funny how a telephone company who states that they record telephone calls couldnt provide this none the less we continued to honour our contract even though we were not being provided the service we had paid for we were told that if we terminated our contract we would be penalised as it was nothing to do with brings the final nail to the coffin as it were that bt had issued a bill in september that had not been received and the october bill was the october bill was paid in good time and i received a call from bt to say that they would disconnect our service because of an unpaid bill when i disputed this they apologised and said they would send the bill out today over days since that call i still have not received it and was told to go online and download it myself thus doing their job for them they had disconnected our service without warning or even an opportunity to pay said bill when i had called bt to register the complaint they said that any sales more than a year old cannot have any issues rectified they said well what would you like me to do disgusting behaviour bt think that this issue will go away however i can assure them it will not they still have not met my request for our data held on file nor do they want to accept the opportunity to rectify the issue i have given them several opportunities now for their customer service team to contact me to run through all that has happened during our contract and even outside of the contract yet they just hang up the phone what ever you do avoid bt at all costs they are not the only telecoms provider we now use glide who provide an outstanding level of service and incredibly competitive rates i would personally pay a conman to deal with our telecoms over bt as they have more integrity and would more than likely give better customer scoundrels con artists and are what i would describe bt as i invite any senior member of the bt management team to contact me to discuss this,Bad

806,very disappointed with talktalk no issues with the internet quality during my time with them however the issues started after leaving the provider talktalk sent totally confusing emails with different final bill amounts on i paid the most recent one assuming it was correct however i then received a subsequent bill which was a late payment charge unfortunately i was late paying this as i was in the process of moving house and also found out that a family member has cancer at the same time so understandably this was not high on the list of my priorities the next i heard regarding the matter was that it had been referred to a debt collection agency who had doubled the price however talktalk had failed to notify me at all that this was the next course of action after a fraught phone call where everyone blamed each other talktalk were adamant they had notified me of this they had not at any point i paid the remaining balance in full to avoid any further action that would have lasting effects on my credit file i then contacted the debt collection agency and explained that the matter was settled however they then tried to take payment from me which i refused and asked to speak to a manager eventually whom agreed i did not nee to make any further payments and the matter was now resolved i am in the process of making a formal complaint to talktalk as i am not happy with the way the matter has been handled regrettably i am stuck with talktalk in my new property but i will be leaving this dreadful company as soon as my contract is over and would not recommend them to my worst enemy they need a serious overhaul of their systems processes and communications when leaving and need to accept some responsibility for their failure to communicate correctly and the repercussions it may have on peoples credit reports when defaults are recorded,Bad
807,one star is been generous in my eyes first off all god knows how they manage to land that airplane on the advert with this network they can land a but i have to throw me hands all over when am trying to have a st just to get a signal anyone who says this network is brilliant is smoking crack and im pretty sure kevin bacon must of been on whizz to advertise for these ive spoke to several agents about the signal and one says its my phone one says its the masts in my area one said the network was having technical issues so i dont know which pot smoking hippy im supposed to believe feel like biting me hands off in pure frustration this will be the last time i ever go to ee ive tried this network times now and each time ive had different problems id rather st in my hands and clap than get another contract with these land a jet on ee my ae if that jet was anything like my signal itll be buffering mid air good luck passengers,Bad
808,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
809,stay away from this a joke thieves disgusting company after a month of their service i came to an agreement with their complaints team that i would pay that i have used and they would cancel our contract because the service was so poor they advised they would call me back to take the payment months later they hadnt called but gladly started to send me bills for once speaking to their complaints team they agreed to look into this they didnt and continue to send bills for threatening court action these are liars and stay away from this company at all costs,Bad
810,recently talktalk has treated its small business customers with total disrespect shifting the service to talktalk residential who can not cope with business customers without my permission communications have been misleading at best bordering on plain lies customer services in the past month has been appalling with no one wanting to take any responsibility to resolve even simple issues such as my caller display is no longer working as an example i was told the talktalk customer service person could not help me because my line is ceased despite that fact i was calling form that line and another customer service person could not resolve my lack of caller display because thats a network issue but then refused to give me a number or pass me on to someone who could restore my caller display service i asked to speak to a manger and was passed onto a junior colleague but told she was a manager i have started to move my business account to another operator and as soon as that is done i shall move my home line too i will also no longer recommend talktalk to other businesses or to my friends as i have done for many years put simply attitude to small businesses and appalling customer service has driven me away and put me to a lot of inconvenience i strongly recommend not using this company remember you have to phone up to request a refund after you move your service to another provider otherwise talktalk will not refund what they owe you you have to wait a month before you can phone up to request the refund in my case it took me four months of hassling to get my refund after they first tried sending me a cheque made out to a person and i had to wait another month for them to consider reissuing the cheque i returned in the proper name,Bad
811,the most worst provider i will never go with talk talk avoid avoid avoid,Bad
812,absolutely horrible company christine from complain department should never been allowed to deal with customers for years theyve been calling me and asking whether i want to update my contact then one day theyve sent sneaky email to inform tha contact expired they then increased my fees by without ringing me as theyve been doing this over the past years i fought hard trying to get extra charges back but they believe that they did nothing wrong avoid this at any cost,Bad
813,asked why virgin media customers could leave but loyal o customers could not no response i now pay pm for mb new customers just extraordinary then to read their new promo nobody likes feeling as though theyre being shortchanged especially in a cost of living crisis,Bad

820,if there were zero stars id give this to vodafone but i have to give star on moved a broadband service away from vodafone for a company i work for on a voluntary basis vodafone now claims the contract hadnt passed its minimum term which they claim was months despite there being no contract available by email when the account want opened or online on their billing portal to confirm this i agreed with them i entered into the contract on the telephone but now they claim they cant provide evidence of this if the contract was entered into over months the not for profit company this is for run by volunteers on a charitable basis has to pay the termination charge for a contract which vodafone claims exists but is unwilling to provide evidence of apparently i can request a copy of their terms and conditions which i have done but they wont provide me of any evidence of the original contract length vodafone tells me this isnt available once a contract has been cancelled very also refuses to provide a deadlock letter for me to take this to the service so i must wait until weeks are up from when they registered my complaint so i can then go to the ombudsman service customer service is nonexistent and truly shocking thats the reason for moving away from vodafone not to save termination fee isnt huge in this case its about but thats money which a not for profit charitable company needs to safeguard so i have to take this matter dont ever use vodafone i regret that i vodafone entered the response below however this was not a home contract it was a business contract and they were not all months there were shorter business contracts in existence so the reply from vodafone is not id already tried to engage with vodafone via social media as vodafone suggests this got nowhere dont use vodafone i went there because of price which was a horrible mistake price and value for money arent the same thing,Bad

832,only another truly terrible review to be added im afraid since day one we had intermittent service with the latest hub every day it would drop out numerous times when chasing this up with the faults team we were sent around the houses checking all of the basics then eventually getting engineers out they had no understanding of the word intermittent so would show up typically it would be working for the mins they were here shrug their shoulders and leave this didnt stop happening and after an unreal amount of phone calls being told the same thing we can send out an engineer we eventually went to the cancellation department spoke to a guy called steve in the sheffield office who said yes we can cancel because of the consistent issues weve had go and sort out another provider and call back which we did only to speak to caroline in the same department a day later who then refused to cancel the contract without incurring hefty charges contradicting her colleague the only other option was to speak to a so called broadband specialist who was actually much more helpful he told us we werent going mad there was a big network issue in the area central london btw and that we were receiving terrible service this was music to our ears finally someone was listening so he filed a job ticket for the guys to do some work in the area and said we would have updates until it was solved and it would be solved weeks pass nothing no improvement actually the service got worse so here we go again calling for news having to go over and over the same issue with fault team telling us to reset our box etc they dont understand that we spoke to someone who has better insight than themselves they just have to tick the sheet on their screens we spoke to various customer relations teams just saying we want out look at our history of calls look at the issues generally speaking each and every time we spoke to these people they were highly aggressive incredibly rude and infuriating after our many months of calm patience the guy we got routed to in america yesterday was literally the most person we were yet to speak to his attitude was actually making us laugh in bewilderment anyway we got out the angry american dude finally buckled and wanted rid of us i have never received such a bad service and will never again use virgin media seeing their laughable review score on this website says it all a total shambles of a company steer well clear and save yourself a lot of hassle,Bad

890,i have been trying to contact talktalk customer services this morning for about hours online chat was not available after i spent a lot of time to look for where to start called its hotline number the first call was terminated by its automatic answering machine telling me the bill payment team is not available to answering calls due to called from same number again was transferred directly to a voice msg called from another number again was told that there will be an email sent to me later then the line was cut so frustrating i was wondering when my refund will be received it was agreed back in january now lockdown has been lifted stop using as your excuse not to answer phone calls,Bad
891,originally had a contract with home telecom they couldnt provide a home move service in time for my home move including the demand for upfront payments for a home move i canceled my contract with them and moved over to a better provider after communications about repayments being ignored threats to go to court just weeks after me stopping the contract consent pressure and demand for the contract debts being paid after arranging a repayment plan with the credit control manager for the end of the months more pressured emails to make repayments even after i have paid my first installment and have all intention in paying the rest but another communication to our previous correspondence and failure to contact us regarding your outstanding balance of xxxx we are now in the process of sending your account to county court you have up to days from the date of this letter to prevent the above to respond to this notification will result in your outstanding balance being processed through the county court and you will be liable for all costs incurred please note that this action will affect your credit ratings which may have an impact on future tenancy agreements it will also affect your ability to obtain credit in the future as a default is recorded on your credit file for six even though i have made payment and i intend to pay the outstanding balance i have they are pressuring me to pay the full amount and ignoring my emails is this a trading standard issue,Bad

893,utter garbage service i have made a monumental mistake going back to these after over years away from them because of the abysmal customer service and inability to sort a problem out in an acceptable period of time it was over months before and items i was told to buy to get me over the situation were never reimbursed this time no internet connection for full month from my go live date no english speaking customer service with foreign agents who must be reading from a card and havent got a clue what you are trying to tell them the escalation managers are no better and go through the same routine you speak to people in this country when they want to sign you up and once that happens your in a world of hurt if you have any further problems as trying to speak to someone in this country after that is warned i am seriously going to fall out with the members of my family that persuaded me to give them a go again a joke is funny these people are not so calling them a joke would be very for the reply vicky but i dont want to talk to a community team i want some action from an english speaking customer service team that looking from previous reviews talktalk badly need to provide i am waiting for a call to sort compensation out for my ordeal i have also asked to be contacted by the cancellation team and all that is put back to me is it is down to me to close the case i am waiting for your lot to give me a call but they will not get cancellations to contact me i know a case can be escalated to the directors office and once it gets there the people who do very little about things are held very accountable for back heeling issues or not seeing them out to there conclusions which is being put back onto me unbelievable,Bad
894,been with talk talk for years when i noticed i was paying more than double the price on offer asked to change deal as my contract had long ended years ago repeatedly asked what the cheapest deal was they gave stupid answers and said i would need fast speed bb asked what my current deal speed was so i can compare the manager mary lyn said she couldnt tell me when i questioned how they could state i need to have faster package when they couldnt tell me my current package speed was they just cut me off all of this took over an hour avoid this provider,Bad

897,appalling customer service i am a virgin media cable tv broadband and landline customer earlier this month virgin media offered to set me up with a sim with o as the two companies are now linked after the account was set up i found the terms were not as described by virgin media so i contacted o to cancel i was assured that there would be nothing to pay as i had cancelled within days i returned the sim to sender unopened three weeks later i got a text from o that my bill was overdue and would be added if i did not pay within four days i had not received a bill i was told they could help me if i passed their security check but despite giving my full name address including postcode date of birth and the correct answer to the security question that has been set up for the account i was told i had failed the security check and i needed to go to the o store with my driving licence or passport so i did and still failed their security check i was in the store for nearly two hours on the phone to customer services until i had to leave because the store closed i was still on the phone as i left and i told the representative that i needed to talk to a manager the representative kept telling me i needed to go to the o store with my photo id i kept telling her i just did that and still failed the security check eventually after i repeatedly insisted she told me a manager would be in contact with me within hours that never happened a few days later i phoned again to ask for a manager to contact me as promised the representative i spoke to that time took me through the same security checks i failed again despite giving all my correct information she told me i needed to go the the o store with my passport or driving licence i told her id already done that and failed the security check despite the manager telling the customer service representative on the phone that hed checked my id and it was me she still insisted i needed to go back to the store with my photo id and she could not get a manager to contact me because id failed the security check this could have gone on rang off and called again in the hope that a different representative would do their job i was lucky it only took a few minutes for the person i spoke to that time to sort out the problem my details i had given before and the answer to my security question were sufficient for that representative that should have happened the first time i phoned instead of me having to spend hours on the phone and in the like the plague but if youre unfortunate enough to already be in a contract if youre speaking to an uncooperative representative hang up and dial again and keep trying that until you get someone who knows what theyre doing they have at least one fortunately there were not long waits on the its three weeks since i posted this review it seems the last person i spoke to was not as good as he seemed ive had an email telling me ive got an overdue bill ive made a complaint by email to the o complaint review service its supposed to be for complaints that have gone to a manager and not been resolved to the customers satisfaction but as i was refused escalation to a manager i think its appropriate ive had an automatic acknowledgment that said someone will contact me within seven days after theyve reviewed the complaint ill update this review,Bad
898,absolutely the worst experience from start to finish the signal on mobiles is major step backwards compared to vodafone and if you use data above agreement the costs are astronomical the portal is like using the internet years ago and changes made often become unmade like adding world zone extra prior to travelling then to discover bills into hundreds shortly after landing avoid,Bad

902,the worst experience ever ive applied for a new virgin media broadband got my first engineer appointment on the th of march for some reasons it hasnt been installed yet month days ive not had any updates no text no email no phone calls to say why its not been installed ive rang vm customer care many like hour call waiting they would transfer to someone then theyll transfer to someone then hung up today i cancelled the order left virgin media ive had a hour chat with a customer care guy today he tried to give as a compensation for the delay but cannot give me an exact date of installation the so called customer care is not caring the customers at all ive never had an experience in my life nearly months for a simple broadband installation,Bad
903,run dont walk away from this absolute farce of a company with regard for customer loyalty and even less regard for customer service days of trying to upgrade a contract hours on the phone and they cannot get your address correct then try to browbeat you into signing a legal document with inaccurate information i have never had such an infuriating experience with any other company the fact that they try every diversionary tactic to keep you from actually speaking to a service rep in person tells you all you need to know my service coverage still also stinks at both home and work they promise and lie but you will be disappointed if you use them they then will try not to give you your pac code avoid,Bad
904,absolutely ridiculous you are living in the dark ages,Bad
905,absolute terrible service ever works realy slow speeds impossible to contact then as it just says are call centre are closed and then hangs up on me might just cancel my direct debit soo n contact me then,Bad
906,i have been an o contract customer for years but never again provided you do not have a problem o are fine but if you have an issue do not expect it to be resolved in january months into a month contract my phone was stolen so i called o and asked them to send me a new sim an easy task you would think months and phone calls later i still had no sim card and was loosing my patience i ordered the sim card for the last time and told them i had cancelled my direct debit and would only restart it when i received a sim card despite the manager saying he would personally email me to check i received the sim i recieved neither the sim card or the email by this time i had been months without mobile phone service and had already paid for weeks of service that i have not recieved i gave up and made alternative arrangements for my mobile phone today i recieved a letter stating that they had called and text me to let me know that my account was in arrears and if i did not contact them my number would be disconnected when i called to remind them that i did not have a sim so they could not have contacted me and that i have not had service for months they said that they can send me a new sim today i made alternative arrangements more than months ago and that was not acceptable they said that if i was disconnected i would be billed line rental for the of the contract and would have to pay the amount in arrears it took the threat of referring the case to to get them to see sense and remove the outstanding arrears i was so angry on the phone i did not ask for a refund for the weeks that i had paid and did not receive any service for i have since read a couple of other reviews for o and it is always the same service is fine until you need them to resolve a situation,Bad
907,my partner and i have a year contract with virgin media and the internet connection has been awful since day one the network goes down randomly many times during the day and is extremely slow sometimes your device shows youre connected to the wifi but with no internet connection to sum up is a waste of money,Bad
908,have been with for a long time probably nearly a decade had the most awful experience in the chelmsford branch yesterday when i tried to add a th connection to my account rude unhelpful misleading the shop is run by a teenager who lacks to life experience to understand the importance of customer service if i wasnt tied in by my contract i would vote with my feet thats the problem though they get away with terrible service because they sign people up to month deals,Bad
909,worst customer service ive ever experienced from any organisation really regretted leaving sky for these clowns or should that be cowboys customer service cannot be faulted at least they try to fix your issues instead of just passing the buck you end up so frustrated with virgin in the end that you just dont bother complaining anymore because you know its just going to fall on deaf ears compensation was promised and never given not only that but im pretty sure the virgin staff they have based in india are ringing up existing customers to trick them into giving them access to their laptops and essentially their bank accounts had a call like that claiming to be virgin media it department trying to fix the issues should have known it was a trick because virgin media never try to fix anything,Bad
910,repost from virgin mobile because i dont think they look at that bit anymore as its all virgin media these dont know what the collective noun for a bunch of incompetent mugs is but i know something close and its a heap of thing is im not even a customer nor is my wife technically but when someone badly impersonating her bought two very expensive iphones from them via carphone warehouse did our paths became inextricably discovering this we did of course do all the things you are supposed to do we contacted the bank about the fraud who stopped the transaction and changed her account numbers and applied more stringent fraud victim applications to her details we informed carphone warehouse who stopped the delivery of the phones and we informed virgin who launched an immediate investigation into it should come as no surprise really then when three months later we get a nasty letter from a debt recovery agent promising all sorts of doom and hellfire if we dont pay odd quid to them were cock all use when we contacted them they asked for account details which we couldnt provide because we dont have an account they asked for passwords we provided at the point of sale which you know we couldnt give them because we werent the ones buying these as not a customer i have to give these guys a big fat because unfortunately i cannot give them a lower this is their idea of how secure their process is of doling out phones and handling your information id just urge you to avoid them they are incapable of handling any process that deviates from selling you a bloody phone in the first place their fraud department is either non existent or just seems to ignore matters that youd think would actually be the purpose of their working all so sir richard branson can look like a smug git on you seeing as when he started out his line of business committing major vat fraud with a bunch of dodgy lps in the back of a transit you shouldnt really marvel at his entrepreneurial ability its little wonder he attracts crooks like flies on a heap birds of a feather etc only consolation because you can bet im going to get sweet old fanny adams by way of any compensation for the time and stress that being a non customer involves is that trustpilot exists and i get to vent my fury about the entire conclusion and like i said at the start a heap with one at the top too,Bad
911,the customer service is absolute crap a bunch of automatons reading from crib sheets i wonder if they would be any better if i was opening an account instead of closing it ive wasted about hrs trying to get the problem solved the only reason ive persisted is i need the pac for my phone number i am left with no option but to stop the direct debit,Bad
912,as most are probably doing with virgin theyre looking to move away to a different provider due to the price increase and the change of terms of always kind of put up with virgin as ive known customer service can be poor whatever the provider but stuck with them as i could generally keep the price i was signed up to the same year on year or been a virgin customer back to when they were diamond cable and then ntl however since liberty global took over things have slowly changed for the worse the current change was enough to push me to another provider that locks the price into term of the the one star well i wanted to terminate my contract and they made it frustrating to do so i explained my reason but apparently that wasnt enough was put on hold constantly have them challenge the reason i wanted to leave and try and refute my information by making stuff up thats guess if you treated your customers properly they wouldnt want to leave its greedy tactics and to justify it by saying everyone else does it is laughable how about bucking the trend and offering fixed term pricing without in contract price increases probably would have a lot more customers signing up than probably get some cs rep replying to this saying sorry etc but whats the point it doesnt change anything but you reap what you sow,Bad
913,internet keeps dropping out all the time rubbish,Bad
914,costumer service is not helpful when we signed a contract they told us that it was going to be possible to change the contract holder when we asked they reneged and said that we could not do that as the person who told us that did not write it in the contract,Bad

920,a couple of months ago i was in the process of leaving talk talk when they convinced me to go with a new contract of a singing and dancing broadband package fast fibre using eero all set up by outreach engineers months in no internet am straight out of hospital no internet no tv bored put of my mind to be told it could be up to days for initial contact so angry frustrated and upset i know there is life without tv but am currently housebound on crutches and there us no plan for when rhe sees patter is a believe everything you are told they lie,Bad
921,shockingly hiding behind as an excuse for their please do not use this company dont be enticed by their low initial offers once they have you they wont let you go im sure they are using underhand tactics so you cannot speak to them about cancellation calls totalling over hrs call ended by them times finally the cancellation team spoke to me after being on hold and listening to that bloody awful music for hrs she muttered something about the system and then cut me anyone in my position do yourself a favour cancel your direct debit and wait for them to get in touch with you,Bad
922,im on a regular sim only contract and due to leaving the country want to terminate the contract and they require me to pay the remaining months that i wont be using the service rip off,Bad
923,the worst telecom company customer service is hopeless app is and you cant do anything your self do not go with them if you want a hassle,Bad
924,if i could give stars i would tried cancelling my account for around a month now the company is doing every thing physically possible to make this an impossibility continuously offering better deals that i clearly state i do not want try every coercion tactic you can think of do whatever physically to halt your call if they can in my process of cancelling ive been put on hold only to be connected to another customer didnt happen once or twice but three times terrible service that wants to bleed you dry of every penny they can get out of you straight up lied to me about what month is my final bill only to send an even higher bill the following month theyll do literally anything to make it a nightmare for you not even including the automatic roaming contract you get after your original contract ends with no warning or update no email asking if you want to no nothing do not waste your time with this company,Bad
925,terrible service currently paying for mbps costing around a month at first was excellent and download speeds were indeed the minimum speed stated on the contract a month or two in and i am now constantly receiving mbps speeds have multiple times attempted to contact virgin media for support but i am constantly referred to a robot and told to restart my wifi every time i have been able to book an engineer the appointments have been cancelled as the issue has been fixed apparently extremely dissatisfied,Bad
926,shockingly poor service ages to install but speeds fluctuate from gbps to zero so often that its utterly unacceptable and unworkable,Bad
927,wondering why tesco have not acknowledged the other review reviews a very different story to this think i will probably post to both pages tesco mobile are just so incompetent ordered monthly contract phone same day spent minutes on chat to cancel after reconsidering the contract person on chat assured me that the order was cancelled dpd then advised that phone was on its way several attempts to contact tesco to advise delivery would be refused dpd tried to deliver phone but was refused confirmed phone would be returned to tesco emailed tesco complaints still no further forward claim phone not received dpd state phone being returned to tesco contract still not cancelled still no refund of initial payment i have lost patience not prepared to spend a lengthy time on the phone or chat to yet again confirm order was cancelled on the same day it was placed really tesco get your act together shocking service,Bad
928,i am not usually in the habit of writing bad reviews but on this occasion i feel duty bound to put this on record back in february i changed my broadband supplier following the expiry of my contract in march i received a bill from my new supplier and to my surprise also one from my old supplier talktalk thinking this must be an error and that i would have this refunded i left my direct debit mandate open to facilitate the refund in april and may payments were taken i was paying two broadband suppliers simultaneously after which i cancelled my direct debit mandate to prevent any further lock down was taking place it was virtually impossible to contact their call centre which i fully understood and made allowances for eventually i was informed that my account and broadband was still live and the charges were due i was receiving additional admin fees for late payment despite the fact that the line had been disconnected on the th of february this had been verified by bt outreach and my new provider when i was finally able to speak to someone at talktalk they agreed to close my account in june and waived the additional charges no refund of the extra three months payments however this has been refunded to me by my new provider as a good will hoped that finally talktalk would close my account as promised and that this would be the end of this sorry saga not so i received my latest bill again necessitating another call to talktalk each call taking a long time to get through again i was promised that my account would be closed and any outstanding charges waived again i hoped this had settled the issue two days ago i received my latest bill for august back on the phone had to give up on this and use the chat line they couldnt find my account at first but i eventually received another promise that my account would be i receive my september bill next month if so ill have to do another follow up review i know things have been very difficult lately with the present circumstances but i feel this is really poor service,Bad
929,let me start by saying when this wifi worked it was great however now its not since december we have had no wifi this has happened due to home telecom cancelling our line due to a miscommunication they believed we wanted to cancel we never wanted to cancel we then called them and they said not to worry and they will sort it months later and calls later still no fix im at the point now where they have told to reset our line months ago and its still not working do not touch home telecom with a foot barge pole,Bad

931,terrible company i guess its cheap but literally its impossible to have a conversation with a number always keeps dropping the connection cant hear a single thing the internet is and half of the time it stops roaming so even though i got the plan and i got data its not roaming calling someone will take about tries because it will just not ring on the line hang up or just ring until the person answers and you wont be able to hear all sometimes it drops midway though conversation so if you make of calls to banks and stuff or if a business person even think of getting this network its bad,Bad

1003,after unacceptable service i contacted talktalk to leave within my first days during the chat the agent only wanted to confirm her side and was getting fed up answering questions so she dropped the chat then the agent who took over also dropped the chat when a companys activity is not clear or straightforward then customers will obviously want to confirm the information they are given and question things they were not aware of but the agents simply do not want to answer questions they only seem to want you to agree with their terms which could potentially leave you at risk of getting stung for is absolutely unacceptable nothing but agro pathetically poor customer service and being messed around right from the get go do yourself a favour find a different supplier other than unacceptable service in every they seem to do when you have an issue with customer service is ask you to contact customer service probably so they can drop your chats when things get a bit difficult for them so eventually you will just forget it and the process continues with some other poor below the usual reply from talktalk inviting you to chase them around again and again this time via a social media platform or talktalk community forums these forums are no more than shoulder grease for companys like talktalk just another way to leave the work to someone have all my information and contact details on file including my unresolved complaints talktalk have already been told the situations time and time again and should be chasing me up to resolve the are obviously so used to issuing the same old standard generic replies that do not resolve issues which just makes people give up and they know this which is why they operate the way they would i want to go on talktalk community sites and forums to resolve an issue talktalk caused by shirking responsibilities by your agents not wanting to deal with issues by dumping chats and other diversionary on stop playing the naivety game you dont get a multimillion pound company by not knowing exactly what you are doing and that is what you have so get someone who can make decisions and can answer questions in detail to contact me its my money and you are not having it for free just for shrugging your shoulders and not answering questions and wanting me to agree to your terms when your agents cant even explain those terms when questioned,Bad

1020,most recent,Bad
1021,received yet another letter saying i owe exit fee been with talk talk for a month service has never worked since install we have to use g tethered and have had to take out expensive contracts with mobile supplier to cover data usage we both work from home and are totally reliant on good solid access while we use services such as rdp teamviewer skype etc for our work we also use streaming services for both our music around the house and for our tv none of this has worked since install talk talk were given every opportunity to rectify these faults yet chose not to letting us down at every point and causing untold stress disruption and spiraling costs from install to the point of disconnection then they have the cheek to demand for the pleasure not a chance see you in court the media and every review site we can find the experience hours of phone calls and so called support i use the term extremely loosely that we have had to suffer and endure is beyond anything i have ever had to deal with before word of mouth is a powerful tool and hopefully people will eventually learn not to sign up with these cowboys and use a provider that values its customers,Bad

1029,my experience is that virgin their services there customer service team is a bad joke rarely can you get the same person to call back to follow a complaint have overcharged well over double the agreed charges for fictitious phone calls their policy is too screw the customer and even where things are obviously wrong never contact the engineers usually leave the site worse than before they arrive virgin do not keep promises and do not send bills when my opinion they need,Bad
1030,bought a phone that doesnt hold charge or let you download things without switching off tried to return and site kept sending me to a page with a printing return label only it doesnt load advisor would only look into error rather than giving me the details needed to simply return phone frustrating customer service and poor quality of gaff is great but the execution has been poor for me,Bad
1031,be aware that vodafone are without permission signing their customers up to a service they then charge for vodafone secure net is peddled as them protecting their customers from fraud while they charge you a monthly fee for the unwanted service the onus is on you the customer to cancel the subscription or the monthly charge will continue indefinitely this comes off the back of large unwarranted price hikes for pay monthly customers given that there are still large parts of the country where the vodafone signal is patchy or nonexistent this is pure greed from a company that treats its customers like contemptible cash cows,Bad
1032,extremely poor customer service said they would fix the issue within hours and now there dragging it on longer and longer been without internet for a week now for them to say we cant do nothing about it until its been days when you try calling them they just hang up on and dont help you out i do not recommend talktalk to anyone worst internet provider i have been with,Bad
1033,careful buying from vm upgraded to gig fiber broadband had issues ever since installation every time we call they say it will be fixed in days call back after days and its another days to fix it this has been happening since the start of september turns out the fault was existent in august and they never told us about this fault when selling us the internet,Bad
1034,what a load of rubbish i phoned up talktalk on the monday placed my order and i was informed i would get a confirmation email with my order details with in hours i waited days still no confirmation email so ive been on the phone to them about times within the last few days enquiring were my email was which was not sent and they me off every day giving me different excuses and they informed my current supplier that i was transferring to talktalk on the th march and the date given to my current supply was the th of march but talktalk said to me my services will be active on the th of march which is wrong so i phoned them again and they kept saying the date was the th march i explained my current supplier had sent me an email saying i were due to transfer to talktalk on the monday th of march so i raised a complaint and they said that i would get a call back with in hours and they gave me a complaint reference number well i waited hours and still no call from them so i phoned talktalk and i gave them the complaint reference number but they said the complaint wasnt raised as it was the wrong department i was off yet again so i had enough and cancelled my order and i was going to go with some other company which is what i did and i had no problems with the new company ive just placed order with so far and the company who ive now placed an order with has sent me an email of confirmation email and start date and they have also dispatched my welcome pack with in a couple of hours placing my order and i can track my order and progress on line when i log in to my account so please bear in mind and think hard when thinking about taking a broadband and telephone service from talktalk they are waste of time and effort they are rubbish,Bad
1035,absolutely disgusting customer service they will get you in the net start charging you through the roof and then make it impossible to cancel bordering criminal organisation avoid at all costs,Bad
1036,i cancelled my contract two weeks ago they sent me out a letter saying they would refund me if i paid out any extra money they sent me out a bill two weeks later total lack of communication i phoned them and they still said i owe them the bill hopeless,Bad
1037,horrendous customer service just spent restarting and fiddling with the box before spending an hour and eight minutes on the phone because of an error code es that they dont even recognise obviously its not resolved and now have to wait hours for a call from somebody all because i brought a film to watch with my five year old on a sunday evening best part been a customer for twenty years and pay a month for this joke of a service and ridiculous customer service the call staff are a joke look out sky here we come,Bad

1041,bt broadband helpdesk is the most shocking bunch of wasters i have ever come across their level of ability to handle and resolve issues is unreal after waiting on the phone mins i still have no resolution never buy any services from bt go to another provider bt are a fing joke,Bad
1042,avoid where have mis sold me a fibre broadband with confirmation installation date the installation date has now passed when a engineer turned up on the day to say does not have necessary equipment on van to carry out the job absolute shambles and yet cannot provide a basic internet yet happy to sell the product,Bad
1043,one month without internet engineer visits and three routers later and still received an invoice for an engineer visit even though the engineer clearly agreed that it wasnt my equipment that was at be all three routers can how a reply on a review takes less than an hour yet i wait hours and days for a response and call backs to my emails and phone final straw comes when i phone the tech desk and have a completely infuriating and an extremely unhelpful conversation with one operator who finally after minutes of arguing talking over me and me begging to speak to someone else hands me to someone who is actually helpful says he will actually escalate the problem to a manager a month too late still waiting for that phone call over two hours something changes drastically in the next hours i wont be renewing my expensive contract,Bad
1044,i put on call safe it blocked all my calls no one could get through i tried to take it off and was told its takes hours to do so rubbish add on like most of talktalk cant wait for my month contract to finish so i can speak to someone who understands english a crap firm don join,Bad
1045,my year old aunt who is handicapped and partially sighted and without internet moved from her old address in october we informed talktalk on the day she moved that the account should be terminated as her old address was then demolished no post was forwarded to her months later she asked me to check her bank statements and i noticed she was paying for two talktalk services the old one and the new one we immediately cancelled the old direct debit and i helped her write a letter politely asking for a refund for the old line rental pointing out that they could easily check to see that no one had used the line for over a year the letter was never acknowledged instead she started being hounded by debt collectors trying to reclaim because she was in breach of contract on the old service when we pointed out that talktalk should be paying us they ignored the error lay with them and informed us that the matter was now entirely in the hands of the debt collectors and not to contact them again disgusting i would earnestly recommend everyone to avoid this company,Bad
1046,further to the review i posted on th october in respect of the appalling service responses and attitude from vodafone in respect of my broadband installation i had a further installation date booked for today th between and however despite messages received confirming an engineer would be visiting to carry out the install at no engineer has arrived another day taken off work for nothing further appalling service from vodafone do not use this company use any provider as long as it is not to my review above another response received from the vodafone media team pity vodafone do not invest in employing people to resolve problems for customers rather than people to kick the can dien the road do not use vodafone unless you wish to appalling service and no resolution to problems,Bad
1047,awful service signed up to a service which was fine at first then they cut services removed a local mast and i lost signal calls kept getting cut off had to change service but they still demanded money for a service they could not provide,Bad
1048,absolute shambles from beginning to end i changed contracts from to talk talk responded saying heres a better deal i accepted i cancelled my move to talk talk with days notice before my handover go live date talktalk ignored the cancellation whether they decided to do so knowingly trying to keep a new customer or through ineptness probably the case im not staff i spoke to seemed not interested or apologetic and were unable to grasp what had happened after many hours on the phone with at least different departments they said it would take a week to sever the connection they also charged me for using their service which i didnt want and cancelled in due from start to finish never would use or recommended such an appalling company,Bad
1049,virgin media is the worst company i did not meet another as well i changed my address and they have no signal in this area at first they said it is not my fault and i should not pay the tax disconnection just to return the equipment i returned all the complete equipment and surprise over a month the ball with to pay i rang and they gave the phone from one to another i did not receive the answer to my did not recommend virgin media dear clients are many other serious companies be careful,Bad
1050,after putting up with poor wifi for way too long a was informed that virgin offered a booster so decided to ask for one only to be informed they didnt have stock and if they did they charge you a month for their problem nice,Bad
1051,home phone line not working and virgin media no support at all sent me a text with link to web page unfortunately i had been on that before i rang result is no answer and still without a landline,Bad
1052,going down hill rapidly their app is a pile of crap always having issues and you cannot get through their ivr to speak to someone bloody useless company with crap services,Bad
1053,load of crap ive had the miss fortune to come come across gig my ass more like good job your not an i end up with mrs brown,Bad
1054,so after reading much reviews and searching around i decided to take the gamble with talk talk fibre broadband they say the first few day as may be a little slow so u have to give it some time to really see if its quick or not it turned out to be marginally faster than normal broadband and did seem to cut out a few times too over the next days of my trial so i was originally trying to speak to them as to why it keeps cutting out and could they fix the problem but i couldnt get through on the phone after numerous attempts to call so on what i thought was the th day and worrying about being tied in to these guys for months i thought right ive gotta cancel and change provider quick as if i have a problem and it takes this much effort to try and get through to someone then i do not have the patience for this i then go on to there live chat to someone who then asks me hundreds of little questions in the chat box about who i am etc my password my family details etc etc and so on then tries to diagnose the problem with these silly little chats so i ask can she call me as this is silly on here trying to work out whats wrong with your service she says sorry she can fix it on here so i say i want to cancel the service right away she then spends the next mins on this silly chat box asking me why i want to go and to stay etc i tell her that the service has not been great and that if i have to try and fix problems on your line like this ill end up pulling hair out and also my trial ends today and im certainly not having your service i cancel it and get a new and pay the months price of for the service ive used i have now received emails telling me of a cancellation charge of so after calling there so called customer service abroad it turns out i cancelled on the st day without realising so the charge stands and if i dont pay it will go against my credit rating there is also nothing they can do with the charge amount as i signed the contract and cancelled within it even though it was pm the next day and the service in the days i had received was shabby dont be fooled people and even if u have to pay slightly more i wouldnt go near talk talk unless u like problems fixed over chat transcripts never again will i be fooled,Bad
1055,they are not help me at all they promise and never do nothing,Bad
1056,worst provider ever i was warned by several friends about talktalk but decided to go with them anyway because they were day one nothing but trouble bad connection booked in engineers that never turn up after taking time off work argumentative phone staff terrible customer service charged the wrong price loss of personal details said they lost the recording of when i agreed to the contract and price this provider has cost me hundreds on top of me and my other mobile phone bills its that slow and useless we dont even connect hence we go over on our phone data ever tried connecting my phone to do a speed test and its that bad my phone cant even complete a speed test clear of this provider,Bad
1057,star because no stars is not an option so let down by virgin media i have been a customer for years and have tried to contact someone to speak to them about my contract and how your minimum guaranteed download speed is nowhere near what i am getting every time i call i am on hold for an hour and then give up as i have an actual job to do rather than wasting hours trying to speak to your customer service team not great customer service that your automated message also directed people to which is an error page so again absolute rubbish service making people go round the houses so in the end after almost a week of trying to cancel my service i cancelled my contract over whatsapp as it was impossible to speak to anyone and the whatsapp message bot said that no one could call me cant believe you can actually treat loyal customers like this i would have likely renewed my contract if i was able to have an actual conversation with a helpful human,Bad
1058,terrible internet providing service goes down looking to sign with another provider,Bad
1059,had nothing but trouble from day one six months later still not sorted but im still paying full price every month made two separate complaints and heard absolutely nothing back from them both will never have virgin again after my experience,Bad
1060,failure of internet unavailable now for more than hrs after attempts and hrs of trying issue still not resolved agent closed line on me online chat result still no internet connection i need to talk to a voice,Bad
1061,did not get internet for a total of months charged me to cancel the contract even though i did not receive any service,Bad
1062,if you read through all of these reviews you will see a myriad of terrible experiences often with no resolution you will read about the amazingly customer service and complete disregard for the customer you will read of the poor quality of the products and services offered by virgin media and how often they fail you could be forgiven for thinking that these are isolated or disgruntled customers or former employees but no virgin media really are this bad if you are not a virgin media customer i you to choose any other provider each and every one of their services are flawed overpriced and destined to cause you problems to which you may never get a resolution choose any other provider,Bad
1063,rebuked on installation date will cost me thousands in lost business unable to contact date for installation was supposed to be today got a automated text message at last night saying it had been cancelled cannot cancel contract and stay with bt as now committed for months i wish i had read before this has to be the worst company i have ever dealt with and no of contact to complain to do not use this company at any cost its simply dreadful,Bad
1064,switched to talktalk for phone tv and broadband in november from bt as i was looking to save money worst mistake of my life installation and switch went fine but i was consistently getting slow speeds trying to get help from talktalk is a nightmare you have to wait for ever for someone to answer the phones shortest waiting time was around minutes and longest was had to phone many times and everytime they ask you the same questions and make you go through the same steps to troubleshoot really really frustrating especially as they found it difficult to understand my scottish accent and i had to keep repeating myself in the end they told me that there was nothing wrong at thier end and my devices must be faulty so a mac ipad android phone box and kindle all develop a wireless fault at exactly the same time i dont think so gave up eventually then my tv box which is extremely slow and unresponsive compared to the bt box developed a fault and had to be replaced the second box had the same fault and so they arranged an engineers visit for the next day after three hours on the phone i had to cancel the appointment due to a family medical emergency and they charged me for it so id had enough i understand that sometimes things you wrong but it shouldnt be this difficult to get things fixed ive switched to which is a bit more expensive but they answer the phone within seconds from a uk call centre since the switch all my faulty devices are now receiving data at the speed i pay for talktalk can take me to court for the cancellation fee and the remainder of my contract id relish the opportunity to inform a court just how badly they treat their customers honestly the worst company ive ever had to deal with awful experience id avoid them like the plague,Bad
1065,absolutely disgusting company nothing shy of crooks so i took out home phone and broadband which btw the broadband isnt overly great anyway months later i took out a mobile phone contract i only wanted the handset as i already had a sim to use so as soon as the contract sim arrived i threw it away yet im being charged hundreds of pounds for apparently donating to charities via my phone bill upon raising this with vodafone nothing was done and i was also being overcharge as my discount wasnt being applied i refused outright to pay for these mysterious charges but despite me paying my home phone and every month on time they decided to block my service until i pay the mobile contract i explained the broadband is a completely seperate credit agreement which they refuse to acknowledge so now im left with a mobile bill plus early termination charges as well as being charged for the next months of home phone and broadband that i cant use absolute con response to i do not believe for one second that the sim card has ever been used since it was snapped up and thrown away immediately upon arrival these charges dont even exist its simply a way for you to try and scam people out of money and if they refuse to pay you destroy their credit rating after spending over hours on the telephone to rude incompetent staff i have absolutely no interest in having any more dealings with you this review is purely to warn others of your deception in the hope they dont make the same mistake by taking out any products with youi seriously suggest you buck up your ideas and sort out this sham of a company because judging by the poor star rating and terrible feedback you have im far from the first person to be utterly disgusted by the lack of service you provide and shocking lack of customer service skills,Bad
1066,all day no signal and min per money for nothing,Bad
1067,absolutely terrible please please save your self and do not go with,Bad
1068,unbelievably bad company to deal with ordered a lg g handset as part of their black friday deals confirmation order followed with delivery days noted no further communication since now th dec if you fancy a laugh or good picture of how pathetically vodafone have dealt with their customers google vodafone lg g hot uk deals black friday staff on their online chat are outsourced and know as much as i do about the order status ie nothing i lodged a complaint through their complaint page i have received automated emails that just direct me back to the online chat with no formal response despite being promised a phone call phone calls lead to hours on hold staff that have no answers and promises of call backs that never materialise basically if vodafone make a mistake they either ignore the customer completely or blame the customer staff either dont have the correct information to hand or have to work with order systems that dont speak to stock systems occasionally they tell you plain untruths just for good measure i doubt my phone order will ever turn up and i doubt ill hear anything whatsoever from vodafone a quite simply breathtakingly bad experience if you read even a tenth of the reviews here and still continue on to buy from vodafone then your heads gone avoid at all costs,Bad
1069,hi nic thanks for taking the time to leave a review im sorry that youre thinking of leaving us for another supplier if youd like to speak with a member of our team about the price of your current package please send our team a text on we would be happy to look at any deals of offers that are currently available to you laurie,Bad

1078,i will be sending a letter of complaint as the service is appalling let down on installation dates which isnt good when you work online and have no internet this also means i lost money and i will be applying for compensation the day before the first installation date they moved the date out weeks with no apology then i needed permission from the neighbour which they knew about weeks prior i feel it was used as a delay tactic as that was just before the new years holiday so everyone was away why was i expected to obtain this and not virgin why did they leave it weeks before advising this requirement id just moved house and hadnt met my neighbour at that stage thankfully she is lovely and tried to help as much as possible virgin did not advise anyone of the actual work required they just expected my neighbour to sign to date i still have no idea whats happening nobody responds nobody apologises they just expect you to wait ive now canceled virgin and my god that was just as painful how can they continue to get away with this appalling why dont you call me with an update,Bad
1079,awful company moved house to find out there are no cables out the front booked weeks in advance and have been told we have to wait until the end of the month to get it sorted i have just noticed they have been charging my dad nearly just for internet he is vulnerable and hard of hearing i am beyond angry to speak to anyone is awful you get passed through various departments they will not get another penny of my dad we have went with bt and they are able to install in days i have filed a formal complaint and will file another report to the ombudsman dont bother ringing them to find out whats happening nobody speaks to each other and nobody knows what the other departments are doing i would urge everyone to be vary wary of this company i have been a customer for over years it is just unbelievable customers should not have to pay the price for their mistake i have requested all our phone bills to be covered for the month as we are all using our mobile data to stay in touch with people ill not even talk about loss of earnings with expecting an engineer days in a row and nobody showing,Bad
1080,they have become too big and do not care about loyal customers i had to call them times over hours of waiting to hear they cant help they quoted me a price and could not do the price so cut me off terrible service use another network years a customer no more thank you,Bad

1082,unfortunately it doesnt give me an option to leave less than one star otherwise i would i wouldnt recommend virgin media to my worst enemy the problems ive had changing my deal to include pods have been horrendous the customer service is the most appalling ive have ever seen in my life ive been lied to by multiple people most of them have not done or done the absolute opposite to what ive asked for each time the representative has been from multiple different countries and apparently they arent allowed to feed back to each other information about how theyve failed to do their jobs or do their jobs incorrectly i spoke to a manager at one stage who was ridiculously argumentative and condescending no one seemed to have a clue what they were doing it asks for a date of experience my awful experience with them has encompassed many many different phone calls for many many weeks when i had enough of the complete lack of service etc i was basically told its tough you cant leave or youll be fined a large cancellation fee,Bad
1083,i was tied into a contract for broadband with virgin media and would have been charged an extortionate fee for leaving early even though i never got the speeds i was paying for when my contract ended i tried to cancel my contract through the app but got a message saying my wifi speed was insufficient to connect even though i could access other apps i tried their whatsapp service but got a message saying they were too busy to deal with me that day then i phoned but was put through to someone who didnt seem to fully understand or speak english and there was a long delay on the line making communication difficult i explained that i wanted to end my contract as the monthly price was too high they responded by offering to half the speed i was getting for for a month more naturally i didnt take them up on this they then tried to charge me for ending the contract early which i hadnt done i was amazed at the,Bad
1084,ive been with talktalk twice on both occasions the service was fine for the first to months then goes downhill due to a shocking wifi signal they put their prices up mid contract this time and i decided to leave within the days window which meant i was not charged however ive been harassed by emails saying i owe them for leaving mid contract then an additional for late payment despite the fact i have another email saying my balance is zero and any charges have been waived terrible service and ill never use them its impossible to chat to a human whose first language is english or email them and i dont do facebook twitter etc,Bad
1085,my mother who is a long term customer of talktalk for over years wanted to create an account online simple right the website didnt recognise details so she went and spoke to amanda on customer service over live chat i read their transcript and its the worst customer service ive ever seen and i work in live chat myself for another showed no empathy or patience towards my mother who isnt great with tech so going on chat was a big deal for her she felt unwelcome speaking to amanda as she gave my mother very blunt answers or template answers she was rude and after my mum said ok thanks amanda immediately sent a goodbye template message and closed the chat couldnt be bothered to ask if theres anything else she could help customer service is busy yes were in a pandemic and staff is very short but there is no excuse not to go above beyond for a customer just because they dont have a current answer for x question was absolutely disgusted to see the level of service my mother received and will strongly reconsider changing provider over this so she can get a much better customer service all over creating an online account,Bad
1086,the online chat agent did not provide me with accurate information for signing up and keeps trying to pressure me into signing up through the chat it was confusing with two different deals online and deals they provided on the chat and when i asked for confirmation of the info i saw online they just said you can go for it then with a really bad attitude the experience felt horrible,Bad
1087,absolutely awful service mins on hold manager after having to verify my identity all just to cancel my contract when they are quoting me more for a contract compared to vodafone,Bad
1088,offered free anytime upgrade great placed order and advised of slight crack in screen and agreed that a fee would be applied for the damage fair enough spoke with customer services as the fee needed to paid up front to be told i would need to pay or cancel the upgrade upgrade cancelled and contract will be taken out else where as soon as possible,Bad
1089,worst company ever i spent hours and hours on the phone trying to close the account after months it was finally closed they sent me a label to collect the kit was collected in a random day with no notice and now i have received email that it was not collected potential customers run away as far as possible they are truly incompetents,Bad
1090,awful experience i would never recommend this company surprised they are still broadband providers their support team are awful to deal with many of them are rude and dont really have the customer at heart my months contract with them was a terrible decision and it was indeed a very long month contract with many blips along the way if the service goes its gone for hours or days at end when you call the support team you just get a robotic response of problem in the area and thats it speeds as well,Bad
1091,disgusted how i was lied to by open reach took a day off to sit and wait for internet to be installed was told by engineer it will be on within the hour and he left days later still no internet and no update will be changing my provider straight away,Bad
1092,billing service is totally incompetent they messed up bills that we had to sort they assured us over and over it was sorted as we paid right away now they have gave us bad credit rating and we can no longer get finance criminal,Bad
1093,i dont understand emailed me asking for a good review despite the fact that i hadnt asked for anything to be fixed it reminded me that my internet crashes when someone calls me on the landline so i reported it and they me this has happened before they didnt fix a problem until i put it on im hoping they will see this report and fix the problem please stop my internet crashing when someone phones me i tried it with and without a it makes no i say i dont understand them wouldnt it be easier to have a system where customers could report faults directly to rather than having to go through,Bad
1094,if i could give no stars i service is a joke do all they can to keep you on the line costing a fortune in call costs,Bad
1095,i used on line chat and there was no response at all to my questions not even an acknowledgement i waited for hours but nothing,Bad
1096,i am an existing customer and yet they insist on trying to sell me new things i have asked repeatedly for them to remove me from their list the other issue is there customer service telephone number the people at the end of the line have very poor english and i feel it must be a terrible job dealing with frustrated english people all day long i tried to call up because my vodafone online account wont work three times now each time i have had my account removed but its not worked its interesting how native english speakers are all ready to call you at pm every evening but not on the other end of the line when you need help,Bad
1097,everytime i go to watch something on tv it says error code and has to reboot itself weve had three technicians to look at it and still doesnt work the internet is terrible and keeps going on off all the time but the tv is the they are junk sky are much better we used to hv them but changed to this junk now im gonna get sky again,Bad

1107,on their website they claimed to provide a minimum of mb download this was also promised by an advisor on their chat service i have kept record of my internet speeds and have noted that in a month there has always been at least days where it is below these speeds many days being under mb when i tried to complain they just always resorted to asking me to reset my router which always did nothing the communication with them is really bad and i doubt people ever get anything fixed talktalk advised me to purchase the fibre optic package which is a really big waste of money if you live in east london try and avoid and look for alternatives this seemed to be a valid option good price with the added benefit of guaranteed speeds but it seems it comes with a bigger headache having non responsive internet internet that cuts off and also speeds that could be achieved without the fibre optic prices it may seem difficult to turn away a cheap option but believe me i have learnt my lesson and will spend a little more for ease of mind,Bad
1108,horrific customer service my service was disconnected twice in error they shouldnt be allowed to trade utter shambles,Bad
1109,bt is such a rubbish company worst customer service agents do not know what they are doing worst internet speed never constant peak times are even customer service i tried to move bt to my new property and they insisted that i had toget another months contract i was under rolling contract and i to get another months contract as i didnt agree with item i asked to cancel bt and the agent my bt maybe because it would affect their conversion index i called again another time to ask for cancellation finally at it went well i used the live chat to ask to change my cancellation date because got a moving out date and an agent cancelled my mobile number onthe same day i called even though i asked to cancel all my services on so now i dont have a mobile number anymore vol after one hour talking over the phone and live chat to try to get number reactivated it didnt go well and the agent promised me thathe would call me on next morning it didnt happen all that stress i still have to pay because i cancelled even i stayed with them for months and i was in a a rubbish company i will chase my rights as a customer and i am hereto tell everyone that this company is rubbish,Bad
1110,so i sign up to mb broadband as i work from home its a requirement pretty much in this period of time virgin has managed to miss an install date have a rather sullen engineer come out and inspect the property only to be told it needs another team to do some work bounce a phone call around a call centre when another date was missed and then lose my contact information i was asked to check my account for updates i cant even set up an account until the install date overall i appear to be setting myself up for more problems and am seriously considering the wisdom of proceeding as should you edit so in response to the reply below i figure ill give them the benefit of the doubt however the number attached is for a automated triage bot which is circular in its approach and doesnt actually pass you on to an agent so well done virgin this is the first example i think ever where im thoroughly unimpressed with a supplier before ive even started the service,Bad
1111,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad

1114,following the merge of virgin and o and the release of the iphone i thought it was about time that i upgraded my mobile device i received an email about volt benefits and thought why not i go to concerts enough for o priority to be worth it the actual process of applying for the phone was incredibly straightforward what i am not happy about is being misled when it comes to the actual stock levels of the product had i taken the phone out from any other provider i would have had it within two days of my order instead i am being told that i will have to wait at least weeks before my order will arrive at my home and based on some of the entries i have seen on the o community forums this wait could potentially be extended to weeks i dont have the best credit history so ive had to part ways with already in order to even get the phone in the first place following the merge you would surely think virgin and o would bring their stock levels together to alleviate this historic issue of os but unfortunately not,Bad
1115,worst service i have ever received i have been waiting for a month now for to pull themselves together we had our third cancelled engineer appt yesterday where it essentially transpires that had lied to our provider vodafone saying that the person in the house at the time of the appt had instructed them to cancel our order which is absolute rubbish i was in the house all day and no one ever even arrived to my knowledge as i say this is our third cancelled appt we have already been waiting a month and the next available appt is the th may apparently so waiting for approx weeks there is no way to contact directly its just a joke would love for someone to reply on here to help,Bad
1116,very disappointed i requested a new email address just over a month ago i was told it had been set up but when i tried to set the account upon my computer i couldnt access it i have now been told because it has not been used for days only asked for it last month it has been deleted and cannot be used again,Bad
1117,most appalling customer service possible nobody knows what theyre doing its a complete shambles when the technician arrived he told me that everything customer service had told me was rubbish and the equipment sent was useless it would be funny if this wasnt so time consuming and im paying for a non service in the meantime then they threaten you with extortionate cancellation charges when you want to leave this mess the company operates like a bunch of gangsters where their inefficiency actually preserves their revenue,Bad
1118,absolute thieves increased my monthly pill by now im stuck with them for another year and theres nothing i can do about it someone needs to take these thieves to court,Bad
1119,absolute shocking treatment as promised im leaving reviews for companies that took advantage of people during a pandemic you been one tried to cancel my contract which was impossible saying this is an emergency line only for but upgrades was still open but couldnt cancel any contract so i paid an extra months a month then finally got through months later an cancelled to he told they had a day cancel period so had to pay another month another loyal customer down the toilet and i promise i will never use again disgusting behaviour,Bad

1122,trying contact on since i lost my job because of weeks there is no possibility to downgrade contract online been with them for years and no more if my contract will finish rating below zero,Bad
1123,first months was very good value as soon as that ended the charge doubled when i phoned up the customer services treated me like dirt then dropped the price to keep me hooked in till june i then found that the service was slower and sometimes cut out for a few minutes several times a was fine till i moved home i couldnt cancel it still paying even though im in a temporary rental which has made a written complaint which was addressed by a phone call to say id have three free months to make up for not having used it that was february i then had an email to say my complaint was closed but im left with a bitter taste in my mouth so as soon as my contract ends ill go to a no contract deal,Bad
1124,my wifi barely works when it does it drops in and out on going issue for the past months,Bad
1125,most difficult company in the world to talk to or get information from avoid like the plague avoid bt broadband like customer service consistently rude and unprepared dont know a thing always need to get someone to call you back when you want to ask how to cancel but when you want to sign uo for more they seem to know it all its like they are there to wind you up,Bad

1127,bt has to be the worst provider ever looking at the star rating here says it all rock bottom i switched to bt couple months ago thinking my speeds would be better than talktalk or shell fibre but infact its much much worst when i was with shell fibre talktalk i was getting mbps and stable after swapping to rubbish bt british trash my speeds have dropped to mbps total rubbish and a ripoff at bt broadband dont waste your time and money with these scammers robbing baskets avoid or get scammed by bt british trash,Bad

1129,wait till they get their claws in then the prices go way have been with virgin for several years now but are out of contract and about to relocate because our loyalty discount has now been removed our bill has shot up by to per month and the only way we can get that price down to how it was before is to commit to a new contract but as we are hopefully moving and dont know if the new house will have virgin we would then have to pay over to in a nutshell virgin have us over a barrel if we cancel now we have to pay another company for install if we stay they are charging us way too that with the fact tivo is way out of date and incredibly slow there is not a chance in hell i would even consider using virgin when we customer service were totally non understanding and basically cut me off beware also you have to pay to call customer complaints,Bad

1155,if i could rate the service lower i general lack of competence when dealing with users over the phone is astounding to me i was on hold for minutes before getting through to an argumentative inattentive foul mannered he was one is for such a big company the person spoke over me came across as disinterested and very insistent that my mobile contract for which ive had over years did not exist on their is why i say that a lack of competence was shown as i have had calls about it in the past much to the same extent although they have never once stated that the contract couldnt be found on the system until read my card number for which i clearly stated the numbers for twice completely wrong and with only digits recited i provided digits and insisted that the card number was such in worst part is i do not even know the persons name as they did not give it to me and when i asked for it the subject was avoided regardless of how adamant i may have been in getting said on a service desk myself taking call this service truthfully baffled me as if i had even come close to this persons level of service i would surely not be working on a service desk now or in future,Bad

1186,horrible customer service due to their inter department and bureaucracy i called them on rd september to transfer the account to my wifes name but as this will involve in new contract we asked them to revert this in the same phone call i have been promised that everything will be as it is before the phone call started so i do not need to worry about either a new contract or disconnection but guess what on th september they closed my account so i call them the next day to reinstate services i was again promised that everything will be restored within hours that too did not happen so after more than days i am still with no broadband and telephone line i called them again and was on call for hour and minutes instead of restoring the services their sale team was trying to sale me new cheaper contract this is despite telling them repeatedly that i do not want to sign any contract,Bad
1187,there is nothing to commend this company website doesnt work false promises are made mis selling customer service is non existent the list goes on unfortunately i signed a two year contract and was unable to end it earlier thankfully it is coming to an end shortly i would be more specific but cannot check my account as the website isnt operating and they cannot tell me avoid at all costs,Bad
1188,if it was possible to give a score less than that would be the have had an ongoing issue with our internet connection since the beginning of december i have lost count of the number of times we have had to call talktalk to try and resolve this each time the issue seems to be something different we get told open reach will be sent in hours we then get told they have been to the outside exchange but see no improvement they come to the house no improvement and the circle starts all over again of waiting another hours for someone to look into the new issue this loop is currently restarting with some new fault being suggested to be the cause we have raised a formal complaint and were promised via text message a call back today between pm yet got no call this is now having a massive impact on our household at a time where the government has set out should be carried out where possible plus trying to teach school age children with a lack of internet is proving near on impossible its clear that talk talk show no clear understanding of how to deal with this issue nor do the customer service skills seem to be up to the standard required to take the time to follow up on the have now located a complaints procedure online as this was not sent to us when initially requested and i will be escalating this issue to the ceo office and beyond if it is not sorted anyone considering moving to talktalk i would avoid at all costs as soon as we are able to switch provider we will be leaving a company that shows no interest in their customers does not deserve our reference cmp,Bad
1189,i bought a mobile broadband device on from their store at bristol the device turned to be did not provide continuous connection due to a battery issue i brought the device back to the store on and was told that they could not provide a new one because they were out of stock and they did not know when the next stock would arrive the young lady suggested me that i go to yate to get a replacement device on ie the following day as they were closed on or call their customer support centre to ask them to send a replacement device and i could send my current device in return she did not want to speak to their customer service for me as it was not her came home and called the customer service as the lady in the store suggested the gentleman who answered the call said that he could not help as it was a store issue he alternatively suggested to get a new contract and pay so that he could send a new device to me then i called the customer complaint centre however the lady who answered the phone basically refused to help too saying again that it was a store issue i went back to the store and another lady spoke to me on the issue god she was so rude and not helpful at all in the end we agreed that i go to yate to get a new device yes it was open on even though the previous lady said it was closed after i insisted her to call their yate store for the assurance that they would provide me with a new device she was not happy to cooperate though the issue is that they provided a faulty device which resulted in my not being able to use their service as expected and as a whole company they refused to help to get a replacement device the lady i spoke in the store at first even provided incorrect information furthermore they flatly said that i could get a new device if i opened a new contract and paid for a new device even though the device was within month warranty this company obviously considers that they do not have to provide their service as expected and they can pass a customer around when things go did i not terminate the contract because those guys in mobile industry are all the same i try to stay away from them when i can,Bad
1190,you couldnt make it up spent an hour on the phone arranged new broadband contract confirmation email comes wrong address easy i think small admin error no youll have have to ring cancellations and cancel and start over no i said your mistake you cancel it they did eventually sales rang back after complaints was made cant do a new contract because the old one is still stacked on the system after many hours on the phone and speaking to around different people and being passed from pillar to post they are ringing me back to hrs today the th after the system has a chance to catch up get a message at am to say will be contacted between am to am today yes already missed that slot wait in all day no call i give up and are going elsewhere,Bad

1197,awful been waiting months for a manager call back and nothing being done about my complaint will be leaving for once my contract is up next year,Bad
1198,theres a reason why open reach dont speak direct with customers and it certainly isnt data protection as they like to tell you we bought a new build and working in the industry and knowing theres usually some issues around getting connected we ordered our broadband via sky who are equally to blame in all of this on the date of exchange weeks prior to moving in here we are weeks later and funnily enough we have no internet sky blame open reach open reach claim they can only do something if sky raise a complaint with them and then we go back around in circles with sky saying they cannot do anything until open reach update their system having open reach solely responsible for connecting customers to the network and no way of customers contacting them is just diabolical i cannot believe the competition authority actually allow this to happen there should be more than organisation responsible for connecting customers to the internet and if that were the case theyd have to start caring about customers in order to win business instead they are allowed to hide away behind the internet service providers claiming everything has to go via them and it can be a perpetual blame cycle where each blames the other in reality we are in a pandemic unable to work from home having to work in public places getting exposed to and now having to self isolate losing days and days where we are not able to work from home getting more and more fearful over losing our jobs as we are not able to work effectively sitting around for hours on end waiting for engineers that never show up then not being able to call anyone to get an update as we have to speak to our broadband company first who then have no update on their system as they are waiting on open reach to update at their end i simply cannot believe that in this day and age this is acceptable this has been a living nightmare for the last weeks and i am genuinely of the opinion this could be months before we get connected it takes weeks just for sky to book anything in and then when the engineer doesnt show despite sitting in the house all day waiting it will be another weeks minimum before we can book someone else in who is also likely to never show up as well this is being reported everywhere i can think of something has to be done from the customers point of view as it is just not right to allow this to continue where they dont have to answer to the customers no other business gets to hide from their customers so why is it allowed for open reach,Bad
1199,was given the wrong sim cards that did not match the contract signed so had to return to the shop and it took ages for it to be sorted out,Bad
1200,had a terrible experience with virgin and thought anyone could be better admittedly talktalk arent as bad as virgin were see trustpilot reviews for them but still absolutely pathetic when i took the account out they said they could guarantee mbps even though this is ridiculously slow its to do with the location im in and essentially theyre the only provider do a month contract whereas every other was months im temporarily renting in between selling a house and moving again so thats my position the broadband is running at mbps and is essentially unusable at this speed or lack of speed ive reported the issue about times and have even got as far as them acknowledging they arent providing what they guaranteed they said days ago theyd phone me back and havent done so im on live chat for the th time discussing it again their website is rubbish because even if youre logged in you have to tell them who you are by going through loads of questions which adds mins before youre actually dealing with the issue im fed up of dealing with awful companies like this and will be cancelling the contract myself on the basis theyve failed to provide what they promised i know be another battle but theyre absolutely rubbish and dont use them in hindsight i should have got a g router and unlimited data sim,Bad

1203,extremely incompetent i got an iphone contract from them online and via the phone they were acting all nice on the phone but i specifically said to send the phone to my delivery address not my billing address they also had written on my account on the site the right address for delivery they delivered the phone to the billing address then they sent it again but took a month of pestering for the phone to finally arrive then they randomly took out of my account i pestered them they said sorry and put it back in again then then added international calls onto my bill an extra a month which i never asked for called them up again and they took it off final straw was a few months down the line i had my phone stolen whilst on holiday upon purchasing the phone they said i had full insurance included in the phone package i called up to report the stolen phone they said yep no problem well send you a new one and a sim card a sim card came through but no phone pestered them for a month they then said i have no insurance whatsoever therefore cannot have a replacement i do not recommend this company to anyone out of for me they have poor communication and extremely incompetent,Bad
1204,slow broadband and lies about jeremy corbyn we will be cancelling our subs to virgin in protest of your founders interference in the politics of the uk mind your own business stop being so,Bad
1205,i tried to cancel contract for providing internet was told on first call not to do it then but on a specific date i duly phoned back on that date and was disconnected immediately after discussion it was agreed that i did not have to pay disconnection charge given previous information i had been given i then received a bill for again i phoned and was assured i would not have to pay this bill surprised to see they have taken this from my bank account the time taken to get someone to answer a phone call and then to speak to staff who obviously not up to the job is both frustrating and disheartening even if you do discuss issue and are reassured it is resolved it is not if i could i would sadly give zero stars inadequate response i was told on two occasions that i would not be charged and on a separate occasion told the date i should formerly cancel a perfunctory apology that i was given the wrong information does not address being told the wrong information three times and neither is there any indication that you are going to improve your customer service very sad to see what was once an impressive company deteriorate,Bad
1206,this company have no interest in helping their customers they make the smallest task incredibly hard feels like they do this to make you think its not worth the agro and just stick with what you have just to do something simple like cancel a sim only contract that i have had for days trying to deny me my right to change my mind within days they state its written on the contract you sign however this wasnt made clear to me or explained at all a very sly company that is quick enough to take your money but squirm over sorting things out for you luckily im young and not a push over i feel sorry for any vulnerable people that have to deal with this company,Bad
1207,the people in total just didnt listen to what i needed they have not changed my faulty box unwatchable and gave me a day and date that did not match to do so only noticed when checking the calendar they were only focused on changing the broadband router i was on the phone for about hours with the calls so i am dreading having to call back my next call is to cancel everything,Bad
1208,great review,Bad
1209,complete scammers utter takes them months and months to try and change my number over and not one person that works there knows how to do it was forced to pay for contracts for two months while they try and change my number accross only to tell me that it cant be done,Bad
1210,follow up from my review days ago in response to tesco mobile i have contacted you and all you say is my phone number will be restored from to hours now its now days without my business phone number i have also been emailing the tesco ceo ken murphys team they said i would get my number back by yesterday when my first bill would be generated i am at a total loss of what to do as it seems there is nobody in the uk that can pick up the phone and get this sorted i have now had nearly weeks without my business phone and have not earned any wages tesco business mobile probably works well until they get a problem it would be nice if someone from this company picked up the phone and called me my number should be but at this moment i have this phone number which is the number for someone in northampton called lewis,Bad
1211,to be clear no one was rude i feel i was misled on the need for a new phone line and phone number this has meant i have paid my previous service provider for may and june and well as you lot i understood you would notify my previous provider of the change but of course you dont do that if theres a new line but you didnt make it clear to me that it was my responsibility to do so its a mess and youre to blame you led me to believe i required a new line to accommodate the new high speed broadband i had a great special telephone number before the switch which i would have paid good money to keep but the inference was that i had to have a new line this has cost me months line rental and package charges to my previous provider why on earth you wouldnt make it clear that cancellation was my responsibility is beyond me i guess its because it would bring into question the need to do so and lose you the new line charges so now im forced to remain with a provider who hoodwinked me into changes and charges that were unnecessary because im penalised if i leave your live chat operators are a waste of time literally they wasted my time today ive decided im going to pay your penalty charges and leave anyway i want to be with a service provider who has my best interests in mind who has clear and unambiguous processes and provides the customer with quality consistent levels of service,Bad
1212,its one of top rubbish customer service i have ever seen in my life i had conversation with her and she want to push me to do her idea and charge me for mor money because their booster doesnt work and doesnt cover whole my house do no get virgin media internet,Bad
1213,was not helpfull at all and very rude changing my provider,Bad
1214,this company is the worst in the world emitting invoices without reason for extra charges cancelling orders without a apparent reason miss leading at all the times hard to go against them as being a huge and important company on the media services shouldnt be that way and assuming things without any sort of information or indication cancelation of my order without my consent accusing me of wanting the cancellation i have requested the deadlock letter and sar for this to be taken further in march and still to talk about the customer service they put the phone down on me several times due to lack of information and not able to respond not trained properly and lack of common response to your replyi do not know how to reply to this but i do know how to raise a complaint with virgin media and i will leave the ref number here for everyone to see what virgin medias service is like c i have been wasted working days to do so and apparently is not enough for you to understand that your management and customer service is poor i have raise x complaints and one of them was not taken in consideration this response from your side it shows how disrespectful you are instead of offering a solution you are offering me what i have already did well done you complaints department,Bad
1215,utter terrible company customer service is an utter disgrace in store the staff cannot deal with any issues everything has to be dealt with through customer services which is a chargeable number cost me over and still not resolved took trips to store and they cannot help as for signal it is shocking very poor area coverage i work all over the uk i have a business line with vodafone and did have a personal with them i would say that signal coverage is around of uk very poor indeed now im getting letters through money on a so called account years ago i have only been with vodafone years taken letter into store but what a surprise been told to ring customer services would never recommend such a poor company,Bad
1216,dont go with they put the bill up without telling me after the years was up they gave me a bill of ee is much better and more helpful,Bad
1217,the internet strength is poor the connection keeps cutting and i have fibre broadband if you move from downstairs to upstairs you need to airplane mode your phone and reconnect to get it to work oh plus they increased the price mid contract they are liars not worth it for what youre paying pay slightly more elsewhere and reduce the headache youll get here with in response to the reply i received why would i message you further on social media ive phoned and spoken to you guys about times and made a complaint do you think you bothered to contact me back or look into things who are you kidding,Bad
1218,if i could leave a zero star review i would ive been a bt business customer for many years and before that a bt customer their internet service has always been inconsistent at our property highlighted even more so when my wife started working from home and was home most days however our connection would then often magically reconnect again within minutes also for bt to even recognise this a problem i have to call up inform them my internet has dropped out mostly by the time ive been out through to somebody and they perform a magical test on my connection and guess what its fine after many phone calls an engineer came out one day after i complained again about our line dropping i was fortunate to be home when he visited as when i questioned him about me issues he showed my how many times my line had dropped out each day via his tablet and guess what it was a lot the engineer was a lovely gentleman but this infuriated me if the engineer had the technology to tell me this im sure the person i had initially raised the issue with at bt on the phone also did or they can certainly find out rather than me off until they reluctantly had to send out an engineer the engineer replaced the cable serving our house and guess what the issue was magically resolved or certainly wasnt as bad as it had been however the internet dropping went on for many months previous to this visit from december to april and at the time i asked for a refund for the months which my internet was not working properly i was passed around customer more times than i want to remember constantly having to reschedule further long phone calls with this issue but i was never happy with the offer of resolve financially as i wanted a full refund in the end my wife had our nd child and i had had enough of protracted phone calls and arguments with various operative i gave up my fight certainly not through my lack of trying more their unwillingness to help resolve this issue with a long term customer to a standard that was fair for the service i recently over the last few months our internet has started dropping out again ive had enough my family has had enough so i requested with another supplier and to change providers to sky in the process of doing so ive now been told my bt contract was magically renewed by my wife in april last year without notifying me the bill payer my wife does recall a conversation with bt but also says she was unaware this was a contract renewal otherwise she would have told me i also received no new contract or signed anything to confirm this so im struggling to understand how our contract has renewed previous to this insight regarding my contract i saw no need inform or provide reason to bt i was leaving due to being extremely unhappy with their service throughout the last few years but after receiving a letter telling me i would be charged approximately in early cancellation fees i called up well i tried i tried calling the number on the letter and i was then informed the hours for this chat would need be between am to pm during the week so again i would have to take further time out of my day to try and resolve yet another issue with bt i run a business hence the bt business package taking minute phone calls to call centers really boils my blood so i spoke to one of their operatives today who was a very nice lady in fairness but after another wasted minutes on the phone i had no option but to raise a formal complaint as i was unhappy with any of the resolves she did show understanding of my frustration with the service provided with bt but also failed to acknowledge that there has been an issue with my line as i havent raised many complaints there is a reason i dont it doesnt get you anywhere so now im trying to leave due to being an extremely unhappy customer and you are trying to unjustly charge me im sick and tired of bt youre exhausting can i also mention when i went to bt business from bt approximately years ago i was also charged an early cancellation charge of around for the privilege of swapping from bt to bt business something i was also not made aware of when taking out a bt business contract otherwise i would have waited,Bad
1219,spoke with numerous people to get an update on my order to join them how not to feel welcome i have been transferred from billing to a manager from the manager to sales from sales to order management from their back to billing and now they want to pass me back to order when you speak to someone they are inept they speak over you they do no listen and keep asking the same questions i thought bt were shocking but they are positively great compared to this lot,Bad

1224,this time all the time i had better put this towards the beginning and suggest you save your money and sanity constantly thrown out of the tv programmes that im watching then being made to watch all the adverts again just to get back to where you were streaming not what im paying for tv that your paying for is actually only free view and got so fed up of their contractual breaking that when my new to be supplier called me last week and told me they could buy me out of the final five months of my contact they had my attention after speaking to talktalk about leaving early to which they have accepted everything mentioned as suddenly got worse by far i dont believe this is a coincidence because our streaming as became impossible and the only part of our original package that still works is the freeview tv that they still charge us for do yourself a massive justice and stay away,Bad

1227,i dont often leave reviews but my experience with asda mobile has been so awful that i feel i have to to steer others away the problem is that i cannot receive incoming calls i can only receive incoming texts the problem is that asda seem to route their calls over volte voice over lte ie the calls are routed over g the problem is that if you are in an area of poor g coverage you simple dont get the calls it doesnt fall back to gsm instead the caller gets the number unobtainable tone it doesnt even go to voicemail if you try to switch off volte on your phone you cant receive any calls at all all calls get a number unobtainable tone you can make outgoing calls on gsm just not receive them it is a pretty fundamental flaw if a mobile phone company cannot correctly route calls to your phone avoid like the plague i lasted days trying to sort this out before switching again and losing my credit,Bad
1228,customer service is poor during lockdown we cancelled sky sports apparently this meant we signed up a new contract we would never have done that as we knew we were moving house so now we have been charged early exit fee even though we have been with them for years beware,Bad
1229,shocking stuff was very keen to sign up due to their fast broadband signed up and installation booked for two weeks ago engineer arrived and could not fit due to cabling needing to be run from the road should have been checked prior surely but fair enough revisit rebooked without confirming with me for two weeks later the big day arrives and same thing the engineer says they cant help and it needs to be rebooked hours later i have had to chase them five times to find out whats happening no interest in helping two days booked off form work waster waiting for them not a single phone call or email to help you will notice their new sales team are based in hampshire and are efficient and helpful but the team for existing customers based in india course it is zero support zero communication i have now taken my business to sky avoid virgin media if you dont want to be messed around i dread to think how hard it must be to raise an issue once the service is actually set up if this is the support you get when youre not yet a customer,Bad
1230,there should be an option for no stars virgin media have excelled themselves in their sheer incompetence for the past weeks i have had intermittent broadband and since no access to my emails which is important for my job i have had to spend hours on the phone several password changes i was promised i would have access to email at pm on then pm on and the latest is the morning of still no access come on virgin media get your act together,Bad
1231,awful company saying tough luck when i show them i am getting mb ps barely even enough to do a speed test most of the time kept saying check connection yet apparently im using a lot of data absolute disgusting service from their complaints team customer service basic signal threatened to do me for harassment for complaining about the service also refusing to give me a deadlock letter so i can go to the ombudsman awful experience,Bad
1232,if i could give stars i would never have i experienced such bad customer service from completely misleading marketing campaigns that lock you in for months to over charging for airtime accounts taking over months to upgrade an account falsely advertising deals they are not available and dont even exist according to their staff i have wasted countless hours on the phone to o staff each one tells you a different line i would not recommend them at all steer well clear i am not someone to write reviews often but after just having yet another phone call with a staff member that has accused me of lying enough is enough,Bad
1233,absolutely appalled with my whole experience of bt where to begin signed up to bt for phone and broadband i was given my installation date of the th of january th of january received bt hub via post email and text confirmation received and confirmed the start connection date i was advised i would receive a text or email on the day of connection to confirm everything had gone as planned however i didnt receive any confirmation discovered i had no internet connection phone line and tv so i contacted bt to be told that they had cancelled my order on the th if january as i had requested a telephone number already in use and i currently use virgin my supplier at the time before bt cancelled it was virgin do not supply the area where i live unfortunately when looking back on my emails the number they allocated me was the number i was currently using through i told the advisor that i had no internet connection ect and he said that they had informed my current supplier of the switchover so they had disconnected my service i explained that my job involves me working from home and my son is sitting his mock exams at high school to which he replied you could always connect to a wifi hotspot i explained due to my job being healthcare and the implications of gdpr i couldnt use hot spot as it was not secure he said why dont you ring and see if they can reconnect you until we can sort out a new installation date when i asked if a time scale i was told at least a week so i asked to speak to a manager as this was not acceptable to be advised that they work off the same systems so they wouldnt be able to help me i did as advised and contacted who confirmed they had received confirmation i was leaving and bt would be taking over the services they received this on the th of january the date they apparently cancelled my order i asked if they could reconnect my services and the dilemma i was in but the only way they could do it would be to sign me up for another month contract now because i have no internet connection i have had to rearrange my sky tv installation date of the th of january as of the th of january at pm i have not received any confirmation of a new connection date i have left a review of my experience on face book which has been removed by bt i am absolutely appalled and my intentions are to share my experiences on social media with all attached supporting emails and texts and take this as far as i possibly can even if it means emailing the ceo of bt mr gavin patterson update i have now submitted my concerns online to watch dog maybe everyone thats experiencing serious problems with bt or open reach should send their complaint here,Bad

1235,i wanted to join ee as a broadband customer and i joined and left only after a month tmobile as a mobile customer due to the terrible customer service i experienced tmobile subscribed me for ee broadband without my approval after only calling to ask for information therefore passing on my bank details to ee without my permission tmobile overcharged me for my mobile bill and after more than a month and a large number of calls i am still struggling to get my refund in addition orange set a direct debit of on my account without my permission and without being an orange customer ever after many calls to orange and ee and a pointless visit to an ee store as advised by an ee employee i still havent found out the reason for having a direct debit set on my account as a result of this fraud and the lack of information i have to close my current bank account to ensure this will not happen again in the future overall the customer service has been particularly bad making a few phone calls for each question i had as i was always misguided or passed on to someone else in the team who was sending me back and so oni dont normally give any negative feedback but i find the entire experience outrageous i would never join ee tmobile or orange as a customer again and i would not recommend anyone to ever join any of these networks,Bad

1237,terrible service always braking down the cables are all underground so shouldnt be any problems but a bit of snow it goes down to talk to somebody in the uk is impossible at pm i got a lady in the philippines talking to they claim they put prices up to keep a better service now the pandemic still keeps them not in uk,Bad
1238,really bad service couldnt resolve any of my issues or give me any relevant information on when they can be resolve kept repeating the same answers and ended the chat on me talktalk please fix your bots not helpful,Bad
1239,my wifi keeps freezing for like seconds and then its fine this shouldnt be happening when i go to watch something etc on phones ipads etc dont know if theres something wrong but im paying for this and its ridiculous,Bad
1240,joined vodafone over a week ago as a small business customer only transferred two handsets at first as wanted to check the service before transferring more glad i didnt commit to more as the customer service is appalling all i want to do is transfer my old number across and they cant even do that ive called multiple times and been passed around many different call centres and teams hours later and many promises and assurances that it would happen and it still hasnt the best you can hope for is a scripted answer of we are very sorry this has happened to you meanwhile zero action to fix problem days to transfer a number when theyve had the pac code from day total joke avoid at all costs,Bad
1241,basically about of the brighton to london train route has no internet particular are gatwick horley redhill havent had any internet on the majority of my commute since i joined in november they will then argue with you like it is acceptable to pay for a service you dont get and try to charge you to leave i have reported the issue to,Bad
1242,a problem reported three weeks ago is still unsolved and promised tech support did not materialize,Bad
1243,good ring product i knew that already though and not a credit to bt but appalling delivery and communication i thought the item hadnt been delivered but found after a week it had been left outside my house but open to the elements which is not ideal for an electrical item,Bad
1244,my last year with virgin media has been a nightmare of hanging on the end of a phone for up to forty plus minutes to speak to customer services always about the same thing i want to end my contract only to be told i cannot as the only way i can leave is by calling up again on the thirtieth day before my contract ends for me my contract ends on the rd july so they said i had to ring back on the rd june to give thirty days notice of termination not today which is only the tenth june i pointed out i had to inform my bank to end the direct debit plus arrange for them to collect their equipment his response was i could arrange my bank details but that virgin media no longer collected the equipment that was down to me to return it and if i did not they would bill me for the equipment and if i didnt pay they would send out debt collectors to take the value of my bill plus my credit rating would be adversely affected i pointed out they delivered the equipment and it would sit there for them to collect or i would be charging them a storage fee until it was removed or it would go in the bini take the customer care person who answered my call eventually to have meant that even though i was on a one year contract at the end of that year the package price would end even though they did not provide the services in the package but i would automatically switch on to a higher priced tariff and would have to give them thirty days notice to get out of it by paying the higher tariff in all of my seventy plus years have never heard of such a legal swindle i shall be paying particular attention to the termination details of my new provider which most definitely will not be virgin media thankfully my extended family have stayed well away from virgin after my other thing i have noticed since going with virgin is the massive increase in cold calls which has lead me to believe they may be selling our numbers on i would be very interested to hear if others have experienced a similar whyte,Bad
1245,i was with sky for years and tried out talk talk services for the last talk is way behind with customer service and reacting to customer they dont care only to excuse behind bureaucracy and issues were never sorted on the reasonable side always with inconvenience at all my contract to fibre is still ongoing horrible experience i missed out on work because of their unannounced visit i could continue with these unacceptable many times they are not even offering the contractual speeds and services but i am still paying full cannot get rid of them thats the most utterly disgusting bother with talk talk there are so many fibre optic providers with excellent offers rates and customer service,Bad
1246,this company get poor reviews for a reason they are hopeless typical big faceless company where no one takes ownership of a problem unfortunately the lowest rating i can give is a you have seen the reviews now deal with them at your own risk,Bad
1247,the talk talk customer service is absolutely shockingly bad and the internet service is a lot worse,Bad
1248,almost into the nd month and internet still not working to a satisfactory level constantly below guaranteed speed spoken to several people had engineers out more than once only people who helped were tanya on customer services who kept checking in to see if fault had been resolved and bob the last give tanya bob but would i recommend lol let me think,Bad
1249,still waiting for my upgraded telephone the sales team at appear to be idle and unmotivated it appears although the sales team had the order they neglected to put it through to the warehouse i did receive a phone call from a member of the team and he informed me he would deal with it i told him i didnt believe him he gave me a promise he would deal with it and see the job through but i was right he couldnt be bothered,Bad
1250,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
1251,were a mobile broadband device by being told it was free and then they charged us a month for the sim card we called them to query the bill and then they told us that to cancel the contract would cost and we would have to drive the miles to the nearest vodafone store to return the mobile broadband device eventually they agreed to waive the termination cost we have now been sent our latest bill and they have added without permission a charge for accidental damage cover insurance that we had spoken to noone about they also started charging us p a month for vodafone secure net that again noone had spoken to us about but was added when we renewed our contract to try and resolve these matters we phoned times spending over hours on the phone to operatives that had no knowledge of the previous calls despite assuring us each time on the phone that our account was being updated with the details of our complaint we were also promised twice that someone would call us back to confirm the matters had been resolved they never did nor did they send the email confirmations they promised to send this is the worst customer service experience i have ever experienced they make it so difficult to complain yet if you press the button to upgrade your contract you are immediately put through absolutely appalling trouble is the other mobile phone providers are probably as bad,Bad
1252,final update on the th of june i have finally left talk talk a few days early and had my new internet provider seamlessly and with complete ease connect me to their network by mid day that same day right about the same time i receive a text message from talk talk telling me our engineers have now fixed restored your internet phone line really how incredibly pathetic i thought to myself talk talk are not only incompetent at providing reliable internet phone lines but now they also take credit for other networks efforts in fixing problems right on the day of switch over just when i thought they couldnt lower their already low standards any further they do talk about a sinking ship im so glad i finally left and dont have to deal with their nonsense any more as previously said avoid talk talk at all cost and buyers beware,Bad
1253,a week ago i placed an order for a new iphone for my husband and new sim only deal for me the order was clearly not properly processed by bt as no equipment has arrived i have spoken to at least seven different people at bt but they dont seem able to resolve whatever the problem is i have had numerous emails which contradict each other and confirm deals that i havent discussed i have been promised calls back which havent happened i have received texts asking me to call them but when i do i end up in a queue and have so far wasted over three hours on the phone to this company but havent achieved anything i am about to place the order with ee and cancel with bt weve already cancelled internet and landline with them as the so called service they provided wasnt fit for purpose absolutely useless company,Bad
1254,was told given false information when taking our phone contact to get me to change from vida phone to ee absolutely disgusting,Bad
1255,i really enjoy virgin services other reviewers on here have been scathing and unkind personally i think that having an intermittent and unreliable internet is a thrilling test of my patience and really helps to build problem solving skills trying to watch adult films online while your connection stutters and jerks pun intended through the video really helped develop my focus and forced me to use my imagination one of my favourite aspects of virgin is the customer service when you report issues with your internet and are given the message of we are not doing maintenance in your area until really gave me something to look forward to and had me mark a hurrah day on my calender in lastly i was really pleased to learn that when i moved house and could no longer get virgin services that i was given the honour of still paying for a service that i could no longer receive donating to charity has always been one of my favourite past times so it was good to know that my a month was going toward a good cause in summary if you wish to develop your patience problem solving focus and imagination whilst also paying a reassuringly expensive fee for this service then virgin is the company for you thumbs up guys i should also add that whenever i did call i really enjoyed the customer service habit of referring to me as boss and their promises of dont worry well get it boxed off innit seemed quite nice and friendly i wish more companies could take this kind of laid back attitude to problems really very calming,Bad
1256,train staff properly to understand the upgrade process resolve complaints or issues quickly rather than sticking them in a queue along with everything else,Bad
1257,what a mistake joining these clowns was thank god i went back to vodafone,Bad
1258,offered fast fibre and unlimited uk calls for then told fibre not available so i have to pay for fast broadband plus for unlimited calls and that was by the customer loyalty department,Bad
1259,i was about to post a review about how bad the customer service team are and the out dated and unfair brand new customer only deals but i see i am not the first and sadly nobody at virgin media is even mildly interested enough to respond so there really is no hope for change back to sky for me,Bad
1260,quite simply the worse company i have ever dealt with please please if you value your sanity do not deal with this company i signed up for services of which they could only provide two of them but they continue to charge and take from my bank account the cost for services they provide no customer service i must have telephoned times to sort this issue out and they still continue to collect the full payment they will promise you the earth and deliver nothing,Bad
1261,the company baited me to switch and to offer quid high street voucher and after receiving confirmation letter and informing my previous administrator about quitting then they retracted and declined my application putting me in very bad condition,Bad
1262,ive been a vm customer since the days finally can take it no more a new customer will get the package i have plus a speaker for almost half the price im expected to pay as a year customer cheers vm bye bye,Bad
1263,awful always issues in my area always same excuses time wasted calling numerous time still slow seriously looking ton leave been customer over years just fed up with this now,Bad
1264,trying to talk to the agents is like talking to a brick wall the wall would understand me better mins to sort something out and then to be told to bear with the agent as was talking to customers at the same time no wonder they take so long in chat now tv which is the boost offered by talk talk is useless for people that like to record programmes and watch at leisure you cannot record,Bad
1265,due to have a full package installed today bt engineer went to the wrong address a good few miles away then when he eventually turned up he said he could not go up ladders in the dark or do the outside wiring also said he knew nothing about the tv package it was not his remit after a long conversation and being put through to a call centre in india was told to rearrange that part of course they did not care that i had taken a full day from work to be at the property and that next week i am due to have an operation after which i cannot drive so my husband now has to take a day off work back to the engineer he carried out some installation for the line and broadband but not the phone line from which it works i am now hanging on the phone to someone who no doubt will eventually put me through to india once again i think this is the and worst customer service i have ever had from anybody why go to bt i wish i had not,Bad
1266,really bad service looking to cancel,Bad
1267,customer service is really poor takes ages to get through and not helpful at is absolute rubbish router is absolute rubbish and as soon as my contracts up ill be leaving,Bad
1268,so disappointed i chose to stay with vodafone when my yr contract ran out swapping over to a sim only deal should have been such a simple process but due to incompetence and ineptitude of vodafone i will be without a phone line for hrs and have been off with platitudes and lies from a range of lovely sounding people who have promised me all manner of assistance but have failed to deliver even a modicum of customer satisfaction it has gotten to the stage that i cannot believe anything the representatives are telling me as i have become so disillusioned with the brand they will still expect me to pay in a couple of days for a service theyre not providing which in my opinion is tantamount to dishonest appropriation absolutely poor service shame on you vodafone,Bad
1269,they make life way to complicated try and wear you down into submission on simple things only they are right when they are clearly wrong does life have to be this difficult others manage customer care why is vodafone so very poor at finally after weeks many hours on the phone lost documents by vodafone visit to shop vodafone admitted there is an error and the goodwill compensation payment offered was approx hour of my time really goodwill payments should be well goodwill,Bad
1270,my first experience with ee ended with them paying me compensation after i took my complaints to highly recommended service about months ago i found myself in urgent need of a new phone so bought a secondhand iphone locked to ee yeah i should have known better but i was doing a friend a favour too only ever used said phone on pay as you go and sold it in march last year moving back to android and today i get a bill from ee for outstanding balance there is no explanation how this charge has been incurred or when it dates from needless to say i will not paying it and i heartily advise anyone else to avoid this bunch of incompetent charlatans at any cost,Bad
1271,very good until you have an issue which has been regularly over the last few years intermittent connection slow connection and then when you try to contact them to come to a resolution their website just takes you round in circles you wont get anywhere the phone lines are too busy and if you do manage to get through to someone they will find every opportunity to tell you there is nothing wrong with their service and they have the best service around you just need to look online at all of the people reporting issue to know that vm are liars their broadband is fast when it works but youre paying more than you would anywhere else so youd expect it to be,Bad
1272,i am rating this star as no option for zero stars or better negative star rating have been with virgin for over years now had issues with there broadband signal all the time but most recently trying to contact to get it sorted has been a nightmare called through and having to wait for the automated system to do there checks and having to call back straight away as it does nothing to sort signal when you get through to what that call a customer service advisor you get all the same questions could it be your wifi signal not the broadband try telling them your plugged in through ethernet cable they do not listen they are judgemental and god forbid you ask to speak to a manager got hung up on twice today and am still waiting hours later for the call back in hours if you are thinking of signing up dont if you are with them already leave thought sky was bad but they are a close second to these cowboys,Bad
1273,appalling the worst company i think i have ever dealt with branson obviously doesnt care about quality or monitor this business terrible broadband service drops every day making it impossible to hold calls and only reaches a few feet from the router the product is terrible but the customer service is even worse passed around the world from one incompetent person to the next after people i was transferred to one in faults who confirmed my bb had disconnected times and would share with colleague in cust services as a reason to cancel the cs person knew nothing about the issue but kept telling me they would help me by cancelling and charging early redemption fees that was after hours and another hour the week before raised a complaint they called the next day but hung up after rings before i could get to the phone their way of reducing the complaints i guess the worst they have called me twice today in response to my complaints but let the phone ring only once before hanging up then sent an email saying they tried to call but i didnt answer so call the customers services number again that i have spent hours on this last week deliberate tactic to avoid handling customer issues shocking from the virgin brand terrible terrible company,Bad
1274,all i want from this company is to do what they say theyll do i want them to repay some money for overpaid line rental which they have agreed to do but simply wont make the repayment whenever i phone i try to speak to a supervisor but cant get past the front line people who are always polite and full of apologies and always tell me someone will phone back in hours they never do this has been going on for three months what amounts to a simple transaction on their part has resulted in hours of wasted time simply trying to talk to someone who will actually do what they say theyll do i have now written a formal complaint to their customer services director requiring my repayment to be made immediately and also claiming compensation for all the wasted time on the phone to them next step is the ombudsman come on bt surely you can do better than this just look at all the bad reviews on this site that should give you a clue that youve clearly got a broken business model but you seem to be doing absolutely nothing to fix it,Bad
1275,where to begin unreliable internet for several years virgin hub resets and wipes set up data recently internet access drops out for most of the day returning at night for a few hours a technician visits early morning when internet is up leaves its down again ten minutes after hes left three long calls to india multiple posts to the forums this has achieved no one returning the comment that my cable needs replacing and that i should wait six weeks no actual date the interim ive been given gold stars for posting fuming rants on their useless cap it all i received a mail noting that something was wrong with my account details and if i didnt rectify the problem in two days id be cut off so thats a best case scenario of eight weeks to get my internet access working two days for me to rush my payment to exhibit all the classic symptoms of a distributed organisation where no one has responsibility for sorting your problem out so no one does no one listens in detail to anything you say my internet is down usually from am to about pm so the one time the technician turned up he arrived just after am and was gone ten minutes before it went down for the next fourteen would plead with anyone to never deal with this company ever this review option really needed a no star,Bad
1276,worst worst worst network i have ever seen in my life i will not recommend any one or continue service with ee my iphone was broken so i had claim it like couple of months ago and they told me charge for it after ee didnt took the payment from my account or no call or not even email or message for payment but last week i have reviewed a mail from moorcroft group who is debt recovery limited ee didnt inform me for any payment or no call and direct this debt company contact me and asking me for i will not recommend any one to join ee network i try to call ee and went to shop but no one help me zero star to went to ee shop and the manager didnt help me out can you please call have my account and there is my number or you can email me on and please add gmail,Bad
1277,from my original start date having just moved home ive miss my password my fault and still after years can not access virgin store no one from virgin seem to be able to sort it out,Bad
1278,absolutely the worst internet provider west of ural mountains north of mediterranean sea,Bad
1279,wifi is ok when it works but when it doesnt work their service is appalling impossible to reach via phone very slow and unhelpful via chat,Bad
1280,worst company on care about customers make it impossible to close account for your own good avoid at all costs,Bad
1281,having read the reviews i should have checked before signing updo not use talktalk you will regret it there customer service does not speak and cannot communicate in basic english and there technical support goes through to the under s school creche as they are beyond incompetent how can you be on a technical line when you know nothing of the clear as cheap is not the best option,Bad
1282,been a t mobile phone ee customer for almost yrs years they have been ok til the time i renewed my last contract gave me the bs sales crap that my phone signal is boosted because long term loyal customer its as bad as voda phone an that is saying something the reason i left voda phone is the same reason im leaving ee poor signal rare it works everywhere even in the city where i live useless chocolate is as much use as my useless phone many thanks for the reply however i dont do twitter or facebook i have contacted ee for help advice which involves going into the city to an ee store i dont have the time i work days a wk real world conditions so feb contract is up and i move not falling for more bs sales lip service oh and to make matters worse they put the price plan up because office of national said the economy is booming lol what a salt rub way to go ee just been reading an interesting article about ee roaming speeds abroad been only mbps compared to competitors mbps however im starting to think mine is deliberately slow here in uk also wake up ee stop ripping us off,Bad
1283,my wifi off times without correspondence so i emailed their customer service team to complain and cancel the contract and theyre trying to make me pay for the rest of the term i think consumer rights may say otherwise,Bad
1284,prior to today virgin were my internet provider of choice for over years and i would have been happy to recommend them not after could understand the price increases after my contract ended and understand i agreed to giving days notice which i attempted to today that was all when i attempted to give that notice today i was twice hung up on by cancellation agents mid conversation after long waits in queues and on hold the frontline cs were friendly and polite though neither of which made any attempt to call me back or acknowledge my request to serve then took nearly hours dealing with raising a complaint and still chasing my notice only for them to still try retain me with scripted and impersonal pitches completely oblivious to what i was stating or acknowledging the previous experiences that i had feel sorry for the advisors who were only trying to maintain their daily kpis but as a company it was a terrible experience and waste of a this i still havent had my notice accepted,Bad
1285,the worst telephone company in uk specially for business last few months we are facing issues with broad band and whenever phone them to complain every time same answer and same method i am paying the bills as agreed but not getting service as promised just imaging a software company without internet but talktalk does not care good bye talktalk for goods,Bad
1286,i was told when we renewed our contract that they were putting a complaint in about the quality of our internet and i never heard back then i got an email saying that you had checked the internet speed for days and it was ok on those days the internet was hardly used and it doesnt take into consideration the signal on other parts of the house,Bad
1287,i had weeks to find a company after leaving sky i ordered talk talk fibre i got a order id with a installation date days later no email went on chat and different people couldnt find order i gave them benefit of doubt and tried again days i received order number i even received top cashback and yet no email or text so spent an hour on the chat being told again by different people no order disgrace,Bad
1288,logging in to my vodafone is a exercise you can either log in or you get a web page saying something exciting is coming for app doesnt recognise my phone number has been with vodafone for at least five years and then two years ago i was transferred to on a have been trying to get the date my contract ends so that i can leave this awful service provider an oxymoron if ever i heard online accounts and mobile phone apps so that we dont have to hold for hours on a call when these dont work we are left with the only option of talking to a when they say to go to the nearest am going to try their tomorrow and will come back to add the outcome not going to hold my breath for a working resolution to the issue hours on and got through to a vodafone partner a helpful customer service operator listened to what i had to say a bit of a rant helped me with my queries and gave me a customer service number which will give me an option to get straight through to getting my account cancelled expensive she could not however help me with my app not recognising my phone or the problems with the online have been satisfied with my coverage and the actual phone use so decisions decisions do i pay the approximately to cancel the contract or carry on dealing with the shortcomings of my technical shortcomings until june,Bad
1289,o stars should be i took years mobile contract phone suddenly stopped working after years all i got is pay remaining pounds and upgrade like they dont care after years of being customer goodbye o,Bad
1290,i was not able to speak with sent an email responding to my feed back there was no opportunity to respond i am responding through edit i tried the avenues you mention set out on your website to speak to someone and all lead to a recorded message that was of no help at all you need to review your customer service as a result of my appalling experience this morning i have cancelled my contract please confirm that you have process this talk talk reference,Bad
1291,this shower of hite have just caused my mate to take an overdose now is ill the last five months they have been trying to sort out a billing issue they left in april hours on the phone to the morons messages on the community board and today finally a person was sorting out the they cut the left a voicemail asking to call back the info would be with the next person who took the call wrong they were not interested nowhere was got to very call was made to talktalk again the whole story was given again the moron then just put the call through to a department without telling that was what they were doing then the person in that department said they were not the department to help said that it was customer services who had to deal with the problem customer services were the ones who put him through to the have breached the data protection act during this last few days by exposing another customers finances with talktalk who took the phone number over after my mate left they recycled it but it is still required to be used by the old customer my mate to get into his account to make any payment the web site account never worked thats why he recorded todays calls with all the shenanigans talktalk admitting their fault with the action is on its way talk talk yes you lot with no sense sense,Bad
1292,absolutely shocking service the people behind the desk are polite enough but the misinformation and poor communication is appalling i had no internet for weeks they kept delaying the start date but didnt inform me i was told over the phone it would be the th so i took a day off work no show no call no email i contacted them they told me it would be the th once again no show no call no email i checked my account online and the date changed to the th so i spoke to bt and said theyd have it sorted within a week talk talk should go in the bin,Bad
1293,i would never recommend vodafone to anyone the service is poor for both calling and data,Bad
1294,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
1295,seriously dont go near this useless company i tried to get a fibre connection from them and first they cancelled my previous provider before they managed to connect me to vodafone then when the engineers arrived to connect the fibre cable they said they would have to dig up the middle of my new drive to lay the cable when i said this cant happen they said ok we will come back next week to lay the cable avoiding ruining my a week without broadband different engineers arrived and also wanted to dig up my drive i explained to them that they should lay the cable along the pavement then along my fence hence avoiding any damage to the drive they said they couldnt do this and contacted vodafone again and asked if they could supply a dongle to tide me over until i can get connected they told me they would send one the next day but after days no decided to contact the company that lay the fibre cables along the pavement to the connection box which is called a tobi box the person i spoke to confirmed thet it would have been easy to reroute the fibre cable to my days without broadband and speaking to different call centre people who all reassured me they could fix this problem i told them i would have to cancel this contract they said ok as a goodwill gesture they would give me for my troubles but no didnt send look elsewhere for your broadband to avoid these,Bad
1296,i would give them less than star if i could shocking company charging me an extra for data that i havent used was told the first time i got in touch with them it was a mistake then was told no it wasnt and that i owed the total of for my monthly bill shocking service cant wait to did as you asked and sent a message via facebook no response nothing at all from you a waste of time and money roll on may when i can change companies,Bad
1297,worst internet provider i have ever used i had decided to use virgin media because they promised me fast speeds i was absolutely stressed with the wifi speeds severely unreliable i could not even hold a zoom meeting the speeds should have been able to support devices and i could not even support device avoid at all costs otherwise you will be on call for hours with customer service for them to just tell you there is nothing they can do trust me from a person who has spoken to multiple friends and families with virgin accounts they have said it is unreliable the only good thing was a sim they provided with data which ultimately had no issues,Bad
1298,customer services dont know what they are doing their answer to everything is to transfer to another department leave you in hold and call disconnects bills dont make sense constant over charges broadband dont work properly then told got to pay extra per month for booster issue with outage in area from when i joined for over month and told credit for disruption automatically applied on account bloody liars i dont know anyone in my area that i know are on virgin that received the credit customer services overseas is diabolical they literally laugh at you offered months free sky sports which i ended they have not reverted bills back to original contract price but increased it virgin was the best at one time but now they are crap avoid at all costs i will be arguing early termination of contract subject to no early termination fees as they are clearly in breach of consumer law i only gave mark as if there was i would give it that,Bad
1299,ive been with o for about years but the last couple of years theyve gone so downhill its impossible to contact them and they force you to look up your query online and most of the time the answer isnt there they charge you for random things put up your contract half way through and make leaving them or getting help super hard i have ended my contract early and paid the difference i wanted to leave so much,Bad
1300,i still do not have broadband connection upstairs after continuously informing vm,Bad
1301,ive been a vodafone customer for well over years and i have just suffered some of the most chaotic and disjointed service ever last thursday i got back from a camping holiday and noticed that somehow my mobile had become accidentally damaged and was not on friday i went into my local vodafone store the shop assistant i spoke with was not very helpful however she did tell me that i could claim insurance and incur a excess fee and my phone would be sent off and hopefully returned within working days which she could assist me with or i could pay for an upgrade which she couldnt help me with i had a few months left on my contract so before i could decide on the insurance vs upgrade route i needed to know how much it would cost to buy out my current contract so i went home and called the upgrade number the guy was actually helpful he is making a sale after all he told me the cost to buy out my contract which was less than the insurance excess fee so it was a no brainer i chose a make and model and confirmed service package he said that my new phone would be with me on monday just before midday i received an automated email from vodafone saying they were still waiting for stock from the manufacturer and that i was on the waiting list but gave no clarity about when i would receive my phonei contacted vodafone chat they dont have an upgrade option for topics to chat about so i ended up talking to a tech support guy who tried to be helpful but couldnt really help me so i rang the upgrade team they dont care once they have made the sale so they passed me onto customer the cs guy told me he was going to cancel the order and i should ring back in days time to reorder the phone i said this was unacceptable then he said i can go into my local store and pick it up from there and that he would make a note on my account to this i went back to the store to be told by the assistant manager that the cs guy should not have said this because they did not have any stock of this model in store he said i had to ring cs back i got rather annoyed at this point and asked why vodafone is making this my problem so he volunteered to ring cs he spoke with someone who said that my phone would now be delivered on im not holding my experience has told me the following systems appear to be chaotic and disjointed dont put too much stock on anything a vodafone employee tells you simply because internal communication conduits appear to be so inefficient maybe its time i reassessed my long standing loyalty to it is now wednesday evening and there is no sign of my phone funny that i did receive a response from vodafone who just told me to contact the social media team on facebook which i have done it seems the vodafone model is that whenever something goes wrong the customer is the one who has to do all the work to try to resolve the issue anyway days later and i am no closer to receiving my new pmwell i have just called vodafone customer services and have been told that their systems are down and they dont know when they will be back again i was told to call back tomorrow it goes from bad to pmwell i have heard back from the social media team they said they would inform me of progress via text my phone is broken they also told me to check the tracker the tracker has shown the same status order accepted confirmation since friday night finally they suggested i contact vodafone chat well i did that on monday and they cant tell you any more than what they can see in the tracker again why cant vodafone actually take responsibility for this issue and resolve amthe saga in response to my less than favourable assessment of suggested resolution above vodafone sent me a link to forum vodafone so i had to fill in an online form and send it off i got an automatic reply saying that in most cases they will answer my email in hours i rang again the first guy said they were still waiting for delivery from the manufacturer then he transfered me to someone else who put me on hold and managed to cut me off then i called back and had to tell it all to someone else he rang the warehouse and confirmed that a shipment is due today at noon and that dispatch should happen tomorrow or monday at the latest i asked him to call me back to confirm this and he said he would call me on my landline at circa pmwell i received an email from forum vodafone saying they had been trying to call me but it went to voicemail they have sent me a digit code by text and need me to verify this in order for them to look into this issue i replied by email to say that my mobile is broken so i cant send or receive calls or texts i have to say it reminds me of the monty python dead parrot those of you who want a laugh its on just received this message from very sorry your order still isnt in stock yet rest assured were working closely with the manufacturer to get your items to you as quickly as we can and well keep you updated with our progress well be back in touch with another update in four days even sooner if stock arrives in the who do i believe this automated message or the cs representative i spoke with this well the cs representative didnt call me last night as promised however i received a call from the social media cs complaint resolution team this morning the best resolution that vodafone can offer me is to cancel my upgrade order which will take hours after which i have to call them back and place a new that is what vodafone calls customer service or complaint resolution i am quite frankly had an absolute of vodafone ive had enough so i have cancelled my upgrade and am terminating my account but here is the kicker if you upgrade your phone while you are still in contract you pay what i assume is the remaining fixed costs ie the outstanding balance on the cost of the handset however if you terminate the account while you are still in contract they charge you fixed and variable costs the variable costs include the costs for calls texts data that you will obviously never use so vodafone provide appalling customer service and get to charge punitive fees im so fed up ive paid it so i am waiting for my upgrade order to be cancelled so i can get my porting authorisation code pac i have been told it takes hours for the upgrade order to be pmi rang the vodafone cs number on saturday to see if my order had been cancelled i was told the back office dont work weekends and to call back on pm on monday i received the following automated due to exceptionally high demand the manufacturer still hasnt been able to send us stock for your order were sorry for the continued delay well be in touch in ten days with a further update hopefully sooner if stock arrives in the points to are they sending me these if they are supposed to be processing my they originally promised me delivery the next working day going by this latest message this has now blown out to working rang cs again who called the orders team who promised me that the order would be cancelled by pmhave called vodafone my order has not been cancelled and they are not able to verify status so this is now over working days and four phone calls have told me i have to call back later pmi spoke with a cs agent who told me i cant cancel a live upgrade order and i have to wait until i receive the handset before i can cancel it this is the first time i have heard this and contradicts the formal advice from vodafone cancel the current order and ring back days later to place a new one the bloke then cut me off while transfering mei rang back and spoke with a helpful cs agent who confirmed that my order was then rang the number to get my pac to find it was discontinued so had to ring the cs team back i spoke with another helpful cs agent who gave me my pac over the phone and sent me an automatic email about pac and leaving it included the following for your recent pac request were very sorry to hear youre planning on leaving vodafone if youve decided to switch because of something we did wrong let us put things right just get in touch to talk about your options wed like to do all we can to keep you with well it is a bit too late for this has become the longest review i have ever written on trustpilot i could have just written a summary however if i had written a comment like i have just received chaotic and disjointed service from vodafone it would not have given anything close to an impression of the vodafone customer service experience the hours of wasted time the days of waiting the misinformation the chaotic and shambolic service the disjointed and misaligned internal processes systems that crash and with the exception of a few cs representatives who are doing their best in trying circumstances a customer service culture that gives the distinct impression that they really dont care,Bad
1302,we escaped from bt to zen years ago and generally their service has been excellent customer and technical support is uk based and they even answer the phone recently however broadband service delivery has deteriorated dramatically i note one long review below lambasting approach to resolving technical problems and i can confirm all of that i am an experienced customer with several accounts we all know that these companies are hamstrung by the network and that they cannot work instant magic to resolve service outages recently though zen have become unacceptably patronising and frankly reluctant to authorise an engineer to attend despite all the usual threats to charge if an engineer attends and no fault is found i suspect there is some financial reason zen prefer to waste hours of my time on the phone before sending the engineer i dont know but what i can report is that zen are not what they were possibly a victim of their own success there are other smaller keener companies out there now and we are gradually moving our broadband and telephone accounts over to one in particular with very satisfactory results zen its too late to keep us but wake up and remember where you came from for the sake of others,Bad
1303,used my mobile phone abroad for a few minutes following that i have been charged a fee of five times minutes over and my phone has been locked have not bee able to make a phone call for several days have called customer service for hours and have sent several emails but have not had a reply need my phone for work and it has bee a nightmare have never experience such an appalling service will have to go to the bank get my money back and change contract tomorrow appalling service,Bad

1306,if i could rate it i would first of all they wouldnt let me fit the wifi box myself all other companies did thats fine not a problem but then the only available engineer appointment is in nearly weeks time we waited it out as gb or data sound enticing roll on the date and they didnt turn up called virgin and they said he did which cctv says to book another appointment and they said to wait another weeks i think not considering it was a error on their recommend they dont provide what they say they do and they arent helpful in the slightest,Bad
1307,i tried to sign up for a social tariff and had to wait days to be contacted only to be told its not available in my area pretty useless and a bit annoyed i had to wait days to be told this when i could have tried elsewhere now i have to wait up to days for this other company to reply im sure the social tariff is a scam or deliberately made difficult to make you pay for a normal package im glad i saw the reviews here too before it went any further with anyway,Bad

1309,good company only when you are paying them when you want to leave or just stop after a year faultless contract then this is where the trouble year contract was paid every month bang on time without fault then after the years i just wanted a few months time for a break but no ee kept on trying to get me to have a new phone despite the one i had being still perfectly fine for another years they then tried and tried to get me on a contract again i refused telling them i just want a i got through to uk staff and it was all resolved in minutes but ee then in spite cancelled all my online accounts deleting my main account so i couldnt go back months fine okay i will find another company when i want to go back to a mobile remember they are good when you are a paying customer but the moment you want out even after the contract expires they show their true colours,Bad
1310,the most unsteady network and terrible customer service the network often disconnects where i am located for the entire building and it takes a long period of time to be restored and when it does customer service is utterly unhelpful and offers no ways of remedying our experience,Bad
1311,they enticed me to sign a month fibre contract package with a promise of amazon vouchers which would be sent out to be days after signing up lo and behold days passed and no voucher called tt and was told there was no such offer and i needed to provide proof of the offer went online and googled the talk talk forum where hundreds of people have complained about the exact same issue also there bb is terrible as i get less than mbps on a mbps fibre package go figure have to reset router at least times everyday videos keep buffering and go grainy midway during netflix cannot watch videos on p on a mbps fibre package just save your money and go with bt or ee,Bad
1312,i was at the end of my contract and wanted to leave virgin media i phoned up which took a long time to get through and was put around different departments they then offered a deal and i said i wanted to think about it it was then automatically put the deal onto my package without my permission tying me in to another months i tried to cancel it in the cooling off period and they lied and said i still had months left of my original so i might as well keep the deal once i realised it was a lie and my contract was up the next month they said they couldnt do anything about the new deal unless i disconnected on the day really untrustworthy and shockingly slow service this all took about and hours of time and now im stuck with them again,Bad
1313,i have wasted over hours of my life over the past months just trying to get my internet to work properly i am being moved from one person to the next all asking the same questions over and over again with no change at all and no results to show for it,Bad

1315,not able to give stars i called talk talk and ask for a new number they transfer my mobile to o then talk talk charge me an extra months bill when i dont even have one of their mobiles,Bad
1316,worst coverage of any mobile company zero coverage in the town of somerset unless you hang out an upstairs coverage in mid somerset appalling despite coverage maps showing otherwise not to be complaining they are not interested and just point to the maps which are not just as expected pointless reply asking to waste more time reporting the same issue only to be told the map says coverage is good post code is if you really want to help use this info and resolve the issue or update your map,Bad
1317,overpriced cheaper reliable alternatives are available,Bad
1318,no loyalty they previously changed my contract and with that removed my agreed discount for going in contract with them then kept increasing their prices i have gone in store and was confirmed by their employee they wont do anything and confirmed as well it will be cheaper for me to leave ee and then come back as a new customer how ridiculous is that,Bad
1319,i ordered a free payg sim card it came quickly but there was no telephone number it is not possible to top up the card and take advantage of the offer because a telephone number is enough i dont feel like calling and waiting for the helpline for me it is not worth it and time wasted hopes for the use of o came to naught not to mention harassing me with phone calls before getting my card,Bad
1320,i have an iphone that connects to all other networks except talktalk with whom i have a contract it used to connect perfectly i have spent many hours online in lockdown discussing the issue with apple and have had two visits to the apple shop in plymouth and now apple conclude it is a talktalk router problem the iphone connects to wifi in the apple shop and in a friends home who has bt as a provider having used the chat system for hours today with talktalk the operative said she would have to shut down wifi on my computer and continue with chat on the iphone at which time i have decided to leave talktalk after many years and incur a penalty charge disgraceful conduct by such a large organisation,Bad
1321,signed up to bt package which we thought was a good price a month for movies fiber and evening and weekend calls for month contract after a few months we are paying almost double around a month ok so we been paying it us thinking we must be over our contract and were looking into some cheaper deals we then had a call from bt stating that we are paying far too much so i told him k so do us a good deal he them tapped a few buttons and then told us oh sorry your still in your contract nothing we can do til september call us then and we will see what we can do anyway moral f this review dont be fooled by their low price deals and u will have to pay full price within a few months apparently they have the right to increase the prices whenever they like we will be joining sky when our contract is up full package tv with movies and sports music and kids plus fiber cheaper than bt cowboys,Bad
1322,phoned the tech service as i was having weak signal with my mobile data guy on phone told me to go into settings and make some alterations and he will then call me straight back no call back and the alterations made my phone alot worse why tell customers you will call them straight back and then you dont shocking service,Bad
1323,i purchased a oneplus online payg what an awful experience firstly i was told in store by the sales representative that this phone is locked to the network his way of selling me a contract but truthfully these are sim free phones im with vodafone so dont need a new plan but are the only in store retailer for this phone in the querying this matter further with an online sales representative on website he said that the sales the colleague in the shop was wrong and the phone is sim free so i proceed with the order then happily take my then have the good grace to not email me a receipt for my purchase or notify me at all for that matter if i had not screen shot my reference number there would be no proof of the sale and i would be out of pocket i figured it would be similar to purchasing something off amazon i was to make the experience even worse no one from the store woking branch bothered to notify me that my phone is ready for collection i had to call them to check the status of my order i only found out from the courier the expected time of arrival and i didnt get an apology or explanation as to why i was not informed overall the most shocking customer experience is a lot of money for a one off purchase i should have just bought direct from the supplier but because have a face and people you can talk to i thought i was in safe hands i will be staying clear of in the future,Bad
1324,despite being promised internet speeds of meg this has just not been delivered yes there are occasions if you stand right next to the router you might for short periods get this speed but it can and does drop out down to below meg every night the tv will freeze and there are rooms in the house where there is just no signal at all and our devices have to switch to were warned before we moved into this property that the quality of the internet provided by virgin was poor and i wished we had on our experience to date i would not recommend virgin however perhaps there is someone from virgin who reads these reviews and will take some action to restore our faith in what they are advertising,Bad
1325,just tried speaking to their tech support who refused to acknowledge any part of the problem being responsibility and then cut my internet connection to end the chat,Bad
1326,ive been with you day one and my internet doesnt tried to find out through live chat with and for an hour waiting for replies which was literally just asking for my details i got no where for some reason you decided to cut off the chat,Bad
1327,since ive renewed my packed the wifi and tv has decreased in performance immensely the wifi has reduced in speed rather than increasing as promised since hubs this is causing major interruption into our daily lives as we are currently still working from homei would appreciate a phone call regarding this as ive head from several sources of a decreased service once you have renewed with virgin,Bad
1328,never going with talk talk again they might be cheap but their customer service is the worst ive ever experienced in any sector my internet speeds arent what they guaranteed when i signed up to talk talk so trying to speak to customer service to improve but literally go round in circles they leave no history on your account from previous conversations which means youre left repeating yourself constantly with nothing happening over the past days i have been on chat for over hours and nothing worthwhile has happened and my internet speed still as poor as it was its not even the poor speeds that have annoyed me its the poor response from customer service if i had seen some real actions and response to try and fix my internet speed i would be a happier mani will never make the mistake of going with talk talk again,Bad
1329,i have always been with o and decided to upgrade with them to an iphone i purchased insurance and a phone case from them at the same time when my new phone arrived i decided that i was not happy with the phone and sent it back along with the phone case and cancelled the insurance all on the same day i hadnt even opened the cases it was all still brand new i also contact o explaining that i had sent everything back and was reassured that i would not be charged any additional costs that month given the items were received back to o which they were i then contacted o after checking my phone balance online i was again reassured that this was an error on os behalf and that i wont be charged for the month on july however i would be charged double in august i agreed to this after checking my account on the th august i noticed that o despite agreeing not to had in fact charged me the incorrect balance in july despite promising me that i would not be charged for their mistake i instantly contacted on the th august who apologised and arranged for a full refund i also received a text from o explaining that amount of will reach my bank account working days from the th it did the nd august days after os promise to refund my account for money that i was incorrectly billed for i had still not been refunded i contacted o again and was advised that the refund had only reached my o account not my bank account where it should have been put back my august bill had also been taken out of the due to this my o account balance is o support advised me that they can only refund this amount directly into my account now which is very annoying i also have to wait another working days and we have a bank holiday during this time this means i have to wait working days and have had to contact o to tell them how to do their job on several occasions in order to get money refunded to me which i was charged for by error of o very disappointing from o i have no trust in them i do not believe they care about inconveniencing their customers which is sad as i have been a loyal user of o for years the taken from my account caused me a lot of issues with regards to bank charges and o were not at all regretful of sorry for their am now looking for another network to join as i have had even further issues separate to this regarding my data allowance which was apparently doubled recently given my new plan yet my data seems to have decreased,Bad
1330,replaced a standard broadband with fibre scheduled to start midnight on th apr all good then at noon on th the landline stopped working numerous phone calls from my mobile got no response just the line that is has been reported to open reach who appear to me to be a law onto themselves and answer to no one seems this in lasts for hours but it was ok before so open reach have caused it no excuses are acceptable just very poor service from ee and open reach it has been documented many time but no one cares typical,Bad
1331,after over an hour on the phone trying to cancel my broadband i was out on hold times and pushed to different teams to then eventually be told its not possible to cancel and i would need to call is the end result of having made complaints of drop out of service line issues and bandwidth not once have i been contacted back nor has a single thing been am not not even able to cancel and leave never mind the fine i will receive for doing utterly disgusting the worst customer service i have ever received unable to even get out of it,Bad
1332,basically put my package up to pound without informing me until i was checking my bank account i much they were taking plus i only have fibre optic no tv package absolutely rip off,Bad
1333,absolutely abysmal offered fibre broadband a surveyor said it was possible for it to be installed then after weeks of waiting said it was not possible then offered me half fibre for almost the same price and took away a free gift package of an alexa because i wasnt getting fibre that originally they said i could get then i phoned up and they hung up no call back,Bad
1334,absolutely rubbish service had problems from the start with internet around our house virgins excuse is that i have brick walls and they can not guarantee signal every time i call up they just waste time repeatedly saying the same thing and will not let you leave your contact early very poor product and service,Bad
1335,virgin media lies your engineer left us without online reps had no idea how to fix our fault they suggested sending out another engineer in days time we said that was not acceptable we asked to speak to a manager we couldnt because they were in a meeting but would definitely ring us call back as promised if a virgin media manager doesnt care theres no company from top to bottom,Bad
1336,ive consistently been happy with the product but their customer service is abysmal contact their cs about changing my deal at the end of contract and i spent an entire day going back and forth with them to arrange told the new contract will be emailed to me within hours it doesnt then i get an email charging me for the more expensive contract that i hadnt agreed to contact cs again they inform me that despite the charge not going through for another days theyll still be charging me this amount and will take money off my bill the next month instead i inform them this is unacceptable i didnt agree to pay more this month and wasnt informed of it and as their mistake they should fix i raise a formal complaint with the cs agent two mins after ending the conversation i get an email informing me my complaint has been closed im now contacting them again trying to fix another one of their mistakes the cs agents are clearly working with an entirely copy and pasted script and issues often have to be reiterated multiple times i shouldnt have to contact them this many times for them to resolve numerous issues from their own side its a shame as ive had great experiences with their product but their customer service is dreadful,Bad
1337,i must admit as a young professional man vodafone alone have managed to completely destroy any respect or faith i once had for this company speaking as a shareholder of vodafone group plc i have had to deal with incompetent rude and disrespectful staff from vodafone i would like to say it was limited to a single member of staff but it is not i can only assume there is an establishment type issue within the corporation especially amongst the customer service team examples of this can be investigated into the recorded phone calls the issues are not limited to the customer service as the reason for my complaint stems from a technical issue on vodafone side perhaps lack on investment or incompetence or both my reason for the initial contact with customer services was to enquire why a which was on my account had been withdrawn as my bills had doubled i was informed my contract had finished by october this year and therefore the discount had been removed i explained that in september a new deal had been negotiated and a discount would be applied to my account for months as a result of staff incompetence and honouring what i was told for your information at that particular period of time vodafone offered me a very good deal and then decided to not offer me that particular deal as they had made an error on there side i was told they could not offer that particular deal as it was not part of there standard packages however as the deal was offered they reluctantly decided to honour it i had tremendous trouble at the time dealing with vodafone and it was a particularly unpleasant experience however in the end it was settled and the deal would be offered for months at a discount the above can be verified with the notes on my file and recorded telephone conversations this brings us forward to today when i noticed a few weeks ago my bill had doubled and the discount had been removed this involved speaking with customer services i was passed from pillar to post and then when someone did decide to listen i was told my contract began in oct and finished in oct hence the removal of the discount when i mentioned what had happened in september i got a response of that there is no evidence of that and i cannot help you any further as you can understand trying to communicate my situation was very infuriating as the customer services screen had no mention of my september contract as a result of this i was spoken to very badly and disrespectfully on one occasion the customer service member response to my issue was that i did not have a leg to stand on and i should upgrade this completely undermined my call and issue i politely refused her ludicrous offer and was adamant not to be transferred to the upgrades team she denied my request and did the opposite and transferred me i could not believe what had happened after spending an hour explaining the issue vodafone had caused me this was how it was dealt with fortunately i explained to someone in the upgrades team what had happened and he had the knowledge and time to listen to me and help and agreed that he would make a complaint towards the member of staff as it was completely unacceptable furthermore the upgrades staff managed to workout what had happened he explained that there was a system transfer and that the issue had occurred as not all the information had transferred from one system to another he with myself and explained that i was correct and a had been applied in september for months i believes the error occurred because the discount was applied manually in september as it was not a standard tariff at this point i thought this nightmare was over and all could be resolved as it became clear what had happened he gave me specific dates when the contract commenced and everything tallied up we concluded that a request had to be put in for this to be changed back as it could not be done immediately and would take some time i was told i would receive a with confirmation from this within or days from the th november no was received and i called back today unfortunately when i called back i was put through to customer services to cut this short the hour conversation i had with the lady was similar to that of the customer service member i had dealt with before she was offering me no solution and told me the request had been denied and there was nothing else i could do she had an extremely bad attitude and very disrespectful i had to endure her disrespect for me and constant and hissing she threatened to hang up on me and then put me on hold for circa minutes with little warning hoping i would hang up in the mean time when she realised i would not hang up as she knows the conversations are recorded she hanged up on me not only is this unacceptable my issue still remains unresolved and i reverted to writing this email on the advice of going to a vodafone store and explained what happened after the conversation i am in absolute despair and i cant believe someone can be treated like this not only have i lost half my day today dealing with this i have been financially penalised for being overcharged,Bad
1338,internet rarely works and drops out all the time engineers not interested leaving as soon as contract runs out,Bad
1339,if i could rate this zero i almost been in a chat conversation for hours trying to either get them to match a new customer deal or cancel my account so i can move to another provider it initially took about hour to get through to a human after a lot of back and forth with their useless chatbot then because that person couldnt really help i had to wait for another mins hours in im finally in contact with someone who is now telling me to call a number to cancel my service with will be switching because as a long term customer im paying a month for m broadband and phone a new customer can get this for almost cheaper another example of how a company will treat customer loyalty with total disrespect and rip off those who have been with them for many years it is a shame that we have to keep switching to avoid this abuse,Bad
1340,it took numerous letters and phone calls to get my deposit back after changing to bt,Bad
1341,really bad no service at all on the phone for the last hours line cuts off at the end by the time we company i have ever been go round in circles from one department to another still in the queue waiting,Bad
1342,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
1343,o taking direct debits and chasing for money but not ready to take complaint or take action against their fraud partner bmd and help their customers making money by selling sim only monthly business contract to non business customers,Bad
1344,the o service is i cant wait to go with ee in october,Bad
1345,totally useless customer service is shocking on hold for over an hour and they hang up which has happened multiple times when you get threw its like talking to a donkey who passes you on to the next,Bad
1346,just get worse and worse we lost broadband and phone i contacted tech support who said they would send engineer and keep me updated with texts no texts so i called was told van didnt have any wire on board and had to specially order some sounds highly likely that they wouldnt carry such a specialist item as wire with them but be fixed next day and i would be updated by text no texts so i called kept waiting for mins on my mobile to be told no update when i said wasnt happy that it had taken that long to be told no update was passed to a manager who said i would be updated by text no texts so i spent an hour with online help who were actually useful and so after days finally an engineer came who sorted the problem in minutes after realising i had spent over on calls to tech support and received zero help i called number listed as customer support to ask for compensation first thing i asked was is this a free call from talk talk landline was told yes so i continued received some compensation good but was charged for the call called to complain v v rude response from call centre here we go again never left negative review for a company before far far worse than bt which is quite an technical support that waste your time and money and provide no help,Bad
1347,i personally dont find it good value for money its very expensive and the internet is very slow and constantly losing connection so does my box i wouldnt recommend anyone to virgin weve had nothing but problems with ours,Bad
1348,not helpful my relative bought iphone online with gb upfront and when spoke to them first they said they need to charge extra pound i agreed thought plan is still good then ee said no extra charge of pound upfront i thought ok i am still good then ee was like gb for monthly and upfront which was out of order i would not recommend ee to anyone there is no whatsoever good customer service,Bad
1349,my internet connect drops off when my children are working from home the connection of wifi call is confusing by having apps separate apps mobile and my virgin media to check my payments and details,Bad
1350,constant broadband disruption from minute drops a couple of times a week to whole day drops once a customer service they have used coronavirus to drop of their customer service capacity making you wait ages on the phone complaint emails have been completely engineer absolutely wrecked our walls installing the virgin cable chunks of plaster missing holes filled in badly with bathroom sealant i had to tell the engineer to use a stud finder to avoid drilling into metal in the wall as his first attempt was unsuccessful for exactly this reason thankfully for him it wasnt an electrical cable he drilled despite promises that they wouldnt change my contract on moving house they have nearly doubled it to per month and put me on a new contract so here i sit on the phone for an undetermined amount of time trying to correct their an isp who doesnt actively try to provide the most terrible service possible,Bad
1351,internet just casually disappears for few minutes over and over again,Bad
1352,bad signal nsn,Bad
1353,they are simply impossible to get hold of via any type of communication within a reasonable timeframe that it makes me want to switch provider customer service team is slow and cant type sentences that actually make sense in english and my problem apparently wont be looked at for another week which is just laughable they seem to be very speedy when theyre trying to get you as a customer but couldnt care less after that its a shame that the support is just so terrible as the broadband itself is one of the best in terms of download speed for the price just hope you never have to talk to an actual human being that they probably shouldnt have employed to begin with,Bad
1354,endless time on hold to then get cut off sports not been working for two weeks no refunds nothing offered,Bad
1355,it is the slowest wifi in history every time you try and change provider they offer you another package when you finally lose the battle of wills you realise that your paying more for the same crappy wifi you had before,Bad
1356,tried to call to upgrade my service ive been on hold for minutes i thought id try bt and they answered after not even mins on hold well done virgin you just lost a customer,Bad
1357,virgin media is extremely expensive has almost nonexistent customer service it is nearly impossible to get through to customer services or even find the number and the online help pages just repeat the same stuff without any recourse to speaking or chatting to a human being the service while fast is unstable and intermittent with numerous random disconnections and outages every day the technical support once you can get through to it focuses entirely on replacing the hub apparently another department or team deals with the external hardware and they dont seem to do anything at all i suspect the issue may not be localised to my home but rather an issue with aging cables or exchange do not recommend them for broadband use another service and accept the slightly slower speeds because high speeds mean nothing if they keep breaking up,Bad
1358,moved house in december it was supposed to be broadband somehow had intermittent internet connection and no landline this was subsequently fixed by xmas day going through live chat was a nightmare text service contradicted what was on the account call centre agents advised of an appointment and then changed it for the following day as soon as the call ended i was charged a missed appointment fee despite replying within mins to them and then was told to wait for automatic compensation to be given within days guess what today is day and i was left to chase talktalk again when speaking with donna she then tried to say i should be charged for the missed appointment in december despite the matter being closed she said she could only give out or a month free line rental as she doesnt have as authorisation to do more i told her that wasnt good enough as their own policy states per day of activation and days after advising of loss of service she had no idea of this policy after i sent the link to her own website she was then able to provide full compensation and ended the chat i advised she did as such as per the consumer rights act of involving existing legal rights which can include claiming compensation where a trader fails to meet the standards required by the act or under an agreed term of the contract she was pretty taken back by only is their knowledge of their policy and procedure not up to scratch their customer service leaves a lot to be desired and their communication is atrocious,Bad
1359,i canceled my account for everything a while ago i am still being fact more after i cancelled than before i have now been charged again for my i was on line chat to sort it and was asked times for my address which i happily gave but apparently after years of living here and being billed they cant find me how very helpfull thank god i have left talk talk still cant get anything sorted out transfer to any one else is my advise,Bad
1360,i have given up phoning to get my email sorted out i cant view some accounts when i log into they always blame my browser when im sure the problem is with you i have tried with imac and windows machines and their browsers totally hopeless,Bad
1361,unable to answer my query systems down been asked to call in hours not acceptable as talk talk have charged an extraordinary amount this month,Bad
1362,possibly the most unreliable and slowest broadband ive ever had and the worst most frustrating customer service experiences ever in trying to sort it beyond awful do not ever use talk talk i fail to understand why they seem to win any awards,Bad
1363,i have ordered full fibre on the th sept booked an appointment with their engineer on th oct it then started to go wrong i got contacted there was a delay then given an without asking whether i was available contacting talktalk is a nightmare hours on the chat hours on the phone to no result current internet connection with them fibre extremely unstable really no one to sort out the technical fault nor the am so frustrated,Bad
1364,i have been invited to write a review but i am yet to receive my order ive left a note on the for someone to call me to confirm when i may expect my far i cant really give this a positive or a negative rating i may edit this review if i receive a better update as i am presently in order i had a call back and apparently my ps has gone walkabout after waiting a week for it i have to wait for another order to be sent edited to down from edit the return of the edit somehow two separate orders for a ps from bt shop have not been delivered tracking from has never shown any thing beyond asked for a complaint to be raised which so far has also been not sure why anyone would want to order from here this is the worst experience ive had in a long time for online deliveries are the staff just walking off home with my ps lowered from to edit finally arrived today bt shop had to send the ps on separate occasions to deliver it ive left my thoughts with the team via email already,Bad
1365,i had a sim card in an old ipad that has been broken for years due to my personal error i have been paying for it for years without using it i finally decide to cancel and it is proving to be incredibly just cant get to a clear resolution very poor set upi have had my main mobile contract with o and the contrast in service is like night and day i think vodafone do a very poor job of looking at things from the customers perspective to cancel a sim card that has not been used for years is proving to be very difficult surely a phone call would suffice,Bad
1366,after my broadband cost was hiked up over after my introductory offer ended i have been trying to cancel my contract over several daysthe only way to cancel is by contacting them by phone or have called multiple times each time waiting over hour on hold after hour they simply hang up on youthe only resort left to me is to actually write them a this a scam to make it as difficult as possible to cancel their services customer service i have ever received beware of using this company there are much better broadband providers out there,Bad
1367,i have contacted talk talk several times over the last couple of months my first contact and subsequent three were about the lack of access to my email account despite being assured on three occasions that it would be fixed within varied numbers of hours it was not when i rang up and got cross after two weeks of waiting it was fixed within i contacted the company twice to cancel my service as we are moving house i wrote a letter stating when we wanted the service to stop which i asked for a reply to and did not receive one i then phoned saying when we wanted the service to stop but when i got in touch today a week later there was no notification of cancellation on my account this is unbelievable and unacceptable after a letter and a phone call still nothing noted on my account so now i have to stay longer than i wanted because i have to give thirty days notice their service is shockingly bad and nothing seems to change of improve despite them always coming out of customer service surveys badly they are cheap but it is not worth it for the hassle when you need service or help they are useless,Bad
1368,hi so pleased to hear that thanks for your review charlotte talktalk social team,Bad

1372,my original review after signing up was star how i wish i had at virgin media is order was booked at the wrong address even though i said on the phone that she had got it i was told that i couldnt get virgin fibre optic even though access manhole is outside my front door was told that a technician would come and do a site survey on saturday i asked for anyway week day not saturday so was told friday the call was then booked for saturday and they wouldnt change itthe technician said he would move the install date by one day to avoid removal men he didnt change it so install guys threatened to walk off the job because there was no parking due to removal men even though i had told customer services that there would be no i signed up i was assured that i could keep my existing bt phone number so notified every one of this now tell me i cant keep the number no explanation as to complaining about all this but the attitude effectively is tough your signed up now i never signed a contract because it had the wrong address and wrong install date they never sent another contract to me media feel free to respond to this i bet you dont,Bad
1373,i bought it for the p per minute tariff saver international rates i have called before using the phone and they confirm the a strongly believe we should sue this type of business is not accepted anywhere in the world and even if i am losing only a tenner we need to protect ourselves against this scammers no one will protect seems like their actual tariff was p per minute but they never topped up my phone with the i i had a referral that topped up they never gave me the so instead of top up comission i had only bonus when registering my number in their am still waiting their customer service reply,Bad
1374,ok listen dont get me wrong when it bloody works its perfect i get over mbps but damn the amount of issues they have is crazy they always have some sort of and i dont knew why they really need a slap in there faces cause compensation doesnt do anything when the internet has been down for over a week what the hell is a few quid off my bill gonna do they made it worse by extending the by a week thats when i was furious,Bad
1375,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
1376,sold me a faulty phone glue failed and the screen came away from the phone refused to honor warranty they tried to allege i had dropped it when clearly the glue had failed eventually one decent fellow acknowledged that it was failed glue after the rest of his team humiliating me with accusations ignoring the sale of goods act laws but then proceeded to fraudulently obtain cost of repair through deception an offence under section of the fraud act by making a false representation that payment will be refunded and made in full claiming i would be refunded refund never came and they have proven themselves liars and thieves will never go near them for a phone again update finaly got my refund after two months of a wait would they wait months for me to pay my think not calls explaining what had happened to different people in different countries seems there are one or two good employees amongst a sea of unhelpful and useless dead wood,Bad
1377,i ordered a tv as an add on but the tv went astray in transit at the beginning of november as i was going away i cancelled the order and was refunded the deposit i paid ee has now taken the deposit and the first months payment from my bank account a month rang ee and was told they could not refund my money as they had to investigate where the tv isnot my problem as i cancelled the tv but have been inform although they refunded my original deposit i hadnt cancelled the i will now be cancelling my dds with ee as i dont trust them to have access to my bank account anymore,Bad

1381,so far i have been passed from pillar to post having complied with ees request to communicate via facebook in other words i have been totally ignored and ee are relying on inertia they have also deleted my post on their site and all communication following mr smiths request for the contact details of the please please will someone now deal with this,Bad
1382,possibly the most infuriating customer service experience i have endured i rang to check if a online order had been processed as the final step crashed apparently a glitch in the matrix or so the site said so i called and was told nothing was on the system but they could help me however it went from poor to absolute shambles they bumped up the price added activation charges pushed me from pillar to post and they lied to mei was told the css contract summary sheet would reflect the correct price it did not and told just approve it and it will be correct when your first bill is taken on a ever moving first payment date also the links that customer services sent to assist were expired seconds after receiving them or links to setup an account to which no amount of password variables will amount to success the communication is dire there is clearly a willingness to mislead and possibly use a language difference as a excuse in order to swindle cash from a contract says youll pay x amount then if you sign it youll be stuck paying it right if the contracts are worthless then i guess ill sign and pay anything i the call centres back to the uk communication pay the staff properly and remove the need to offer commissions to bolster wages its a poor model in this day and age as the only loser is the customer i and every customer deserve proper service that does not create by its corporate penny pinching design a seemingly neverending infuriating runaround of incompetence where nobody is really accountable for giving a rd world standard of sky use a combination of overseas call centres and uk and it works,Bad
1383,i cancelled my account in september and mobile however all but the mobile service was actually cancelled they are now chasing me for money and threatening me with when i try and contact talk talk to pay the outstanding balance they will not help me because i dont remember the online pass code and because i have cancelled my broadband and landline i cannot access my account to change the password so catch,Bad

1393,they wont even allow me to unlock my phone they stating i need to be with them for months whereas vodafone has unlocked my phone within first month,Bad
1394,if i could give less than star i would the engineer was supposed to install fibre on the th of october a tree was in the way again th of october however this time tree was ok but now a flat roof was in the way so scaffolding is needed they could have checked notes as all houses on the street are the same and most have bt lines nov unannounced started erecting scaffolding in the wrong part of the house without ringing a doorbell no high hopes that the fibre will get installed on the st of november,Bad
1395,after years with vodafone i will be leaving them asap i have had issues with data reporting i have x vodafone apps x iphone data counter on my phone when to vodafone internal data system all show different amounts gb to gb obviously this is a customer fault vodafone can do absolutely nothing to assist i have a data hungry phone that is the end of the story as far as they are my synopsis to added gb to my standard gb account for august on the day it expired i was told that i had already been charged an additional for exceeding my limit even though further conversations with vodafone showed this to be incorrect they decided as a show of goodwill they credited my account note they didnt say it was a mistake they paid goodwill stretching the kpis for ofcom a little there to ensure this was not my phone i visited a genius from apple who checked everything on my phone concluded that there is nothing running let alone installed that would be causing that amount of data usage in one month weeks later and my current data has gone out of control several unhelpful phone calls later visits to shops live chats has resulted in me finding out that vodafone take hours to update your data no two service representatives give you the same answer hour call back on escalations means working days not days like you would expect attempts to call back does not exist two of my escalations have resulted in callbacks of attempts in about min attempt which the network dropped me you then get a message saying thanks for contacting vodafone everything is now sorted here is the beauty though after informing me of this next point they are now backtracking denying it any data used on an period is carried over to the next period even though your contract is for a set period in essence they double charge you this data usage one last point i am in london where you would expect good coverage however at any grouping of people train station stadium airport the phone will tell you it is receiving g but it will not little icon just keeps like a company you want to waste money on go somewhere else you only have yourself to blame if you choose vodafone i have requested my file so that i can lodge it with ofcom,Bad
1396,having previously left a review cant help but add on with how horribly ee treat their customers what an utter joke this company is will not go into my original complaint of how ee charged me for a few calls from mexico when a family member was taken ill this is more at how i have been treated since i had phoned to complain about this and to be fair to the guy who originally dealt with complaint he was as helpful and he could have been it was when i was passed onto his rude and useless supervisor from the plymouth call centre that things went from bad to worse in the end i was offered a refund of which i was still not acceptable to me but was told if i did not take deal my complaint would go to deadlock and i might never get an offer of a refund again what excellent terminology to use there ee bravo i was so sick of going in circles at this point i accepted the refund i waited working days a only recieved so well done cant even get this right i have now reached the point whereby i dont care about the money i am just so glad my contact is up and have moved on from this vile company the only avenue i have left is an email that i will be sending to the ceo as he should realise the bs his customers have to deal,Bad
1397,would give bt zero if i could after getting no joy with their marketing calls with me they then started flooding my sons mobile with sales calls and even though he said he was not the account holder they set up a brand new contract on my account criminals,Bad
1398,from sign up all ok i had a call early on i mentioned internet seemed to be dropping out to the guy but said it seemed to have just become a fare few months down the line i realise its the router and an issue with the ghz dropping out intermittently more out than in carried out all the usual things and more advanced nothing i contacted talk talk support it really is a shame i cant mention there names on here as my review could be pulled but i should be allowed to as the level of service received from both these people was shocking i dare say that their parents would likely be ashamed of them the service was that bad so the first brainiac said he carried out a test and it was all working see you later basically but maybe in talktalk training sessions they dont explain what intermittent or follow up days on i contacted via chat and got a lady this time who was basically just aww phone up i cant be bothered kind of attitude so i asked if they would waiver my exit fee etc boom she has to actually do some work and look at my account as she clearly did not care about my service issue just passed the book didnt shein the end she did email the case agent god knows what help he will be after his first response mind she also did answer my questions and ask about the fault but only after she was forced to actually do her job and login to my have also requested this raised as a complaint as even though they are leaving me with a faulty service they want for me to exit so lets see if they even bother to follow up with thati have found talk talk business setup follow up initially great however come to an issue they dont care so having a uk call center is about as much use as having one in another country lets just i recommend talk talk to anyone most certainly not,Bad

1402,i recently helped my mother in law yrs of age with terminally ill husband move to vodafone as the contract with her previous company was out of contract at years of age she cannot use a computer and so i help everything seemed okay until activation the activation day the broadband started working but no phone days later the situation has not been resolved i have met lots of excuses promises etc but still no working phone line and despite being a named person on the account most of the time getting them to speak with me is almost all my years of using providers vodafone have proved to be the worst company with no interest in resolving customer problems,Bad
1403,stay well away have placed a default on my credit file for the amount of so from having excellent credit it is now very poor i did not realise this was possible for such a low amount i suffered months of very slow internet with them and although they some compensation it did not reflect the very long time frame that i experienced i will now be complaining to the financial ombudsman service to get my credit file brought back to where it was before and get compensation that i rightfully deserved,Bad
1404,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
1405,absolutely poor disgraceful customer service the worst ive ever seen filled with lies and little to no support nothing factual to provide only a bunch of and various other excuses so the issue weve moved houses we let talktalk know a month in advance and that we would like to get our internet in the new house its been a month and still no wifi first they took over a week just to send someone to take a look then they said we need a new router for better connection and they would send it and we would receive it in working days days later we call them up asking about the status of the new router guess what it hadnt been sent at all having spoken to various members of customer service roughly every days each of them have said the same thing but with different time frames listen if something is not going to work you can tell me itll get fixed in weeks not tell me itll get fixed in days only for me to call back days later asking why it hasnt been fixed and getting a response that itll get fixed in another days and this repeats so now having known that they havent even sent the router despite telling us that it had in face been sent they now suddenly inform us of some works being done nearby our house so they are unable to establish a connection excuse me if you had been prompt with your service as we had paid for then perhaps this wouldnt have been an issue why is this something you are bringing up now why does this mean you need to delay sending the router surely itll save time to send it so we can set it up straight away once the job is done absolutely shambolic having been a talktalk customer for over years now i am severely disappointed and absolutely disgusted perhaps the only thing stopping us from switching internet providers at this point in time is because the wait and the stress of going another month with internet is too much not only is it the summer holidays where the kids have more of an excuse to use the internet but we also have children that need to complete their studies their for example and this is a massive halt in progress i cannot express my disappointment with this company and the misinformation being fed to us through each person we speak to in customer service is deeply saddening i would advise to anyone that has issues with talktalk to not even bother contacting their customer services they are no help just switch your internet provider and wait out the month itll be worth it in the long run terrible,Bad
1406,virgin medias communication is not as it should be i have had various issues to resolve and trying to speak to an administrator is very improve your customer service performance you need to address how you correspond with your customers,Bad

1426,i am extremely disappointed with virgin media broadband ive been with them for year and a half almost i really regret the moment i chose to continue my contract with them first i bought the fibre broadband alone no rental line and the price it was plus an extra which i will be getting it a refund thats what they say also a admins fee i was living at the old address by then i never received those back even after year was over of contract and i continued with them the nd year months later i already got an email being told that an extra it will be added to my contract it wasnt even over at least and ive been charged extra recently i moved my address and i contacted them about move of address which i have been charged admins fee again i said nothing and i was fine by that but not long after being told that my first bill at the new address it will be an estimated amount of which it was really funny because first i never got my refund since i bought the package and second how can bill admins fee make a total of i was shocked and i asked will those money be taken out of my bank account the staff said well you will also get a refund of from your old address that will be added on your bill to the new address well then lets say thats great then because i was meant to get that refund ages ago not now the staff then said your first bill at the new address will only be i was alright by that even so it was unfair not long i get an email with my upcoming bill payment saying clearly well on the date of it will be taken out of your bank account and over i keep getting letters email about offers and to recommend virgin media to friends family really like really do you virgin media deserve that i was really planning on continuing my contract for the following year also and mainly to change my fibre broadband package to a higher one to add more devices since the one i had its about sadly thats not going to happen not even recommend you to no one ever not even continue with you guys no more and those money it will not be taken out of my bank account surely,Bad
1427,virgin most uncaring most unconcerned company in the world the customer service team dont care about anything m all they do is repeat themselves i have had an issue for over a year im not one person has bothered to try to fix it my window has been left open due to a completely unprofessional technician i have complained many times not one person has logged a complaint not one person cared and they have decided to cancel my contract because i owe them i am willing to pay that right now but they just hang up the phone on me like they do every time i think virgin media need to sort it out it is disgusting i have never dealt with a company like it if you read these reviews read by dont ever go to virgin media its more hassle than it is worth and too expensive for what are you actually get go to sky they offer you so much more,Bad
1428,vodafone is a waste of money and one of the worst networks in london the company does not take any responsibility as well,Bad
1429,far to expensive now and keeps going up and the service is getting worse,Bad
1430,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
1431,i had a day rolling contract on a dongle with ee as i just moved house months later i got virgin media installed and call ee to cancel my day rolling contract they offered me a ipad for a month instead of a month and i would not have to pay the upfront it keep me as a customer i got my ipad and month later the sent me a bill for i called them and they went back on their word and said i either have to pay and a month or just a month without the so im now stuck in a month contract paying a month i then got a phone months later and took my number with me from it took ee month to change my number so i was paying a month for months with a completely different number then my first bill came for all for incoming calls they sorted it in the end and admitted they made a mistake basically dont accept their offers because they will go back on their word and when you get a new phone on contract dont expect it to be plain sailing it will be very stressful but it will all work it self out in the end just remember if you miss your direct debit they automatically take it out again days later so if you pay it within the days you will either pay twice or you will get a nd missed direct debit from your bank,Bad
1432,very very bed service by tesco mobilei got my replacements sim which mention in letter is active which is not then i call customer service and request to activate she say will done in or hour after hour not done i call again another person told st lady not active i m going to do wait hours then next day i call no one can short this thing out for me now its been so long and number used by my wife and also have kid imagine you cant and cant go any where coz you dont have your number active no data and all pathetic service and now i want to leave the tesco mobile and switch to another company this bloody people not give puk number as well really not understand what to do plz think time before you buy tesco mobile if you still buy ready for all this,Bad

1436,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad
1437,i contacted virgin media to make these aware that i was moving and to find out whether i could move my account to the new house i contacted them which they stated it would be a moving fee however they would waiver it in this instance i then rang up later to explain that the move in date was pushed back so i would like to change broadband date to september i explained that i would not have to pay the moving fee virgin media agreed since then they have cut my internet off for one day on august which i had to ring for several hours to get it sorted as they hung up on me twice i finally got through on the whatsapp chat which they were able to fix during this chat these changes my account terms to per month when i was originally paying per month since then i have tried to contact their complaints team which they have directed me to their phone number which they hung up on me again i just want this issue fixed,Bad
1438,misinformation when i purchased my bundle now means i have a brand new nd tv that has been rendered useless because i cannot access any tv services on it without a nd box virgin now tell me that they are not installing nd boxes at the moment and do not know when they will be doing so as for trying to contact them its virtually impossible to get a reply,Bad

1441,i had ordered a move on march the person who took the order said he was making it for march but i could call and cancel i did that but exactly at am on march my service was disconnected my hub indicated that i had no broadband by the evening the hub indicated my broadband had a fault engineer appointments were booked two were not attended without any cancellations being notified to me and one turned up saying he could not do anything as my service had been disconnected i will be without broadband for days when the next engineer is due to arrive on tuesday and bt staff can only say im sorry but there is a fault on the line bt engineers apparently do not take notes of their visit and attempts to get a service reinstated either,Bad
1442,i joined in with little options of other companies supplying the area signed up under the impression i was in an month contract and i was assured via telephone i would not be forced to restart the months if i had to move during this time i moved homes in july and the process of a so called easy and convenient home move was a nightmare i moved into my new property and for days had no idea what was going on my internet was meant to be connected on day and i waited until day to call them i figured i should try to be patient they told me they are having issues with disconnecting the line at the old house and until that was complete i could not use my services at the new house they failed to let me know any of this previously i then waited another days called them multiple times i was being passed from pillar to post talking to people who seemingly could not understand the english language i was so fed up with the extremely fake and unbelievably rude excuse for customer service and felt forced into cancelling i was taking university exams at the time and my internet connection for studying was essential disabled student i decided to go to another company and argue the cancellation fees via their complaints procedure i sent a letter and days later i had received no response i then sent a second letter to the ceo office address and got an email response asking me to call a rep who would deal with my complaint via telephone warning do not do this talktalk have hired rottweilers to take care of the complaints simply by getting you on the phone and playing hard ball being rude and intimidating i was charged for cancelling due to their issues of not providing the services that they promised on top of this i was billed for a month of services after cancelling and this was wavered whilst on the phone to the rep as a gesture of good will how can it be called good will when i did not have the services installed and therefore could not be billed for them i have never had such an awful experience with a company so incompetent with rude staff from the top of the hierarchy to the bottom and they truly do not care whether they lose a customer or insult a human being to get the result that they want its funny how when you leave them because they fail to provide what they are contracted to provide its ok for them to break the contract time and time again but when you want to leave because of this you are the one who has to pay,Bad
1443,broadband was quite good until last year but suddenly everything became terribly unstable for about months no answer from them just said someone was working on the issue and will let us know when then things have been slightly better but still not at the same level as before and every month or so line become unstable i will be switching soon dear emma thanks for answering the problem has nothing to do with my setup virgin confirmed there was when i first experienced issues and there is again now an outage in my area the promise is that tomorrow everything will work again i will see if that is true and maybe keep the plan a little longer until i find a better option but if tomorrow things are still not working i will close immediately very tired of virgin not caring about their the meantime i am spending even more more money to work off my phone network,Bad
1444,terrible service even fibre is keep disconnecting and slower connection,Bad
1445,it is typical of vm that the moment a service fails they fail to declare it anywhere later they will deny it ever failed in order to avoid paying any refund worst customer service imaginable,Bad
1446,probably the worst customer service i have ever received and still getting worse by the day i am getting regular nuisance emails and letter advising that i have cancelled by contract and leaving them they even bill me why because they cant get a grip with their systems communication between teams is a joke you will explain yourself over and over and over until you lose the plot not to even think of contacting their customer service they will simply keep you on the phone then hang up on you this cowboy telecom provider is a complete waste of time i regret using them,Bad
1447,absolutely disgraceful service appalling wifi greatly over priced we left due to price and terrible wifi after leaving virgin customer service contacted us to offer half price months shows how much they rip you off normally with a promise to fix wifi we re engaged but wifi literally non existent and no fix or diagnostic so went back to the customer service man martin stannard he refused to answer any communication so left again filed a complaint that martin lied and conned us into another contract and funnily enough no response an awful deceitful lying company with no standards and appalling wifi will never use virgin for anything again branson you should be ashamed,Bad

1471,i have had an ongoing issue that ive reported no less than seven times to the point i stopped my direct reported initially that there was an intermittent signal in my home it took them a further two months to diagnose its a problem with the cable i was made at every turn to feel as though the issue were my own and nothing to do with issue still hasnt been rectified and i still have not heard back from my numerous money is currently held in trust in an account as non payment seems to be the only language that virgin to kath thank you for the information you have provided once again stating that the fault is the fault as admitted by your engineer is the cable from the box to the house still not resolved as of st contact no follow up nothing equally no money until you fix it,Bad
1472,the worst company ive ever dealt with i made an order for fibre medium and an appointment was scheduled with an technician to come to the premises to install the line the technician came and said he was unable to find where the phone line was coming from and that another appointment was required okay these things happen ill just have to schedule another off work talktalk schedules a second appointment and once again the technician reports the exact same problem i thought this was odd because i figured the previous technician would have told him the difficulties he had but this did not seem to be the case so for the second time i get a technician trying the same thing and getting the same exact result fine lets book a third appointment i called customer service this time to find out what was going on but the guy on the phone clearly outsourced had absolutely no clue what i was saying and just kept repeating the same thing over and over it says here that another appointment is required no but he couldnt tell me why they kept making the same mistake after realizing i was getting nowhere with this guy i booked the third appointment third off and this time no one shows up i call talktalk and asked what the hell happened apparently they forgot to send my confirmation to bt so they did not send any technician over i was furious and was asked to speak to the department this time i was transfered to someone who spoke english and i explained my entire situation he apologised for their mistakes waived the installation fee and scheduled a th appointment i told him to let the bt technician know that this is not an easy install clearly there is a strange issue that will require a bit more effort than a standard procedure installation he said he would leave a note fourth appointment comes along and the technician is having the same problems as the previous ones i told him about the issues the other techs had and asked if he had any notes about this to my amazement he said no in other words technicians came to the premises failed to do finish the job and left no notes so once again the same attempts and the same problems at this point im fuming four off months since i placed my fibre order and every visit since the first is a complete waste of my time i send an angry complaint to talktalk explaining my entire situation i point out that they have provided me with zero customer support and even though the techs were from bt as their customer they should be ensuring that bt is not going to send another tech to waste my time the complaint was paragraphs long very detailed and i noted that if i get another scripted answer from them i would leave negative reviews about their crappy service well im here now and as you can imagine their response was a scripted one there was absolutely no reference to any specifics mentioned in my complaint the customer rep simply said that they saw on my account that fibre did not go live since the last appointment and that theyve raised an escalation absolutely no mention or acknowledgement of my four failed appointments nothing in specific to my problems was acknowledge in the response a template answer is what i got ridiculous avoid this company at all costs they dont know what the meaning of customer service is,Bad
1473,after having many good years with bt i decided to move to a brand new property and hopefully transfer the line to the new address but that never happened i was promised several visits from engineers and took days off work only for them not to bother turning up i was also assigned several case managers who promised the earth but never delivered bt would just keep telling me its that are having the issues not us i might be able to accept that if wasnt bt but it is ive given up on bt and will never use them for anything anyone but bt,Bad

1483,i would not recommend this company if they were giving away their services for free i called them to change my package as it was due to end and i was given a great deal and told my future bill would be per month to virgin and per month to o for my mobile sounded great till the confirmation email came through stating my next bill would be i called about this and was told they had no record of this email and i probably wouldnt be charged that so i asked the guy to just cancel the new deal and i would call the next day to sort out the deal again the guy then proceeded to cut my services off there and then the phone went dead as we spoke i called back on my mobile and got a manager who said the guy had in fact cut me off even though i was still in contract for another weeks he got me back up and running as i needed the internet as i work from home and he sorted out the new deal great or so i thought later that evening my internet went down again and the indian tech guy said get this there has been a wifi blockage and you will just have to give it an hour or so to clear i mean really the next morning was the same and the woman at tech support said she could see my internet had dropped out times in the last few days and i would need a technician but she couldnt book one so i would have to wait till lunch time for her supervisor to come in well that was enough so i eventually got put through to disconnections and then ended up speaking to the rudest woman ever who said she could sort out a technician but not till days later which i pointed out was no good as i work from home and rely on stable internet after a while of her telling me that if i cancelled not to expect to be able to get the same deal and various other reasons why i should not cancel she did the discontinuation request but then said id have to sort out cancellation of the o contract as it had nothing to do with virgin despite the fact they set it up anyhow im now out of this rubbish service from the end of january and cant wait as there wireless internet is despicable and just to cap things off i got a call last night from their customer relations team to reassure me they could sort all of this out and could i give her a brief summary of what had gone wrong so having gone through the saga with her i was asked what it would take for me to stay to which i replied that if they offered me all of my services free for a year i still wouldnt stay with that she said thank you and hung up this is virgin media at their best so if your looking for a phone tv and broadband package give these clowns a wide birth,Bad

1507,just phoned orange or ee or whoever they are to cancel two contracts specifically called their business teams number knowing the personal team would not be able to help as my phones are on business contracts was kept waiting with the usual were experiencing very high ad infinitum then infuriatingly the call dropped probably due to oranges notoriously poor signal i was walking around as it was my started the process again and after about twenty mins got through to a man who said id come through to their personal team but not to worry hed put me through to the business team which he did as i was in to him at the terrible service finally got through and from there it went smoothly two phones cancelled for unrelated reasons and theyll never have my business again advice to orange sufficiently staff your call centres or lose customers service on the cheap is a false economy,Bad
1508,we moved back to bt for our business line in january this year it is safe to say it was the worst business decision we have ever made every month has been a hassle to the bill half a day wasted every month a its almost impossible to speak to customer services when you do they laugh at you or call you a liar b they charge you for paper billing but then dont set up the online account properly c because youre unable to access the online account you incur late payment charges d they dont allow you to check data of excessive charges online but you have to wait weeks for a paper copy thus incurring even more late charges e when you try to download a vat invoice the system wont allow it because it says you have paper billing we dont f when you want to notify them of a payment in order to avoid any more late payment charges theres an internal systems error and you cant tell anyone at this stage see point a and begin again g want to complain they make it so convoluted and frustrating i imagine most people give up not that thats their plan of course i would never use bt again and as soon as i can afford their astronomical early termination fees i will cancel our contract and never ever use them again im just so glad i didnt move from virgin media to bt at home,Bad
1509,if i could give zero stars i would i have moved abroad and dealing with o has been by far the hardest part to deal with i write this as i am on hold to them and have been for hours not including the minutes where they hung up on mei just want to settle my device plan so that i can cancel my contract with them and a simple task for them is apparently not so easy i call the number im told to then get transferred through to numerous have been an o customer for years and in recent months their customer service has plummeted do not use o they are a complete waste of time and a joke of a business this all on the same day that they email to say that their prices are going up by during a cost of living crisis way to treat loyal customers,Bad

1521,we signed up for vm on the th of september with an installation date of the following week to date we still have no services after numerous installs cancelled by vm tying to speak to anyone at customer services is unbelievably exhausting they are trying their best and they are always so polite but i dont think they understand how annoying this is and we are never any further forward we still have no idea when the installation will take place or if it will at all we just know that they need to speak to the council to get authority to dig up something somewhere who knows we are most likely going to cancel our order due to lack of any acknowledgement from vm all it would take is for them to be a bit more open and honest and we might understand but they havent so we have no option to think they are ignoring us with the hope that we will wait indefinitely until they pull their finger gonna to get to my point im sure they are fine if they install your services if you have any issues at all i would cut your losses and run,Bad
1522,unreliable wifi for a long time the help centre are hard to issues need to swap supplier,Bad

1526,avoid awful company awful service awful products a third rate company and cant wait to leave their services for both business and home,Bad
1527,these will outright give you false information constantly mess up and nothing about their service is consistent they cut off my neighbours network shut it down completely when i had signed up god knows why we both had to contact them and sort out the mix up which by the way getting in contact is no easy task you have to be persistent dedicated and take note of each interaction because they will lie to you in the everything is up and running the service can be good its just literally everything else this company provides that is royally oh not to mention they will constantly be trying to take money out of your account days before the bill itself is due regardless of whether or not youve cancelled the direct debit avoid someone needs to sue this scam of a company,Bad
1528,more concerned about adding products to your contract than sorting out got an ipad in march but only recently found out that the sim card didnt work as always used it on wifi after several hours on the phone to ee they then cancel my phone sim and send a new phone sim instead of sending one for the ipad this leaves me with no usable phone at added the iwatch to account but it was done incorrectly and had to spend a few hours on the phone to fix seemed they were more interested in adding more and more to my account than actually giving it linked to issue left with no usable phone at work so not able to make or receive calls on a brand new speaking to ee tech and getting sim cards sent out no customer care to recompense the inconvenience caused by lack of attention to detail when selling items i have just renewed the account with iphone iwatch and broadband and beginning to doubt that was the right decision i am leaning towards cancelling everything and just having the ipad on the account till it runs out,Bad
1529,was sent letter saying needed to up grade system fitted new modem and router router needed app to work didnt have smart phone so router wouldnt work was sent another router this didnt work was told possible modem fault had new one fitted still didnt work was sent another router got it all set up when modem fell of wall pulling out fibre wire reported it had no reply for days so had enough of being passed for to talk talk saying it was each others fault so i had no internet from may june cancelled account gone with another company had internet up and running in hours,Bad
1530,where do i begin having read through many other reviews of the extremely poor service that virgin offer i am amazed and comforted at the same time not only do they still remain in business why scoring on their poor the amazing bit but i find that i am among many thousands of like minded individuals that share the absolute worst experience imaginable mr branson what are you doing tom ceo where are you surely you cannot be happy about the results that are displayed for all to see from trustpilot you seriously cannot expect to keep a company going on this performance rating ive run a company for years and if i ignored treated made it this difficult for my customers i wouldnt have any customers left but there again who am i just a customer who pays you every month for a service you are failing to provide and a problem that just wont resolve by itself update to this some weeks later as no one has contacted me from virgin they are just about to put their prices up again making the basic broadband deal only almost a month not bad for a consistently poor performance i can only say to anyone wanting broadband be sure what kind of speed you actually need as other suppliers might just offer enough for your needs and you dont necessarily need the fastest speed around time is up for me so im cancelling my subscription of many years with virgin and im off to try another supplier due to lack of service and pure greed,Bad
1531,i have already left talktalk and they are still sending me bills and making it outstanding bills one of the scam company dont use this internet service provider it will kill you mentally,Bad
1532,ive been with o since and satisfied with service though expensive until battery on my iphone s became faulty weeks ago got this phone new from o and can no longer use unless its wired up to charger i have months left on my month contract complained to o who advised that i upgrade and change my phone because a battery replacement would cost over but there may still be problems with my current phone they then demanded for upgrade but after considering the inconvenience i have experienced and my complaint because the phone should be fit for purpose for the duration of contract o informed me that the fee was waived they then complicated matters by not allowing a standard upgrade and that i would have to go through new which worked out more expensive so they were trying to make up for waived fee after many calls to o and approx hours trying to resolve this i eventually decided to go with tesco mobile and found a much cheaper deal on exactly the same upgrade phone baker from complaints review acted making out as though she waived the fee but stung me on disappointed after being a loyal customer for years,Bad
1533,talktalk set a new benchmark for incompetents and terrible customer care every communication takes an hour and achieves nothing ive had a speed fault for weeks so far this has wasted around hours of my time and still isnt rectified,Bad
1534,i have been with virgin for over and yrs and experienced problems with intermittent connection problems for many months in the last months i had made numerous calls raising my concerns had engineers visiting our property all of them echoing that the problem was cables when i tried to check about getting this fixed the customer care was horrible and there is no communication amongst the teams and i was once told that cables were already changed when no one had even touched the cables i have a very important exam in another this month which is meant to be online since virgin failed to resolve my problem i have decided to leave and gave my notice last month to avoid added stress of poor internet connectivity on the top of my exam after i gave an initial notice to cancel my account i received a call from a very nice agent offering me discount reducing my connection charges lesser than new provider and also promising to get my cables sorted on th march i have received an email that i would receive cash back of pounds due to cancellation of appointment was cancelled yet again and postponed which is not fixed i was left in difficult position and i have spent my precious time and energy in chasing up about again and again with no success since they failed to keep their promise of fixing my cables and out of desperation for a reliable network before my exam i decided to leave virgin now when i try to cancel services i was told that i would be charged pounds which is appalling i am seriously looking at taking my complaint with virgin forward for the emotional distress that they have caused me and put me in a difficult position before my exam worst customer service and support,Bad
1535,really annoyed i called up to cancel and the advisor offered me a good deal to stay however when my bill has come through its a month more expensive than agreed i called back and an advisor explained the manager hasnt signed off on the agreed discount i am now waiting for the manager to call back and explain what has happened more time wasted having to call customer services and sort it out i am now past the cooling off period so virgin better honour the discount which was agreed verbally,Bad
1536,process was very easy ryan new what he was talking about and helped me in my indecision about broadband our broadband was meant to have a go live date or april th this was then pushed to april th for no apparent reason after several phone calls the broadband box finally got delivered on nd april only for the wifi not to be connected im starting to feel like im dealing with a different company than the one im reading reviews about,Bad
1537,top tip for anyone trying to leave this horrendous company when you try to cancel your contract make sure the operator takes you through security first before you state or mention anything about wanting to leave if you say you are intending to leave before they complete security with you the operator will hang up the phone on you this will repeat like this for hours days weeks if you do not follow the above process why do i know this i was told by an employee directly that operators are currently heavily targeted on their customer retention and they are mostly working from home if the operator does not go through security with you and the call gets disconnected ie they hang up on you then they are not required to call you back or deal in anyway with your request they will ask you what you want before going through security to find out if you want to leave because if they do not want your cancellation on their record this is why they hang up as soon as you say you intend to leave before they take you through make sure the operator texts you and emails you to confirm they will cancel your contract before they leave the call please do not let them lie to you they cannot do this as it will force them to actually action your request as you have proof with text and email please dont let them fob you off that this is exclusively would not even leave with star if this was possible how the mighty of have fallen years ago were probably one of the best companies to go with now your looking at an exceptionally bad service and a diabolical business model illegal which refuses to let customers leave,Bad
1538,recently took out wifi contract with home telecom arranged this just before going away for weeks which we explained to the salesperson who seemed nice we were worried that the router would be returned to sender while we were away as we would not be able to collect it from the post office on time and mentioned this to him as we were thinking of getting the router delivered somewhere else to be safe so its not like we were going to cancel and he needed to try and keep us interested he assured us the router should fit through our letterbox so we went away assured that it would be ok we returned to the property to find a royal mail card that we had missed the delivery and as predicted the router had been returned to sender we contacted home telecom and they agreed to send out a duplicate router at a charge of which we disputed as we had advised the salesperson that we were away and he had assured us it should fit so we should not be paying an extra fee to have it they agreed to listen back to the call and look into wavering the fee home telecom are now claiming that this was not mentioned in the call and are charging us the they didnt dispute that the salesperson knew we were away for weeks so surely they could have worked out we would not be able to receive the router we have not had any apology and feel let down after such a positive initial call with the salesperson the wifi is good but unfortunately we have had a very bad experience within our first month of taking out this deal which has ruined it would not take a deal out with them again in the future on i am unable to reply to your message as i no longer have access to the email linked to my facebook account which i used to write this review the account is in my partners name j hardcastle but the payment came from my card which will confirm i am a genuine customer i appreciate you looking into this for us,Bad

1540,purchased an lg inch tv from bt shop and it arrived pretty the delivery driver was on his phone talking to someone in his own language the package was slid to me across the floor and he went the packaging was battered and dented so in view of this i decided from previous experience to video myself opening the box and also videoed myself setting the tv upi cleared my space for the new tv and could see the clear plastic sheet covering the screen appeared rumpled when i switched he tv on to set up it was clear the rumpled effect was in fact a crack that came from the bottom corner of the set this lines up with the indentation on the contacted bt shop immediately by phone and was requested to send photos as my videos would be to large to send i would concur with of front and back of tv and box were sent then resent as they could not open i was advised that tv was now out of stock and i would not get another advised that due to the poor service from the courier and that i was advised they were having trouble with tvs being broken on delivery that perhaps they would offer an upgrade as a gesture of i was told would not happen could i advise a date i would be in to arrange collection this would be an all day slot yet delivery was an hour i would be refunded when the tv was in the cannot guarantee that the couriers that collect the damaged goods will deliver them back so why should i wait for i paid through paypal and will put payment in cannot blame the bt customer service staff but their processes and procedures need re examining as they are not customer not purchase any goods from this,Bad

1544,i have been with o more than years and i got a new contract out it was with o but through samsung website they obviously didnt like the fact i got a cheaper contract then themselves via samsung i am appalled at hoe they have treated me ive had barely any signal they ask me to send screenshot of when the problem occurs how do you send a screenshot of call failed or when a call cant come through to you and they have to call you on a different line its abysmal and to put salt on the wound they have increased my monthly bill by so fluctuating network and now paying more for this crappy network i also feel the customer service i received has degraded over the years no one cares how loyal youve been or how having ridiculous network may affect you when youre alone with kids thank you o for making me feel like im cornered into a contract with terrible service,Bad
1545,i can honestly say in years of being in customer service i have never experienced such appalling service,Bad
1546,their customer service is absolutely awful they make it difficult to actually speak to a human through their multiple choice and when you finally get through you are put on hold forever having to listen to the same message over and over and over again they have really done their best to make you not bother if your problem cant be solved online you are pretty screwed reply is useless did you actually read what i cant get through to speak to anyone and thats after several went on line topped up all worked fine next morning i have been your company is a joke,Bad

1587,where do i start i ordered broadband with them on the st of september on this date i was told that i was booked in with an engineer for the th so i travelled to nottingham for that date having to take time off specifically for this then on the morning of the th im sent an email telling me to get ready for my installation on the st after waiting hours on hold im told to wait until for the engineer which i knew wasnt going to happen so on the st when im not in the county i get a call telling me that the bt open zone guy is outside once i tell vodafone about this problem they were quick to give me gb free if i was with vodafone mobile which im glad im not or add credit to my account which costs them nowhere near as much as it costs me to travel on short notice and take days off work to be stood up after calming down and agreeing to have an engineer come on the th of october days notice an engineer shows up on the th which was incredibly inconvenient because it made me late for work waiting for this guy to do absolutely nothing as it turns out then i called to find out why this was the case and was told that engineers come whenever theyre free and around your area now even a child can point out why this would be an infinitely bad idea especially since if youre unavailable for your surprise visit youre charged a missed appointment fee but that aside the broadband still wasnt working after installation i once again called vodafone th time by this point and was told that it wouldnt go live until the th which i thought was fair the th finally came and the broadband still wasnt working so when i called th time i was told that the broadband order on my account was cancelled and that apparently this is a rare situation that never happens but theyre going to try to fast track my activation date after hearing this nonsense i was contacted later in the day to be given a status update saying btw nothing has happened yet probably the least informative update to ever have to endure i called back later that day to be told that i had an engineer visit on the rd of october which i never booked and had no idea about i still wouldnt have known this date unless i had called them and its lucky i did i was told that the man had not installed the line properly and i need another appointment on a date i never agreed upon i had decided to cancel my account with them and they literally encouraged me to leave no no explanation just shop around and well be happy to cancel your contract free of charge since youre within your first days whats interesting about this is that if i had waited until the rd and nothing had happened id have been outside of my days and wouldve been expected to pay a cancellation fee which felt almost like a plot to trap me within their horrible service not once did i feel like they were listening to my struggle and till this day i still havent received my cancellation email its almost as if theyre trying to be sleazy with their services to suck money out of you i now get nothing from their lack of competence but wasted time and money while these guys laugh all the way to the bank with for their lack of half decent customer support i still have no internet thanks to these clowns i call them clowns because their service is absolutely laughable i honestly wish i could review less than one star because i think even that would be too generous,Bad

1601,talktalk internet is very slow cannot watch a video my connection speed is kb has been for over a week tried to talk over online chat and no one is helping fix anything in fact get texts to say problem fixed when it is in fact worse,Bad
1602,we are long standing customers of talktalk but hopefully not much longer every time we have a problem we get asked stupid questions or questions that we have previously answered such as is you internet connection working this is when we have contacted them on the talktalk internet we have put in a stand alone wall socket new incoming telephone cable as stand alone place for the router facing outwards rather obvious new line have been given all these details but they keep asking we write to them and get no confirmation of receipt and thats when we have informed them we sent it by delivery they sometimes send us a basically useless answer with silly statement on it the last one was posted on a friday and they told us to expect a telephone call on the monday but we only received the letter on the tuesday at lunchtime we have not had any calls from them as dues to the initial letter we purchased a phone with an answering machine which works very well but never any calls from talktalk the list is endless in time and costly my opinion is somebody there just does not care about customers that have the audacity to complain and they also employ some liars we have a response from called chris chris who telling us contact via we don have and dont wish to have twitter and the community are my users on talk talk and are not able to sort out technical talk promised on thursday to sort out or inability to sign in to e mails and come back the next usual they have have not are having to use relatives tablets to see e mails,Bad

1671,absolute rubbish liars and crooks firstly it took more than months to get internet installed secondly it only took that long because of miscommunication and stupidity of the installation team thirdly the engineer damaged my wall and promised nicely to repair it the next day but he didnt show up the next day and just blatantly lied to me customer service has taken more than hours call time of my life they promise credit but it doesnt ever hit my account seriously virgin you are scum the mafia have more decency,Bad

1675,if i could give them no stars i would extortionate prices in addition extremely inflexible and rude customer service team virgin routers are pathetic and unable to deliver the speeds they predict i recently did a test and my internet speed was around in addition the wifi is always low or cutting out unless youre directly infront of the router then you might recieve a speed of i actually have boosters around the house to send signal despite this i still have areas in my house with no internet whatsoever i highly advise you not to go to virgin unless youre some sort of masochist,Bad
1676,no stars talktalk messed up my new broadband order trying to get this rectified proved impossible impossible to speak to anyone on the phone three long chatbot sessions failed to sort it out i have taken my custom elsewhere and would only recommend talktalk to my enemies,Bad
1677,i called talk talk times in the past one week each time i went through security questions not once but about six or seven times nothing appears to be noted apart from wasting not just hours but days of my life in futile fury as i was repeatedly hung up on having waited for hours to speak to technical i still do not have a resolution i am paying a month for an internet service and telephone service which does not work gas not for over a year open reach engineer went there days ago and told me a new internet cable was required however the job needed to be sanctioned by talk talk none of the talk talk individuals spoken with seem to be aware of this or even interested in it there is a problem is able to resolve this problem however talk talk will not simply allow them to do so i finally stated that i wished to put in a complaint apparently this was due for tomorrow between two and three theyve just sent me a text message to say that they are glad the complaint has been resolved this has to be the most frustrating unprofessional organisation that ive ever had the misfortune to try and deal with i am ceasing any further contact with them as life is too short,Bad
1678,took hour to cancel my contract and only option is via the phone the operator refused to do it and kept putting me on hold and asking the same questions such as which service provider i was going with eventually i refused to keep answering and kept repeating i want to cancel but they would not listen system and unecessary waste of my and their time would never use a virgin product again,Bad

1680,department at ee what a joke if ee had an ounce of sense they would offshore that department to india talk about poor staff attitude and inefficient waiting times ironic given its their customer retention call centre based in the uk maybe the staff there feel more entitled than their customers who knows,Bad
1681,really screwed my life up they put a black mark on my credit score for a bill i paid on time this stopped me getting a business loan for six months ultimately my business went under to compensate me they reduced my monthly internet cost really quite insulting,Bad
1682,ordered fiber to the service due to be installed on and still no confirmation to engineer engineer arrived at the property on time all was good he then realised he needed a hoist to fit the connection this was not attainable on the day and i was notified i would be contacted to reschedule a date for the have not received any phone call from vodafone whatsoever and am still without broadband after a month and a half of living in a new gone to phone vodafone which is impossible as none of the numbers work ive used their awful chat bot tobi who knows nothing what so then talked to an agent over the course of hours and was given a rebooked engineer date with no official email confirmation what so ever i cannot risk this rebooked engineer date not going through and i have receive zero correspondence as to when it will this asap i dont care about a day compensation i want my broadband,Bad

1684,ee are the worst company ever to exist nobody there wants to help you and they make it as hard as possible to contact them over any queries you have always raising the prices mid contract which is pathetic as other companys are a spiteful company who are only concerned about money making and dont care how their actions can impact on others lives finally to the ee team who read this dont reply to my message with a load of crap im so sorry about this let me look into it for you if you were so bothered about looking into things and helping others then you would in the first place your replys are only an act to make peoples honest reviews about their awful experiences with you look like lies because your so nice and caring in your replys ee is a company run by clueless who dont have any idea about how to treat people politeness or common,Bad
1685,called to cancel my service because the price was going up at the end of the contract spent good half an hour on the phone where customer representative tried to offer me a better deal none of them were suitable so cancelled as planned some days later before existing contract was to end on jan got a call from virgin offering me broadband only at per month i accepted and got verbal confirmation from the virgin rep that the new broadband only service price would start immediately the old contract ended later got notification that new broadband only service would start long after i was told it would i called to cancel the newly ordered service to be then told i had to give days notice i believe i was misled by the virgin rep who categorically confirmed the new service would start as soon as the old contract ended i ended up paying two months subscription at the virgin standard advertised price virgin could not or would not listen to the recording they must have made when i signed up to the broadband only service to confirm what i was telling them virgin has lived up to its poor customer service reputation virgin media needs to be exiled to necker island with its old boss virgin media if you are listening never again will you get my hard earned cash however fast you claim your service to virgin responded to my poor review they provided a phone number to call which is not a dedicated number so you have to go over the problem with a rep all over again my service ends feb the final bill issued charges me up to march i called a few days back and was informed they would change my final bill and a revised bill would be available in a few hours like hell it is on the phone to virgin again because nothing has changed that was a painful call i am now informed that my final bill will charge me up february lets see i feel sorry for the virgin reps that handle customer complaints because they are not given the discretion to deal with refunds if they deem it appropriate,Bad
1686,very poor service i have facing the network issues from days also no support of customer care very poor service i am not happy with vodafone service,Bad
1687,tried to stop our contract just now due to poor connection the customer service sounds like a dummy for keep asking us to repeat what we said and she asked us to give days notice to cease the contract says its their policy fine but our contract ends on she couldve told me that i can stop our contract on but she didnt instead she put it through and ends it on and we will be charged for penalty for those days breaking the contract and paying for another month fee too this is ridiculous and not to mention the broadband connection is very poor and the router they sent us before didnt work at all will never use talktalk again,Bad
1688,what i will say is that vodafone are consistent consistently awful having spoken at length with a customer person a week ago and renewed my contract i have now been told that everything the agent told me last week was wrong and i need to pay extra per month for a longer contract the left arm of the company dont know what the right arm are doing maybe thats on purpose so they can get more money from you go elsewhere,Bad
1689,i joined about a year ago have had nothing but problems since was with others before never had these problems emailed dido harding twice but all i got was a standard email and was referred to chief execs team who arent much better says it all really chief exec has to have a team of people to deal with her complaints if service was any good noone would need to contact her this company is by far the worst i have ever had to deal advice is pay anything but do not go with talk talk,Bad
1690,worst company ever all they do is take your money yet our broadband doesnt even work it was being updated yesterday and then we had nothing at all we have been told no one can sort it until thursday yet this is am on going problem someone comes out sports it and then it goes again customer services helpline is unhelpful do not take broadband out with this company,Bad
1691,they only tell me on the phone and online about their most expensive deals they have much much cheaper deals with almost the same package but they wont tell me about them even though they keep emailing to say that my contract is expiring soon and i need to renew eventually when i said i was leaving someone today said that they can only tell me about cheaper deals close to or after the contract expires so over the years i am on the most expensive deal without ever wanting or needing the tiny extras only because i was always told there was nothing much cheaper surely that cant be allowed,Bad

1697,this is a star review because trustpilot does not allow no of hard drives and enclosure were sent to me without any protective packaging hard drives loose in a jiffy bag were sent by regular post arriving just after i discovered the hd enclosure had been placed in a larger cardboard box with absolutely nothing else to pad it or restrain movement before being sent by courier across to n ireland both packages had a fragile sticker but that is hardly enough to ensure the items travel accepted delivery because there was no evidence of damage to the outer box and was horrified to discover the inner item had been unrestrained in its journey i am now arranging a return since there is no way to know what harm occurred in transit and whether the gear will work out of the box or develop faults in a few weeks time this is not the sort of computer backup anyone would want to rely onthe fact that goods are likely to be harmed in transit without proper packaging is demonstrated by bt shop explaining how goods for return should be packaged to avoid damage had they followed their own instructions re adequate packaging and protection i would not be expensively am absolutely furious this is the first and last time i will use bt shop which i mistakenly thought was a reputable seller i would recommend prospective customers to buy elsewhere,Bad

1716,totally unacceptable changes to choices governing my broadband agreement were confirmed by tt on numerous occasions as having been made by them but they hadnt this necessitated a ridiculous amount of time spent chatting to various personnel and usually being transferred from one agent to another with the need to repeat the whole story problems were never properly resolved and in my view and from that experience any agreement or changes made by tt and confirmed by their own emails or in chat transcripts on numerous occasions simply cannot be relied upon be warned if you ever need to make any changes to an agreement or are contracting for a service and expect to be dealt with properly youre unlikely to get it,Bad
1717,i made the terrible decision of switching from bt to virgin back in may things went wrong form the very beginning no one ever came to install the access cable to the property in order to receive the advertised gb speed in stead the engineer found a year old cable which belonged to a company acquired by virgin on the day of the inhalation he didnt even had the tools to remove the face of the housing to access the cable when he finally reached the cable he then ran the cable alongside our living room wall and while drilling to run the cable into the other room he basically destroyed our living room wall he told me that everything was going to be ok and that someone from virgin would come back to fix the wall within a few days its been months about phone calls and we are still waiting for some one to come a sort out the mess they call me and offer me one month free services as compensation and off course i declined while writing thus review i was on the phone to them and was told for the st time the same thing and i quote some one from the fields team will call you within one week also the internet is always dropping and the speed is no where near the minimum we should be able to achieve terrible company terrible customer service complete disregard for customer and total lack of ownership to their errors and faults will be leaving and moving back to bt if the issue isnt sorted within the week as i have just been promised do not move to virgin or sing up to their services,Bad

1721,virgin this is what you are bullies rude ignorant dont know what you are talking about having customers struggling with language barriers not empathetic or sympathetic selling products to people who dont need them over inflating your prices saying one thing and doing another not listening to the customer and talking over the customer shouting at customers and telling them it is their fault not refunding when you say you will putting customers on hold for no reason unsure what the word no means twisting what customers say liars putting up customers bill by instead of which was in a letter needing to have more customer service training because it is currently st losing a customer quite frankly you should go into administration and leave this type of work to people who know how to run it and work it properly and know what they are certainly dont support those customers who have been loyal plus years and treat them like something you stood i could rate you a minus star i would because star is certainly something you are not worth goodbye,Bad

1759,id already wasted a day waiting on engineer that didnt turn up contacted chat line and was told id get a call within hours to arrange an engineers visit eight days later still nothing contacted chat line again and was told engineer had escalated my slow speed mb instead of mb to the fault manager my line was working fine until i changed providers im regretting it already i feel like im getting the runaround i thought talktalk would have learned some lessons by now their customer service is polite but useless,Bad
1760,talk about a hard sell approach to customers i had a phone call from a guy called simon trying to sell me internet and tv which i had never even inquired about he kept me talking for nearly s of an hour before i finally said id heard enough and i wanted time to think about it he said he would call again later the following afternoon and i ended the call thinking that was literally less than minutes later there was a guy knocking at my door from virgin trying to sell me again he was quite insistent and promised me a better deal than his telesales colleague had just promised he kept me talking for ages before i agreed just to get shut of him then i was bombarded with all sorts of emails asking me for signatures and other legal docs i ignored them for a couple of days then received an email from my existing ip telling me they were sorry to see i wanted to cancel my current contract with them i had to then phone them and cancel my cancellation be advised avoid virgin media at your peril,Bad
1761,too expensive rubbish customer service tied me into a contract i cant get out of until may make me have services i dont need keep taking channels away but still charging same price also have to pay for a booster on my wifi because it doesnt work properly cant wait to get away from them,Bad
1762,stay away even if you have to pay more go with any other company except these scammers cant even be bothered to waste anymore time writing about this company they have lied so much and are totally unreliable in terms of repairing faults been waiting weeks and still not reconnected goodbye and thanks for absolutely nothing,Bad
1763,the virgin engineer sabotaged my bt line during installation and it has all been downhill from there plus it is impossible to contact customer services when you have a frequent problem i will definitely never return to virgin once my contract posted this review in june and virgin media responded in november which says it all,Bad
1764,when online on an internet course my connection out so i miss part of my course,Bad
1765,in my years of being a home owner i have never experience anywhere near the issues i have had with virgin media didnt activate the account taking calls with customer service to resolve billing me incorrect amounts vs contract with late fees as they havent processed my billing information and finally they havent delivered the promotional gift via the affiliate i signed up with the initial level of customer service team is incompetent if you manage to get past the computer says no team the middle level of support have some sort of idea about whats going on however promises and certainties do not deliver if any other company provides fibre to my address i will be leaving virgin in less than a heartbeat,Bad
1766,returned new contracts due to the phones being a little bit for me and my partner after returns are completed i reapplied for similar contracts with smaller iphones and got declined thanks vodafone great way to get rid of customers,Bad
1767,i placed a previous order with voucher and for nd time talk talk say it didnt go through and offer expired so have to pay extra and they dont respond to complaints,Bad
1768,i read talk talks answer to my last posting and tried to get information about contracts time i used landline and spoke to a person instead of using the chat line after carefully explaining i would like more information on upgrading i was asked if i wanted to end my person i spoke to either did not understand me or could not be bothered with wait till my contract ends,Bad
1769,is cheap which is great but when you have a problem youre really as you cant speak to agent and end up in a never ending hour after hour cycle of email and performed a sim swap over hours ago and i am still without service i have been waiting for an agent to contact me online to resolve the problem ive gone beyond frustration and am now away,Bad
1770,i have been trying to contact by phone and their messaging you press submit once youve completed the form it just goes to a blank screen with no confirmation that its been sent on their message service i have tried calling them times over the last four days each an hour long before it have previously spoken to them without too much problems the problems i have been having are sometimes when i try make a call it doesnt start ringing so i have to try again before it rings sometimes i make a call and it rings my end but it doesnt ring the person im calling sometimes i make a call and the person answers but cannot hear me or i cannot hear them or neither can hear anything even though the call is connected sometimes when someone rings me i can hear them but they cannot hear me sometimes when i send a text it is not received by the recipient but there is not indication that it was not sent i have even tried a different phone but the same things happen my data connection used to drop regularly but they seem to have sorted out that problem so it only drops once in a while ill let you decide for yourselves if this is a worthwhile network,Bad
1771,i am a new customer and i wish i would have seen these reviews prior to signing up they are terrible broadband provider worse than talktalk what a huge mistake i made cannot wait to switch anyone reading this do not risk have called and complained numerous times all of this is for show only in fact virgin customer service is some of the worst i have ever experienced on the th october i was told a manager will give me a call back within hrs guess what exactly nothing absolutely nothing happened no communication which is identical to previous do urge anyone reading this to avoid virgin,Bad
1772,my talk talk experience this week i was without broadband for hours midweek because there was a major problem locally i registered for text updates but never received a single one that very evening once broadband was back i received my latest bill to find the basic charge had leapt by nearly without explanation or warning today i tried to find out why in an online chat the service is down as it is being upgraded sorry talk talk i will be leaving you as soon as ive worked out who can give a decent service,Bad
1773,i got bt fibre and for the first months my internet was rubbish so they said the halo discs would definitely help with the signal i couldnt get signal on the phone sitting next to the router so a disc wasnt going to help they then advised me to upgrade to fibre as it would make the experience better but it wasnt for full week at easter i had no internet at all so they send an engineer out but it just happened to start working the day before he landed i asked about compensation for the amount of times i was without internet but was told no im paying for a service that doesnt work properly or care about the customer as long as bt get their money every month i pay per month for a service thats not fit for purpose avoid bt at all cost as their customer service is awful,Bad
1774,i have just changed my contract with virgin media and they put a price increase on my account even before i paid the first bill ive never paid my contract price as is has always been higher avoid this company at all costs it is a big con they want to leave the contract,Bad
1775,i am an elderly person and all i want is to get into my mail but it is blocked by these messages from you and i cannot proceed please please clear it so i can use my mail system again i was speaking to a gentleman and once again it have been updating the mail you,Bad

1777,i have spent hours waiting so far to speak to about being overcharged on my mobile bill i was told by the recorded message at the start of the call that the wait would be to minutes extraordinary times admittedly but i have phoned ee twice today and on both occasions got through in less than minutes the conversation if and when i get through may be a very different one closing my account and going elsewhere outrageous way to treat customers,Bad
1778,ordered broadband from them and they made a st appointment for their engineer to come and asked me to be home on the day i took the day off from work engineer came but said they need to connect a cable outside my house for that and they will send another team but i wont need to be home for that then they called and made another app week later and told me to be home again took off from work again engineer came and said he cant do anything and that i didnt need to be home anyway more weeks go by so i called and ask them to cancel this order as weeks was too much and my actual internet provider has to extend my contract again as the days notice for cancellation have passed as talktalk messed me around for over still came and connected the cable outside my house after weeks and when i called them and ask about this they said they cant cancel without days notice now they sent me a bill too what kind of service is this i didnt even connect your modem never used your service you have messed me about and i have to pay stay away from talktalk,Bad
1779,horrible they to pay for mbs broadband only while not even their guaranteed mbs but mbs at their best day wanted to disconnect since the day i recieved the letter that my contract will end shortly and still ending up paying the fees as everything is hidden under different terms the worst part they keep calling up nearly every day to check havnt i changed my mind even though i told that i have already arranged different broadband provider i mean i told i have cancelled my broadband with them like x at least on different occassions what could else end up paying a whole months value for a broadband i wont use thats how bad it is,Bad
1780,i had weeks to find a company after leaving sky i ordered talk talk fibre i got a order id with a installation date days later no email went on chat and different people couldnt find order i gave them benefit of doubt and tried again days i received order number i even received top cashback and yet no email or text so spent an hour on the chat being told again by different people no order disgrace,Bad
1781,very poor customer service and the wifi signal is poor over charged when my contract had ended to be told the only way of getting the money back was by renewing my contract and they will knock it off the bill,Bad
1782,phoned the tech service as i was having weak signal with my mobile data guy on phone told me to go into settings and make some alterations and he will then call me straight back no call back and the alterations made my phone alot worse why tell customers you will call them straight back and then you dont shocking service,Bad
1783,shocked and stunned at the complete incompetence and unethical behaviour of talk talk customer service and even more so when speaking to the loyalty department we made a simple courtesy call to explain that when our contract expires with them on the th january we will not be renewing this was to avoid them rolling us onto another contract and because we have vacated the property and will no longer be living there here comes the issues as soon as you say you want to cancel your contract when it expires they take this opportunity to put you on hold go away and mark it as you are cancelling mid contract and need to give days notice and sting you with another charge they try and then quickly run you through the new terms all deliberately done to try and make you incur further fees and blame it on the terminology of us wanting to cancel even when explained we arent cancelling but merry not renewing they say okay fine and then try end the call we have had to call times and had this exact same scenario happen after the first saying its sorted yet we get an email saying thank you for sticking with talk talk it goes on and on and too long to even fully explain but absolutely despicable service and am still totally stunned spent hours on the phone terrible terrible terrible,Bad
1784,company like that should not exist,Bad
1785,i needed a new sim but they couldnt let me have one since my old phone was registered to my wife who did not have either of the only forms of id that our local ee shop could accept so i rang ee but they couldnt send me a new sim due to a computer problem,Bad
1786,been having problems with wifi and internet since had new router meaning loss of internet which is disastrous as my partner an essential mainly works at home using her laptop ran the diagnostic sent by virgin ad each times it confirms there are issues but it just says no online appointments available for engineer so it gives you a link and phone number to sort out an appointment but you never get to speak to a human being consequently problem not sorted virgin need to sort me out otherwise im going to another internet provider grrrr,Bad
1787,absolutely rubbish customer service by vodafone if you are looking for a promotional code for vodafone broadband dont bother them because the service you will get from vodafone will be atrocious i strongly suggest that you dont get in contract with vodafone at any cost this is the third time i have been trying to contact vodafone customer service and i have been waiting for more than hour and minutes now but no one answered please do good to your life dont get vodafone home broadband,Bad
1788,i am really disappointed i have called asda customer services three times and been given conflicting information i am currently unable to transfer to the new network i am running out of time and will loose my credit because asda customer service staff have not been adequately trained and are unable to offer a solution really poor service,Bad
1789,prices are not competitive especially for current customers service is patchy at best but its not like we have any other options as virgin seem to own the area long times with down time too,Bad
1790,vodafone cancelled my direct debit due to a direct debit payment bouncing and then cancelled my broadband so i asked them if i could reactivate and they said that i would have to make a new account to reconnect internet i had then payed all my outgoing bills now there trying to charge me even though ive tried to resolve the problem and they wouldnt allow me too i have also got every conversation recorded to prove that vodafone said i owed no more money so i will be taking this further trust me,Bad
1791,one of the worst networks i have ever dealt with would i ever recommend anyone never in million years id rather recommend someone to go and play in the park with jimmy savile o you need to uo your game,Bad
1792,i have received no less than calls over the last couple of weeks from vm to try and discuss my existing contract and sell me addons i advised each caller that unless they could offer me a deal in which i paid less than i currently did then i did not want to discuss and that they should stop calling me but then i get called again and again i explained yet again to the caller yesterday and they actually laughed down the phone at me furious i asked to speak to their manager but they put me on hold and then hung up on is just unacceptable i have been a customer of vm for more than years and do not expect this treatment,Bad
1793,awful network idris at customer service provided me with no help rather felt the need to keep chatting me up strange guy,Bad
1794,the worst customer experience of my life no cs unless you find a magical way through and when you do get in contact they will treat you just like a this company like the they responded to this comment by saying hey len you can contact us via facebook further proving my point that they simply dont care what do i do with that how would that help when cs has already be negligible,Bad
1795,it is the third time i need to reach to support in the last couple of weeks because broadband suddenly goes away today i was waiting for over minutes for a support person to run a check and it seems that he left for some reason as he was not answering my questions i am leaving this company,Bad
1796,been with vodafone for years in recent times their service has become absolutely despicable,Bad
1797,very very slow internet speed even after complaining many time there is no use,Bad
1798,would have given it a review in negative stars but its not there in available option vodafone has the network for broadband and staff are so rude,Bad
1799,terrible cs and connection since lockdown has been woeful we are on mb broadband with speeds during day of mb its killing us parents trying to homeschool and work we have now found out they have an infrastructure issue in the whole area and yet they do not update the service area page probably so they can avoid paying people compensation thousands of complaints in this one area alone because of it and they make you call cs phone lines that are not operable they have certainly let so many of us down i am cancelling as soon as i am through to someone,Bad
1800,worst company has big issue with there servers they need to fix when you make a call no one can hear you but i can hear,Bad
1801,keep well away from them there costumer service is shocking ive been trying to cancel now for days thank you for reply but ive call that number times im still got a message saying an engineer with be coming out,Bad
1802,am leaving after several years of mobile phone broadband and landline ive never been sure which bit is still orange and what is ee therefore bills websites lots of booking in etc decided to move to sky rang ee or orange to get a pac number and advice with unlocking phone as ive never changed before went to website which said i had to ring if leaving did this and eventually got through to operator who asked for details then went through security details so i still hadnt asked my questions yet after minutes he asked me for the last numbers of the bank account i pay my bill from as a security question i told him that my bank details were upstairs that i had mobility problems and that i was reluctant to give bank account details out over the phone could he ask another question ie mothers maiden name etc he refused and said he would not continue if i didnt answer him i was taken aback by his abrupt manner and asked to speak to a supervisor the supervisor adopted the same attitude and refused to proceed until i answered with bank details i only rang out of politeness to made the transfer run smoothly i had no choice but to acquiesce and pass my details over he then said that they didnt want to lose me and would find a special deal for me i informed him that cost was not too important but their customer service and manners were dreadful and if i had any doubts about leaving i certainly didnt have any now and that he was one of the reasons for leaving ee had i been in his presence i would have the arrogant little for speaking to me in that manner the following day i rang the broadband and landline side and was asked for my mothers maiden name notice given and all done in less than a outfit i would never go back to this lot i would write a letter of complaint however i think i would be wasting my time move on,Bad
1803,what an absolute atrocious broadband company to go with i would avoid as much as possible dont think half the staff know what there talking about one telling us if we get a booster its free to ring up today for them to say our bills gone up if this is the case then we will be getting out of the contract asap virgin media i think you need to put your staff on some sort of course to know what there doing in the future,Bad
1804,received email telling me that my fixed price guaranteed contract was now midterm being increased by a bit over after speaking to web chat support i was told that yes that is right and that they can increase the monthly charge even though it was sold as fixed price after extensive chat their solution was not to scrap the charge but instead to help me by trying to upsell me a more expensive deal highlighting the fixed price guarantee as if it was worth anything then a manager offers three months credit for the extra charge a charge that should not be at all now waiting for escalated complaint contact before i complain to ofcom i do not like being ripped off a fixed price contract is a contract they claim it is guaranteed yet hike when they want to they also state that the got permission to increase the price though quite who that permission was granted by is a mystery but implied that it was with ofcom something i find hard to believe avoid this supplier added after response maybe you would like to tell everyone just where in the contract it states that the guaranteed your price will not increase during your contract does it say that is totally meaningless and that you can break the terms of your contract any time you like yes it has been tough on firms but us too you should only be raising the price at the end of the contract period not before and only if you have too how can you sell a product with a guarantee that you will not charge more i signed up in large part due to the guarantee i am sorry but to do this is plain wrong and i will as i have had no contact from talktalk directly be making complaint to ofcom i hope they make you refund all and fine you a huge sum and now all you can say is yes its fine to break our contract so again i say it avoid this supplier,Bad
1805,i tried to connect with the customer impossible my sons phone is without network already one matter is on direct debit and is been regularly paid tried to connect with the customer service without any success,Bad
1806,purchased a black friday deal over the phone for the bigger tv broadband package with channels and bt sport once installed i discovered i had been given the the big package with only channels and no sports raised issue with virgin media who refused to give me the original package that i had been sold as they claimed i had no evidence of this i suggested that evidence could be provided by listening to my original phone call with the virgin sales agent who sold me the package i gave them the date and time of they call but they refused to listen to the call very unsatisfactory customer thanks for your response the second half of my message refers to a discussion i had with a member of the virgin media complaints team however they refused to look at any of our calls or notes and refused to let me speak to their manager all they did was offer us a new package which was worse than the original black friday package and worse than current online virgin media new customer packages which we could no longer access as existing customers we were left feeling as if our complaint wasnt taken seriously and they wouldnt accepted any of the evidence we presented,Bad
1807,worst customer service ive ever experienced moved house and was told virgin was not available in my new property even though several houses i know on the estate have it and the cables are through the estate and have a connection point outside my property was forced to cancel and charged over early disconnection fee was told its probably due to installation costs however apparently this is still a cost to me agent was rude and had zero customer service skills,Bad
1808,if you value your sanity do not sign up with this company attempted to sign up last night and the the computer rejected it for some reason the human agent on line was supposed to find to find why came back and insisted the only way to complete it was to send them a screen shot of personal private have now been on phone for an hour trying to find out the answer why if the computer system is holding incorrect information vm are legally obliged to correct it under the gdpr i have twice told them i wish to raise a sars request for this information they have ignored despite the act of asking being a legal form of request according to the information am being passed from to post sales to customer care back to customer etc where you then have the entire rigmarole of well i need a customer account number well of course i dont have one thats the entire problem there phone system is impossible to get to actually speak to an gent if you dont have an account number meaning you have to trick the menu system and end up at a completely random person its now been an hour and a half i have been bounced between customer care and sales about times ironically enough the help desk number i was given is for internal staff only i will be lodging a formal complaint with the information office in the morning,Bad
1809,why is ee triple the cost of sky and double the cost over years,Bad
1810,ee app not showing my data balance called up costumer service technical support times to no avail because they are useless so just change mobile provider in due course,Bad
1811,please find an alternative broadband provider to cant comprehend how companies as large as talktalk and are so inept and been without broadband for days now and they cant manage to book and engineer between them ive spent nearly hours on the phone over the last day and wasted half a day off waiting for an engineer not to turn upi only scored star as isnt urge you not to use talktalk,Bad
1812,untrustworthy sneaky people i got my broadband media and sim bundle from them last year they changed my contract without letting me know in december my sim was cancelled they ended up giving us another sim after much calls and arguments we asked for a spending cap but they didnt put it on after a few months called them again to find the reason for high bills and was told that theyve increased prices i asked for a spending cap again called them again this month to ask why theyre charging me so much again and they said its because i dont have a spending cap on theyre driving me crazy theyre unwilling g to take blame for their mistakes im paying the price of their bad customer services please learn from my mistake stay away from virgin get bt or sky instead virgin tv is substandard and the internet is always down,Bad
1813,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
1814,absolutely dreadful company wont let you cancel been trying for over a year now still fighting customer service are not helpful at,Bad
1815,the whole system is confused first texts to say that system is changing then repeat postal slips with no date when system changes nor its implications i have four phones from separate plugs around the house and it is totally unclear as to how many adaptors that i need and i can not understand why if i need more than one that i should have to pay for additional parts its bt job to make the system that they installed work not mine to buy additional bits until the changeover at some unknown future date i have no idea how it will operate so i give it one out of ten i am elderly and find this all confusing but why dont they just send an engineer round to fix it on the spot with what ever the new system needs,Bad
1816,given one star because zero is not allowed just counting the days to the end of my contract awful speed useless customer service just look for something different virgin media is simply not a credible internet service provider i pay for the best available speed and i hardly get mbs,Bad

1843,i currently have a samsung z fold which i received via an ee contract in october as this is a luxury phone i was paying per month which while expensive was manageable for me i was advised that the price increase in april would be i reached out in march to request for this to be discussed as paying this much for a phone is extortionate but they refused to discuss this and i therefore requested a letter of complaint to be sent out and passed to an ombudsman said letter didnt arrive until i sent an official complaint to ee in which it arrived upon second request i also mentioned in the complaint about a request to slightly reduce the price under preferably so a reduction per month i was responded to by a member of their executive customer resolution team via email who provided me with the following informationthis increase is in line with the terms of your contract your contract states that your price plan addons and charges will increase every year section in march by the rate of consumer price index cpi plus the increase will be calculated using the december cpi figure which is published in january of each year the increase this year is cpi plus totalling details about the annual cpi price increase are made clear at the point of sale and in any marketing material that contains pricing they have made it clear it is my fault for signing a contract for them and wont be making the same mistake as of october im counting the days until i can you decide to join ee as their actual service is good i would recommend purchasing your phone directly from the phone company samsung apple etc as opposed to via ee ee believe that the price of a phone increases in value over a year period as opposed to depreciating and will charge you for this as well as the sim mobile companies have similar plans for the mobile alone in which the price shall remain at a fixed rate similar to other financing options and the most ee will get is a couple of pounds increase in the simi have learned the hard way and hope that this message is a warning to others to not make the same mistake i ee service is good increase of cost including a depreciating phone is ridiculous get your phone from the mobile company and get a sim from ee or any other mobile responding to the response below from ee your company should only be charging an increase on the sim or on some sort of scale depending on how much your customer pays pushing my mobile bill up to digits per month for a phone that ive had for a year is not the right way to do business you had a customer for life paying for a phone and sim with you but at these extortionate prices the company is thinking about the short term with me your company could have kept me on for another year deal at per month and many more deals for years to come but instead shall be receiving an extra per month for months and then nothing not the right way to do business with a loyal content customer who was willing to pay extra for the luxury of a top brand phone and willing to pay extra getting the phone from you rather than direct from the supplier i have learned my lesson and hope that people heed the warning to never buy their handset from ee or any other company that follows in this practice,Bad

1871,received an email from talktalk this morning apparently my email address used since will be closed down unless i pay talktalk year or sign up for their currently on a month contract with another broadband provider so i cannot switch to talktalk so they are effectively saying they want year from me in return for not closing down my email address which is required for logging into all the other websites i use on the is straight extortion and utterly appalling you should be ashamed of i have seen the response from becky below that response is the monthly fee of is neither small nor good value i can get a microsoft exchange email box for under a month hosted by it is totally unreasonably to threaten closure of my email account at such short notice if i do not pay these new fees i need my email address for signing into nearly websites including my online banking gp government login etc these are not things i can afford to stop having access to the amount of time it will take me to change all these accounts will be hugely my email address is not a talktalk email address it is a email address that predated takeover of the terms and conditions back in the day of did not leave me exposed to having one of my main channels of communications shut has anyone at talktalk given a moments thought to the amount of wasted time this will cause people who were not necessarily even your customers to avoid paying your new fees the marginal cost of my email box will be a few pence per year to talktalk and you are asking me to choose between handing you a xx profit or waste hours of my time staggeringly selfish,Bad
1872,customer service is awful constant waiting seemingly no notes on the system as i had to explain over and over again constant promises of calling back broken not once did they call back though it was offered on occasions and after phone calls live chats and hold music over months when they resolved the issue an error on their behalf there was no offer of apology or even follow up call to see if it was dreadful avoid,Bad

1878,worst service with respect to billing poor calculation process and network speed they apply for the compensation for poor service slow speed when customer switched service and say you are being compensated and no refund is due and you have to pay the remaining amount due common i have switched still i need to checking many times they say final bill is not generated after chatting hrs and every customer care agent will tell you different company policy which are against your thinking looks like they are well trained to their mind to company benefit i did struggle for a month there were customer care agent i need to deal with and engineers visited but issue was not resolved and customer care agents tortured me like anything saying do this try this etc and all customer care agents done same thing no new thing when asked about the compensation for slow speed they applied it on next month bill where i have already switched to another service go for talktalk at any cost sorry forget to tell gift to join talktalk was also not given to me,Bad
1879,never go with they will rip you off totally,Bad
1880,its worse than bad i dont think such as virgin should not even be allowed to operate how is this possible how can your internet go down every two week and comes back after to days this is actually unbelievable i called several times and no resolution have been found i work from home and imagine telling my boss every two weeks that my internet is down after a few months he found it hard to believe each time i called and asked why there is a problem with the lines in my area but apparently its everywhere around its sad that is not what it use to be i had enough and i am moving to or even maybe talktalk i would not recommend to anyone and if you have sense then read the twitter comments under their posts and read all reviews then you will understand,Bad
1881,we have been without a landline for weeks now and have been in contact with talktalk all that time without resolve we are both in our s and my husband has suffered two strokes in the past few years so i am anxious that in case we need help and we will have no means of calling for it i do have a mobile phone and i used that to contact talktalk originally and in so doing i used up my monthly allowance we are not getting any help from talktalk i have requested an engineer without result they are asking all the time for verification of our account and the account holder which we have supplied each time but no joy with resolution,Bad

1885,sold inadequate equipment not fit for the purpose full of broken promises make telephone call appointments they fail to keep making a complaint is like trying to get into fort knox wish i hadnt joined talktalk and problems are still ongoing today heard from talktalk in reply to this review and and told to contact them via facebook so the can get me the proper equipment you have my contact details call me nobody is taken in by false promises that you put on social media edit is a poor excuse because nobody bothers even with details and calls to customers apparently arent an option somebody is supposed to be calling me tomorrow between watch this space as im still waiting for the one arranged on the st november,Bad
1886,just wasted an hour of my time what should have been a simple notification of moving home and starting new contract i couldnt even do neither online nor over the phone due to system issues why they couldnt just tell me that at the start instead of wasting so much of my time i have no idea,Bad
1887,im leaving to live abroad for a while so i wanted to cancel all my call virgin media and explain the situation im then asked if i have found a better repeat myself again only to be told that ive come through to the wrong dept and that they will have to transfer my calli speak to someone else and explain the situation once again im told ive come through to the wrong dept this happens four someone with half a brain cells finally understands what moving abroad close my account please means im slapped with every exit charge you can think may have fast broadband but thats not enough to convince me to come back to virgin upon my return absolutely awful service you should be embarrassed,Bad
1888,vodafone was once a great provider with uk based customer service who really cared now its robots in india who obviously dont give a damn keep adding charges and it takes ages to get anything sorted been with them for over years which apparently counts for nothing cant wait to see the end of the contract and move to o,Bad
1889,stay well away from sure tell you nothing but lies promised me the network they put me on was the best for me lost me a lot of money as signal and g coverage was very very poor and they didnt want to know,Bad
1890,absolutely the worse company to have a mobile contract with firstly the sim didnt arrive for over weeks and when it did my disappointment begun i switched over from three thinking o would be better but its worse the data barely connects or us so slow its pointless i mostly get error messages if i try to browse internet or open email i bought it for data primarily for nearly months i have had issues and when i contacted o which is so difficult and then have the misfortune luck of having to deal with the most useless people who are told me dont expect a service that works and that network is down as always they wont compensate for lack of service i am sure that they throttle the data service and entice you with packages portraying that you are going to get a good offer which is not he case i really want to cancel but dont want to be charged for early exit they take your money and for dont recommend o at all be warned,Bad
1891,i just love the rubbish that this company have come out with in their new tv adverts they state that they will not increase your tariff at any time during the duration of your contract even more unbelievable they have the cheek to state that if your tariff was increased by any service provider you can freely give notice and leave the contract without penalty funnily enough last year they increased my tariff half way through my contract i gave them days notice changed to vodafone who arranged all the swapping over which was seamless and i thought that would have been the end of my talk talk experience for the last months i am now constantly subjected to threatening calls and letters from talk talk and different debt collecting companies working on their behalf who are trying to have me pay an early termination fee which i am quite legal in refusing to pay as they changed the tariff without my agreement and i submitted a day notice of contract termination notice i have just discovered that they have black marked my credit score for non payment of this erroneous early termination fee that they have stated i owe i am now consulting with the ombudsman and i do intend to claim compensation from them as the stress and time i have had to spend while dealing with this as well as the damage caused to my credit rating due to their pure should not be allowed to happen to anyone this company have a well earned name as the worst reputation and customer care skills of any company they are a communication company who cannot communicate effectively due to every call being taken by overseas call operators who have substandard skills avoid all dealings with this company as you will not be treated well,Bad
1892,by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced i signed up to a contract in january and vodafone have continued to get my bill wrong every single month when i last spoke to their customer service team via the online chat feature it took them over hours to resolve my issue ive been lied to multiple times by management and have wasted hours of my time trying to resolve simple issues i am extremely unhappy with vodafone and will be escalating my complaint further,Bad
1893,terrible customer service ruins a decent internet service installation technicians that dont turn up lies and off by call centre staff very unpleasant bad reviews do not bother bt as theyre raking it in,Bad
1894,if i could give vodafone a zero i would this is honestly the worst company to do business with they make it impossible to cancel leaving you no choice but to cancel the direct debit you then receive threatening letters you cant pay online as system is always down so you have to call you then wait minutes every time ironically for a telecoms business they send you text msgs requesting feedback if you respond the messages bounce you honestly couldnt make it up how they still have a consumer facing proposition in market when there are companies like ee who answer the phone almost immediately deal with you like a human being and provided a great service to match come on ee either kill this business or buy this business its already dead,Bad
1895,if i could give a i would me and my partner have been with talk talk for over years now and weve had nothing but trouble firstly our internet wouldnt connect displaying a orange flashing light after contacting the call center and having to pull apart the connection box they decided to send a new router out which worked perfect for about weeks then it happened again after spending hours on a live chat to be cut off before any action was taken we decided to ring them which took over an hour so after hours of phone calls and live chats we asked for an to come out and was told if there was a problem caused by us we would be charged for service charges the came and was gob smacked with how eroded our connection box was due to it being so old we have now just discovered we have been charged for the service charge despite the problem not being our fault at all we wouldnt have known we had been charged if we hadnt have checked our online banking out of fluke they gave us no warning or even informed us money would have been taken out after all of this we asked for a refund for then taken from our account and money knocked off our next bill due to us not having internet access for over weeks which they declined doing either usually wouldnt bother us but due to the current pandemic we are all going through me and my partner are currently working from home so we rely on having internet access would not recommend stay away,Bad
1896,since we had fiber connected we have had problems tv buffers and emails time out errors so obviously its problems with talktalk sever all other site connect fast before up grading to this our old package worked fine they will not rectify this unless i agree to pay for an engineer to visit so think twice before anyone else upgrades,Bad
1897,awful company avoid kept charging me and ruining my credit file even after cancelling after end of contract absolute disgrace,Bad
1898,really not happy with the service i received from talk talk when i lived in my old property the speeds were never up to scratch when i left the property we lived in as we had purchased a house our trouble with really began times i have been on the phone to talk talk to try and resolve mistakes on their end because no ones listens i am absolutely sick of it ive moved house and taken broadband and tv with a different provider quicker than talk talk have dealt with me i get told one thing over the phone and then receive emails stating the complete opposite i was told there would be no cancellation fees as it was their mistake but now my bill states otherwise and ive had to call yet again just feel like im constantly being lied to and messed around absolutely disgraceful service,Bad
1899,broadband is not too bad as long as the device has is in view and within range of to metres as soon as you go behind a door or wall the connection freezes this is a sales ploy to make you upgrade to the package that guarantees wifi signal in each room they purposely give you a weak when is phoned to see what the problem was the customer service rep kept on rudely talking over me mid sentence they were full of glee letting me know i cant switch until july unless i were to pay an extortionate get out charge noted for life anyone else but bt,Bad
1900,great internet speed then rubbish tried to resolve it with a person based in a foreign country asked for an engineer to visit no luck im metres from an exchange box so its problem will not be renewing my contract with them you cannot actually speak to anyone their whole system is based on foreign call centres or referring you to trust pilot only wished i had read the reviews myself god only knows who wrote a good review might have been an employee,Bad
1901,horrendous customer service poor website and ridiculous useless chatbot having to deal with virgin was actually more than losing all our broadband,Bad
1902,genuinely one of the absolute worst customer services i have ever dealt with so incompetent and incapable its ridiculous will never ever use them ever again for anything at owe me for a product i never received and they dont dispute i didnt receive it they know i didnt from the delivery records and just trying to organise a refund they make it an absolute impossibility still no refund and they are so incompetent they cannot even organise like the plague,Bad
1903,very poor with them for years more through if finding another provider with fast bill went from up to managed to get them back down to which was service is poor never get anywhere near the max download speed wifi is very poor and the router keeps dropping out service cuts for no apparent reason and they constantly text to say they are carrying out essential work to improve service in our area but can never actually see the actually still waiting for an engineer visit that was booked just over a year ago i know traffic can be bad but just made the switch to hey broadband mbps for per month oh and the st months are free,Bad
1904,customer service online questions unable to be answered so really not great however i was assured by the following my skills are well equipped for tech and customer service unfortunately our order management team are not in today ie my question was for management team and not customer services really i would have thought someone well equipped in customer services could answer the question of when will our system be installed it appears not for a company in the field of online technology this is clearly sub optimal star was over generous as they only took from until to answer the question not exactly a rapid,Bad
1905,ive had no tv or internet for nearly a month useless,Bad
1906,very pathetic internet literally impossible to get a complaint raised if your internet is giving issues and you just have to keep struggling,Bad
1907,had no internet for months disconnect me without telling me then try to charge me over,Bad

1926,please do not use bt the product is what it is but the customer service team are rude and defensive their business model is market share so they really dont care if a customer leaves because another one will always replace them do your research and read the independent reviews online of their broadband mobile and landline services,Bad

1930,the order started off fine it went through with no problems broadband and telephone was set up as indicated by an open reach engineer no problems tv was due to be installed friday august and we were given an allotted time which was confirmed via letter several text messages email and automated telephone message however after waiting in for the engineer visit they phoned up to cancel at short notice and after the allotted time they explained unforeseen circumstances and offered to visit in the afternoon on tuesday august but they did not give a specific time slot i reluctantly agreed i then contacted customer service via online chat which i initiated sunday august at to seek further information about the engineer visit and also question why items that i did not order were included in my phone addons namely voicemail service which is now a charged service after supplying details and waiting about minutes i was told that my details were correct and that i will be transferred to the customer loyalty department a person then joined the chat who was also on the initial chat i know because i initiated a chat beforehand but exited shortly afterwards so either they use fake names which are generated from a pool of or there are fake departments approximately minutes elapsed before the new person from the customer loyalty department offered to help me they just needed to read through the previous chat consisting of a few sentences this took them over minutes after which they asked please give me minutes to read through the above chat it seemed like an eternity had passed since i initiated the chat actually over an hour but they finally offered to book an engineer visit however it was not on tuesday like i was told this time the earliest was in another weeks time is that ok they asked well what exactly are they asking is ok let me ask is it ok to have a customer wait in all day for a confirmed prearranged engineer visit only to have them call you up late afternoon to tell you they cant make it and so you are left without service is it ok to rearrange it for one day on the telephone and then when you contact customer service you are kept waiting over an hour to be told you now have to wait over another weeks time is it ok to have items added to your order that you didnt order and then there be no way to remove them from your account without first contacting the specialist customer loyalty its not ok i understand they say but the only available appointment ok please cancel the order i said i was then transferred to the cancellation team and the person who was on the first chat joined please call our dedicated customer service team on so lets recap the engineer cancels at short notice after the allocated time slot has elapsed i get a new day of visitation i contact customer service to confirm the time slot and remove the unwanted voicemail service after waiting about minutes im transferred to someone else i wait over a further minutes to be told the only available appointments contrary to what i have been previously told are in another weeks time i explain again they copy and paste the same reply and ask is that ok im not happy so i ask to cancel they transfer me to yet another person the same person from the first chat they tell me to contact them by phone not enough that i wasted over an hour chatting already they want me to take time out of my day tomorrow to contact them by phone ha chat then terminated without at one hour and minutes after initiation i have to say i have received absolutely shocking service so far the order hasnt even been completed yet so unfortunately im left with no choice but to cancel because the order has been negated therefore i would advise against being a customer of talktalk,Bad
1931,useless totally utterly will call you and never do we will do better at service and this was a one off even though its consistently crap day to day from management to the person who cleans their of them totally utterly ridiculously useless breathing is probably difficult and the fact they manage to say phone is an accomplishment in i am beyond dealing with moronic children are there any internet providers that professionalism and basically doing your damn job talk talk virgin and sky can all stay quiet as its already known your equally useless,Bad

1954,i have had an account with for years and they recently contacted me with a request to change my login arrangements for online access i subsequently could not logon and when i contacted them it appears my details do not not match with their records unsurprisingly the direct debit details seem to be ok i am concerned that their security and data protection controls are not up to the job of protecting my personal details the fact that nobody seemed particularly concerned suggests this is an everyday occurrence,Bad
1955,spoke to an agent called amanda no help at all she put me on hold times occasions when she didnt even need to the woman couldnt pronounce my name correctly even after correcting her every single time why attempt to say my name when you are being corrected multiple times its not even hard its mahima also she didnt resolve my issue and instead filled out a complaints form which she read to me but had no key information included on absolutely useless wasted minutes on the phone to a useless agent great customer service o,Bad
1956,i would swerve this lot if i were you if my experience is anything to go bought a mobile from their ealing broadway shop about four years ago the staff were professional helpful and polite and i was always happy with the phone being a light user i only made relatively few calls with even fewer texts i recently had it stolen and rang customer services to get it blocked and get a refund on the balance transferred onto a new get this refund i had to answer a few security questions asked by people who were clearly not paid to think i rang three times hoping i would succeed i failed the test miserably each time the kind of questions were firstly i was asked for the sim number which of course was on the phone however i was told it would also be on the box the phone came in but i had thrown this away ages ago secondly i was asked who i texted most frequently i replied that i am a light user and very rarely texted anyone and could not remember the last time i did it i did say that i could remember who i last texted but it would have been some time ago wrong answer thirdly i was asked how much credit was left on the phone i said it was about but as i no longer had the phone i could not be more precise and was unable to ring up and find out the thief might also have made a few calls and sent a few texts before i had the phone blocked to which i was not of course privy this was to me a daft question does anyone know their precise then decided to go back to the shop where i had bought the phone to see if i could be more successful there it had moved but was still in ealing broadway i was attended to by who at first seemed quite positive but he then had to call the same customer service and i was then put through the same hoops around the same time he was having a conversation with one of his colleagues about whether they had had lunch or not he left me while i went through the same inappropriate security questions which i again failed miserably it then appeared that had actually gone to lunch while i was still on the phone i then had to talk to someone else whose name i did not catch but who was arrogant and rude i tried to explain the line of questioning was inappropriate but he stopped me and demanded i listened to him i wanted to explain that i would still be happy to buy another phone if i could get one with the same light user deal however i never got the chance as it was clear he wanted to get me out of the shop he parted with a very sarcastic merry to if you want to retain customers please come up with some sensible security questions that take account of all customers i cant help noticing a lot of rather negative reviews here though different from mine must be doing very well if it can upset so many people or maybe it is not doing so well due to staff like and his colleague i hope he enjoyed his lunch he would probably have succeeded in selling me another phone if he had wanted fortunately has a lot of competitors out there,Bad

1972,worst broadband provider in the uk people on our local facebook group are always complaining about intermittent problems with virgin and we are with them at the moment though about to switch to and have our own negative views of the service they are always upping the prices as they claim it will make the service faster but there is no noticeable difference the service is unreliable as it has more frequent national outages than any other broadband and they are always doing maintenance without warning disconnecting customers from the digital world for half an hour bad customer service too yesterday it was off pretty much all day and not much different today to be fair they were obviously doing maintenance but tried to deny it and say it was a problem on our end also they dont keep on top of modem upgrades yesterdays experience was what pushed us over the edge with virgin and we really dont recommend it,Bad

1976,i am getting a lot of drop outs during the day the internet is not stable its been like this for months i am not happy with the service,Bad
1977,i have had broadband with virgin medias national service for nearly months now not once has my broadband speed gone above mbps however was reassured when i took it out it would be between and mbps have made countless complaints and keep being off with were looking into it have tested for the last weeks it has been between and mbps have complained the best they can do is tell me to keep testing they cant do anything without a diagnostic test however my internet speed is too low to complete the test only when i kicked up such a huge fuss that this was unacceptable did they say they would raise a call ive now got to wait working days for a text message to inform me what they are going to do about the problem will be cancelling asap and switching never going to use virgin again rubbish customer service disgusting broadband speeds awful company will demand a refund,Bad
1978,supposedly fibre one service so high speed fibre broadband but performing worse that my dial up connection over years ago trying to upload videos to youtube is taking hours and rendering the entire house tech useless for hours while i try spoke to them over the phone to book an engineer and miraculously started to work perfectly while they claimed to reset the system their end and now a few days down the line and completely useless againi do not believe this is fibre broadband and i will now be requesting to see proof of fibre installation in our area it should not be taking hours plus to upload a minute video to youtube,Bad
1979,please dont get talktalk i run a of employees then need access to the internet to be able to work talktalk could not give a st havent even emailed me since its been days my staff have to now work at home worst service you could possibly imagine,Bad
1980,they cancelled my phone line without any explanation i have an oomph package that includes phone and broadband and its set on direct debit it took them over two weeks to fix the problem and they didnt even offer any type of compensation i had to spend money on a different company to solve the problem they created,Bad
1981,i wish i can give star unfortunately theres no start,Bad
1982,new customers get a better deal than the old a minute call to discover that the loyalty team cannot offer prices listed on the website to an out of contract existing customer frustrating illogical and unacceptable,Bad
1983,i was sold a premium broadband package with a matching price tag the service is patchy the signal comes and goes several times a day sometimes for an hour or so i cannot rely on it for work started missing important meetings and appointments it is simply not good enough,Bad
1984,talktalk are by far the worst company in the uk how they are still operating is beyond me we had the service for months we were told our broadband would be mps what we actually received were speeds of mps or sometimes even kbps our telephone line was literally crackling constantly and they kept charging me over the odds for this rubbish service now they want quid off me for leaving early no way they breached their contract with me so in no way are they getting any more money out of me they dont listen to your concerns the customer advisors can not speak proper english and i could not understand them i have now changed to italk and im having a proper internet service which is what i should have had with talktalk please avoid this company save yourself the stress of being ripped off,Bad
1985,not a trustworthy customer service members,Bad
1986,update somehow this is still ongoing and i am yet to microwave my head out of frustration give me a cheer for my self control there is now an outage in my area which appeared after i said i wanted to withdraw within my legally permitted cooling off period and i must wait until tomorrow and it will all be fixed funny no im off the worlds worst customer service i am trying to order a wifi booster because i somehow get mbps in the room where the router is given that the cable has been installed in a random bedroom wall and nowhere useful and mbps in the room perhaps my walls are made of concrete uranium and kryptonite i have been through the chat multiple times which insists on routing me through a hundred support options which arent relevant to the issue in the desperate hope of making a customer go away in frustration i have called up and had the automated system refuse to let me speak to anyone and hang up on me instead i have had to demand to open a complaint as the customer service agent i eventually got to speak to was trying every way to get out of it only to get an email saying we agreed a resolution which included an apology to me we definitely didnt agree that and virgin definitely didnt apologise to me either the only positive of this experience is learning that my flat walls must be so thick theyll survive a nuclear war and that ai systems will never manage to take over the world if theyre as bloody awful as these ones are,Bad
1987,driven to write as my call with a senior manager promised with a reference case number has been closed apparently i am having a fourth installation this has been a time consuming poorly executed poorly organised event i think i would be extremely helpful to a senior manager as there is not one part that has gone well i can put it simply under to engineer communication each time i have placed the order i have given my mobile and been told that you get a call an hour before i have then asked for it clearly at the top to call me one hour before this does not happy they dont bother or one engineer showed me he had none of that information on his visit poor customer service quite unhelpful and not very services i rang three weeks ago to ask if all the account could be put under one umbrella so i could get into an account and all four properties would be listed there for me to download my accounts i found out the day before when i needed that information that it never got to the back office and was never activated therefore when they called me i failed security because i still cant access one of the addresses they asked if i wanted to spend a second hour doing up all the accounts from the beginning as they insist during the sales call for direct debits found out after the call which i failed security on and went back into the one account i can access that payments are well overdue got through only to find out that they have all bank details but they have to physically add them to the account to activate them so my credit rating has probably now been affected so we paid off everything we owe and had another go and getting them activate the bank details they have been holding for the last couple of day had another call and went through the same disastrous security questioning which has multiple layers and finally she accepted answers to different questions took another minutes to tell me my payments which had been confirmed the day before had gone throughthe complaint that is in where they agreed i could speak to a senior manager has just been closed according to the email and sorted out still waiting virgin media business what an absolute shambles your company is,Bad
1988,i had the misfortune to have virgin media at my last house they promise a lot but deliver very little they seem very friendly when you sign up they promise everything but deliver very little the customer service is annoying being passed on the phone from department to department and ending up speaking to the person you spoke to first it took six weeks to get the broadband installed and in the end it was costing so much that i scrapped it before the contract was finished,Bad
1989,in a nutshell talktalk keep asking me for money i dont owe them and do not have any customer services for me to talk to about it longer version i set up an account with talktalk for a flat i was going to move into before the outbreak the lockdown meant that my move was cancelled so i had to cancel my new account well within the day cooling off period unfortunately talktalk dont have customer services they just have a desolate pit where hope goes to die in the course of two weeks trying every day i managed to get through to actual human beings twice both humans assured me that theyd closed my account and that i wouldnt need to pay anything in the meantime i was getting calls from engineers to say there were at my flat to set up the broadband and id have to apologise and let them know that no one lives at the flat and that i cancelled account in the past couple of weeks i started getting bills from talktalk for the account which they said they closed twice good thing i cancelled my direct debit again trying to speak to someone to explain that i dont have an account with talktalk is impossible its like watching yourself slowly ageing and moving towards the grave the online chat function is offline the customer services phone number just gives you a prerecorded message saying something like hahahaha you fool now youll never escape and then hangs up there is no way to email anyone i made the mistake of trying to contact them over twitter meaning i get a message in my inbox every few days from a different person asking me what the problem is exactly because they dont have the ability to scroll up do not go with talktalk dont even make eye contact with them you will never be able to escape their slimes cold tentacles learn from my mistakes,Bad
1990,disgusting company to deal with their ceo doesnt even have the courtesy to acknowledge an email after hours and their social media team cant pass a message on wow is all i can are leaving my mum without a functioning tv service,Bad
1991,has all sorts of issues moving house the best one being the booklet with the number you need to call to connect being not recognised a telecom co that do not know their own phone one is that the mbps service is actually mbps chat is not available no email is provided to and the automated no tells you it will reset all your equipment to try to fix the issue why do they want to reset the tv box to fix the router why when my other half is watching her favourite programme so basically no way to contact vm even via email today dancing to vms timetable again and getting fed up an email to be sent at my leisure and dealt with within limits vms leisure would be perfect now i need to find time while working tomorrow to sit in a call queue,Bad
1992,despicable customer service people who are like sitting ducks bureaucracy is disgusting they toss you from one person to the of command far below internet on my premises was switched off while claiming someone requested the broadband to be transferred to another provider this was not initiated from my premises is now left vulnerable to burglary police called on premises this morning to report an attempted burglary by concerned neighbours into my my intruder alarm till machine computers cameras monitoring cameras monitored by external agency are all rendered useless staff sitting down not been able to do calls have been made to bt with meaningful progress other than someone is looking into frustrating number contact number,Bad
1993,wifi signal is not reliable i need to reconnect my phone constantly because wifi just cuts off and i know for sure nothing wrong with my phone also i was to sign new months contract with virgin my ex tenants had to move and virgin couldnt provide service at the new address virgin acted very aggressive and imposed penalty charge i thought it was unfair and decided to help my tenants by taking over the remaining of contract virgin for some reason couldnt do it and the only way to sort it out was to sign new contract they left me no choice once the contract is over im out and will never have virgin ever contract expired and has been canceled virgin still charged me for a month upfront someone from customer service promised to refund my money but only after one month why i have to wait for one month this is unauthorized interest free loan total daylight robbery,Bad

1995,i have been in touch with customer service staff spent hours on the telephone and writing and i have got absolutely nowhere three people in my local shop the ones that caused the problem are helpless in sorting it out it would be interesting to know what all these customer service staff are paid to do it ends up as a pass the parcel exercise and you go from one to another of their staff and you have to explain the whole thing over is an absolute farce and in this day and age totally unacceptable either no one gives a damn or they are so badly trained or they dont understand the system that they are worse than useless why employ them if they cannot give the answers i would suggest that the mobile phone administrative system may be so complicated that it is beyond the staffs latest was a call from shah at pm on th september he wanted my date of birth what is that to do with anything i also had to supply proof that i had topped up my pay as you go account which had been obliterated by vodafone i emailed that shah said he would phone the following day at am i told him i would not be home he said he would phone on sunday however he did phone on the day i was out and left a number for me to ring him number not recognised my husband deduced that i should have used the code for india unbelievable needless to say i was not about to throw more money at vodafone which it looks as though i will never get back,Bad
1996,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
1997,shocking customer service false promises false fixes thats if you get to talk to human internet is constantly routers and engineer visits later still not fixed stick to bt i will be going to them once my contract is up,Bad
1998,if i could give stars i worst wifi provider i have ever experienced and the customer service is an absolute will spend weeks being passed from department to department of people who havent got a clue just to go around in circles until you choose to stop the process through will be tied into a contract that you cant escape due to a ridiculously low minimum advice do your homework avoid at all costs if possible,Bad
1999,i was a mobile phone customer for many years and i wanted to switch my broadband so i decided to give vodafone a try from day they never had steady download speeds i was paying for the up to mbps download speed with a guaranteed minimum of mbps every evening i was being throttled down to speeds of to mbps i spent many nights on the phone for sometimes hours doing speed tests trying this trying that nothing seemed to work and the next night different operator same process they just didnt seem to know what they were doing or talking about keeping me on hold for half the time while they went to find out they also made certain statements during the sign up process which turned out not strictly true they didnt tell me the full picture this is regarding them buying out my previous providers contract they said my account would be credited the amount of remainder of my previous contract and it would automatically come off my first bill when the bill came out this was not the case i phoned them and a different person said no you have to fill in an online application to get that something they failed to tell me when i was deciding to sign up also the wifi signal from their router is terrible it does not reach me in me front garden not even meters away with only a window in between my previous providers router which was nearly years old might i add its wifi signal reached half way down the street i eventually cancelled my contract because i was still within the day period where i could cancel and i couldnt be bothered with it anymore for the sake of your sanity do not sign up for this you will regret it i will never get back the many hours i wasted trying to get sorted what they were supposed to deliver in the first place,Bad
2000,my oap dad was a loyal customer for over years he then moved supplier virgin then tried to charge him extra when he left tried to charge him for the broadband box etc bunch of money grabbers avoid,Bad
2001,i just renewed my broadband service because i feel i have to the way they treat customers is appalling as a loyal customer i dont get any of the deals new customers do each year the tiny extras like free bt sport get taken away i dont get an upgraded bt hun even though im paying more than new customers for the same service and when a newer hub could give me better performance this is a joke basically you have to go elsewhere then come back as a new customer to get one this year they charged me for caller display when it was meant to be free when i asked for a refund i was told it was my fault for not checking my bill and that i had somehow accepted paying by doing this which is complete rubbish almost mins later of being on the phone and knowing how things work legally they agreed to one year refund out of two i could have gone further with this but just couldnt be bothered the only reason i renewed is because i find when you have problems with a new internet provider you are left having to navigate issue between bt and the new provider which is a total nightmare so im staying with them to avoid the hassle make sure you check your bills because they think they can slap on extra charges whenever they feel like and then its your fault if you dont notice having a monopoly on the phone lines is disgusting and the only reason they are getting away with it and the only reason they have my custom i was treated appallingly as a person that renewed their contact who they make from each month,Bad
2002,the mobile data signal is a disaster lately,Bad
2003,if your thinking of joining ee i wouldnt bother they just lie through there teeth to get you to sign up once your signed up they dont care i would strongly suggest looking elsewhere as i will be doing,Bad
2004,if i could give them a i would do the website to pay for my mobile tariff is nonexistent but i am able to pay for the handset last month i thought i was paying for the tariff bill but i wasnt it was for the handset now i can only receive calls but not able to phone anyone i explained to the phone jockey that i am disabled and if i need to phone my friends i cant i spent a good hour to explain that i paid the wrong bill and i can pay for it on friday they didnt give a hoot about my circumstances and i am stuck with a brick the billing website is diabolical you can get a bill up and pay for the mobile phone itself but you cant pay for the tariff beware of this crap company nobody cares about the customer only the money that rolls in,Bad
2005,if i could give no stars i would numerous requests to change tariff or add services i am told they will be done but nothing happens completely inefficient i am charged for services i dont receive extremely poor service,Bad
2006,i have been with virgin media for many years enduring constant poor non existent customer service interrupted internet service periodic loss of telephone and television service since september i have suffered daily from interrupted internet service my constant calls for help to the customer service team fall on deaf ears as i am told as a matter of fact the issues are simply due to the upgrades occurring in the area and it will benefit me in the long run it is now pm and my entire street virgin media customers only have been without television and internet for hours i have been told by virgins so called customer care team that it will be another hours before any further updates will be given my only internet access is now through that which is provided by my mobile phone company i do not know how companies like virgin get away with providing such poor service to their customers it is wholly unacceptable although it means little to them i have now terminated my contract with virgin i now look forward to when my day notice period is at an end if more customers walked away from virgin due to their poor service and an uncaring customer service team perhaps then we will see virgin making marked improvements for now as long as customers suffer in silence and pay their hard earned cash for a less than adequate service virgin will continue to be insensitive to their customers and treat them with total disregard,Bad
2007,i dont have anything constructive about this its just dog ping all the time worst wifi brand ever wish i stuck with sky at least i can play a game,Bad

2010,similar to other reviews i tried to register a payment card online it would not let me do this internal server error however i could make payment for a online which i did unfortunately whilst money was taken from my bank account asda did not top up my phone i subsequently managed to make a top up over the phone i have therefore paid twice for the same airtime i have spoken to customer services who could not help and advise me to email them with evidence which i did part of the asda reply to my emails says that they have no record of an online payment my response has been of course you dont because your online payment system is broken the other part of the asda reply is to speak to customer services it is only a small amount that i am out of pocket but i am prepared to keep going round in circles until i get my money back,Bad
2011,i have been with o for over years now asked about an upgrade given my options as a new customer i can get a better deal through o than been a loyal customer for over years even worse as a new customer going to carphone warehouse i can get a better deal through them than o and thats on an o tariff through carphone warehouse come on o your not doing very good,Bad

2017,star is too much it took weeks for broadband to be set up i did not see when signing up there was a maximum upload speed which is as i had only saw the minimum download speed guaranteed we cannot connect to our hive thermostat because it needs a minimum upload speed of when i had initially contacted talk talk i was promised that this would be fixed no changes so i contacted for the rd time and was told that there is nothing wrong with our internet speed and we should upgrade anyways i saw online that fibre was now available in our area month after signing up i contacted the upgrade team who said that its not possible for me to switch they are basically only signing up new customers,Bad
2018,just joined o and they are very quick to take your money but dont want to refund when its time to do so i really wont recommend thier services and wish i wasnt tied to thier mths contract worst mistake made with my sim only deal,Bad

2024,i try not to write negative reviews on trustpilot but i dont even know where to start with talktalk our internet went down thursday morning and i tried to diagnose the issue myself by replacing cables restarting the modem and router and testing the socket prior to calling unfortunately there was still no luck with the connect so i resorted to contacting customer support since thursday i have had no internet and engineer appointments that have been booked and within minutes subsequently cancelled on friday morning my wife and i waited all morning for someone to arrive before eventually contacting talktalk support to be told that the appointment had been cancelled after minutes of speaking to support i was then informed that the issue related to the exchange and this would be resolved within hours i waited and there was no update on saturday morning i contacted talktalk support again via twitter and my wife spend hours going through the most mundane and scripted diagnosis process ive ever seen including have you tried turning it off and on again every time we contact talktalk were subject to the same diagnosis process what model of master socket do you use have you tried turning it off and on again the modem is essentially a computer blah blah blah though i can understand there are customers who may not be aware their modem is plugged into the wall ive been upfront and provided detailed diagnostic information to talktalk on every occasion only to go through the same basic process yesterday we managed to get talktalk to book an engineer appointment minutes later i received a text message to ask how my experience was with the engineer this text is sent out automatically to customers when theyre appointment is marked as complete i contacted talktalk through their web chat to ask if the appointment was still going ahead and the guy assured me it was definitely still happening at the exact same time my wife asked the same question on twitter and was told by ram it was cancelled the same company told us conflicting information minutes apart i am absolutely sick and tired of sitting in my house losing money unable to conduct business because you clearly have some kind of internal issue which means you cant communicate with each other effectively this is my last resort for some sort of i did as asked below and neither the community or anyone on twitter has replied cant believe the service its the worst ive ever experienced,Bad

2028,dont answer the phone and when you do get on a live chat if the agent cant be bothered to help you they put you back to the bot who resets the chat back to the original questions,Bad
2029,absolutely appalling company sent my contract and bills to a random strangers email he in turn contacted me to confirm he had all my personal information to this day i have never received a contract took over an hour to get through to a call centre tried to cancel contact but because i was a few days over the day cancellation period i was told it would cost me and then to add insult to injury i was charged almost for the call i eventually got a letter telling me this was a minor breach of data protection what a joke of a company please just go with any other company but virgin after leaving this review i was contacted by virgin after hrs of messaging there were no apologies just confirmation that they would make a charge of absolutely refused to call me must be the most incompetent communication company in existence,Bad
2030,very quick to sell you a phone on webchat prices are very high,Bad
2031,sad to see what this company has become i have been a customer for years and it has been hassle free for most of it but the last years or so my god they are now absolutely appalling minimum hour to get through every time which you can learn to live with but its painful to know that you are patiently awaiting the big every time literally every time i call they dont want to know any of it took them months and hour after hour of calls to fix my broadband their internal departments dont have a line of communication to each other so you need to go on hold again if the person cant help you spent hours on one call recently just issue after issue my problem is that its difficult for me to get sky where i live or id be with them called today as im not getting broadband in an important area of my house after another hour getting through they said they dont have boosters in stock which is fine but they cannot put you on a list to send out when they get them in out of their capabilities it seems so itll be another hours call in a month again to see if they have them or not in the meantime im paying them a month for a service that doesnt work properly an utter shambles of a company now,Bad
2032,been with ee for many years service and price on but how on earth can you justify an price rise on top of last years price rise you are taking the ps out of loyal customers i agree prices have increased globally but of within the last months months left on my current business contract phones and bye bye ee disgrace and just pure greed so short sighted,Bad
2033,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
2034,virgin media ensured that its impossible to cancel their services ive been calling messaging with them on whatsapp for the last days on whatsapp you can expect a reply every hours every time you speak to someone on the phone they cant hear you despite being sat in a silent home with bars of signal and when they finally give up on this pitiful game the real fun begins you cannot convince them that you want to leave them broadband is a basic need they say trying to explain that someone else in the household has managed to secure a better deal under their name so you no longer need this account makes the phone operators react like this is the first time they have heard of such a thing in an instance when i was connected after been on hold for minutes the gentleman started lecturing me about having an attitude something im sure he would have said to a man and when i was borderline begging him to disconnect my broadband after attempting to do so for days straight worst consumer service ever ive never been so tired and upset,Bad
2035,absolutely shocking service we have been without working broadband for two weeks now called several times waiting for between to mins promised to get it fixed and let down time after a compliant and was closed down by virgin media suggesting the problem is now would not recommend them for anything and if i was their ceo or a shareholder i would be very concerned where is the accountability,Bad
2036,tv was bundled into my broadband for free i never used it and in march the free period ended incurring costs of per month i have been trying to get it cancelled ever since however when trying to do this via the website the site errors the closest ive come getting this done over the phone is getting through to someone who can increase my tv package but not reduce it they then put me in a queue for another department which do not answer the phone not matter how long you wait i appreciate there will be a degradation of customer service due to but to completely remove the ability to cancel a service and carry on charging for it can not be legal,Bad
2037,internet strength really bad customer service really bad fob off all the time leaving asap,Bad
2038,after months of poor quality picture quality countless visits from engineers and tech guys i am finally at my breaking point virgin promise high quality tv but at no point do i receive this as the continuous or breaking up of the picture from your end is unacceptable you charge very high fees and have never been able to resolve this issue i am also now receiving poor broadband where i am loosing connectivity to have me tied down to a contract which you ie virgin media are not fulfilling your end of the contract please contact by telephone so that we can discuss this worrying issue if you do not make any effort within the next couple of days i will be seeking legal advice on how to resolve semple,Bad

2041,i made a complaint then sat for hours waiting for a call guess what nothing happened they sent me an email and closed the complaint what a service complaints are dealt with within hrs if you have a choice dont go with virgin according to all my neighbours we have the same issue virgin are adamant they are not at fault funny how can so many people on the same block have the same issue with speed and have been telling them about these issues for years and so have the rest on my street,Bad
2042,in the beginning it was all rainbows and butterflies now every time i look at my phone i get the same feeling when you know youve stood in dog poo so g was great meg when i started with ee but now id be lucky to signal at all constantly getting text messages saying ive got a voicemail when my phone didnt even ring to begin with on top of that i got roped into getting there home broadband they said that if i got their home broadband to they would give me a monthly gig data allowance on my mobile contract i think most people would say yes to that anyway for months tried getting my gig data allowance and they wouldnt have it they said they only ever offer gig even after i sent them their email confirmation saying i would get gig their home broad band is pile of rubbish too connection constantly dropping and always phoning them up about it in summary they are simply rubbish,Bad
2043,i bought premium whole wifi discs i installed two discs to give it a try and this was quite easy unfortunately that was when the problems started the main disc which was wired to the router kept continually dropping necessitating constant reboots the secondary disc was placed in a location that was originally considered good but then also started dropping and not connecting to the primary discs gave up after days and am sending the whole lot bt finally responded to my review weeks later pity they did not read it first,Bad

2048,had to give star as unable to give customer service is appalling i have been on live chats for just under an hour to get a simple thing done,Bad
2049,i have been with vodafone for day only and it was a mayhem my next months bill was showing double system error minutes spent on chat i called to request a quote i wanted to upgrade from sim only to months contract with the phone assistant said please stay on line while i am checking seconds after my account has been deactivated and deleted system error i informed cs via chat another minutes spent they promised to bring it back within hours never happened so i spent another hour getting that sorted with promise next day i will be back online i have lost my patience and moved to o even then called vodafone to give them chance to rectify issues a lot of waiting until they pull my details no executive decisions nobody knows whats going on not a single moment that i felt individual approach here comes the best when i called with last chance call after another minutes on the phone agent explained they will call me back with best offer a bit sarcastic i said but you dont have my number it has been disconnected by system error dont worry sir i will write it down before end of call please stay on line minutes after they confirmed they will ring me back but never asked for new number i didnt bother to give this was my day with vodafone,Bad
2050,probably easiest if i paste my complaint to these scammers so you can see what they are am writing to complain about your sales practices as i have been one of your products and as a result will need to pay more than the advertised price over the lifetime of my contract it will be my last contract with virgin since being with your company in one form or another since it was blue yonder it is dishonest and illegal to advertise the price of your services without vat and without any symbol by the price to indicate that caveats apply and link to a clause furthermore it is even more dishonest that your sales personnel do not let customers know that vat is not included when purchasing a plan i spoke with several sales people before signing up to my current plan and it can not be a coincidence that none of them informed me of the exclusion of vat when we discussed prices and when the terms were read to i have discovered this after the day cooling off period and i assume the waiving of my first bill and sending me details to the facility where i may see my first bill after this point was to facilitate this its extremely disappointing and worrisome that i have been told that the equivalent of the vat will not be refunded to me despite my now having to pay for an amount i never agreed now spoken with others about this i see this is a common tactic as is the i was charged for a paper bill despite not asking for paper have also just tried to enter for the first time and although the dashboard showed my details my account settings showed another customers details this is bad enough but how do i know you are not leaking my details to others as was a very happy customer for years with virgin home but towards the end of my time with virgin home i felt devalued as a customer and hoped that switching to virgin business may be better it is not at alli have taken screenshots of all instances i can find where you are advertising your packages in a misleading way and i will be using this evidence to report your practices to the asa and trading another thing that shocked me is that there is a day cancellation period so if you are also one of their customers and want to leave as i do you may want to set a calendar reminder for months before the end of your contract,Bad
2051,very bad customer service contacted the customer services lots of time and not even sorting the reccomend virgin any more,Bad

2064,i have had a catalogue of problems with vf going back to late september i have made every effort to sort the problems out which is more than i can say for them i have spent so much time on this mile round trips to nearest shop and spending literally hours on the phone where i get passed round from person to person who promise to sort things out i have explained until i am blue in the face my stress levels are through the roof and i am pulling my hair out over what to do next one operator called tracey promised to pass me to the back room team who were dealing with my problems a complete lie which was admitted by the next person i spoke to glyn who told me there was no way to transfer me to this team and tracey had lied to me however he also let me down badly after keeping me on the phone for an hour and a half and promising to call me back after hours another lie this is the third time i have been made a promise to be called back and each time i am let down i have just had taken from my bank account when my two phones should only have been plus some calls made abroad certainly not amounting to that figure both phones have been put on the wrong price plan even glyn confirmed this when he looked through my notes and saw the price i am supposed to be paying i am totally at a loss where to go from here i feel i am lied to just to get me off the phone i refuse to give up but i think it will be the death of me,Bad
2065,run out of people to complain to about the health and safety department as the complaints department are equally useless at resolving a problem their choice of communication is just to ignore the complaint at any level,Bad

2080,do you really want to know the details of my experience of this execrable company probably not are customer services deliberately instructed to lie and defraud their customers i dont know if you are foolish enough to give them your custom then you may be able to answer this question yourself will i or any of my friends or family be dealing with vodafone again i would rather eat my own spleen bye vodafone i am now off to find the pink yorkshire bigfoot or one of your satisfied former looks favourite by a long shot,Bad

2082,to whom it may concern in january i called advisers to arrange my conversion from a year contract to pay as you go i have kept records of these conversations having unsuccessfully tried to sell me further products transfered me to pay as you go on th february however you continued to bill me on th february for the contract which had already been confirmed as called again on the th february when an adviser explained i would receive a full refund within weeks no refund has been issued i would imagine the interest made by on money held in this fashion from a large number of customers must constitute a very substantial profit for the company not to mention those customers who do not realise they have been incorrectly billed a very very poor financial service at best a deliberate and illegal charge at worst please refund my money straight away and without delay if it causes a charge due to my account being overdrawn i will be pursuing reimbursement for this too once you have reimbursed me please ensure you cancel the direct debit which i was advised to leave open to enable the reimbursement that did not bateman,Bad
2083,a simple query turned into a complaint my main issue i went abroad in january and wouldnt be returning until august my month contract had finished and i was now paying per month i didnt want to be paying per month whilst not being able to use their services while i was abroad i emailed via the complaints web form as it was the only way to email them to ask if my account could be frozen until i return to the ukthe ask if i would like to be emailed back or called back so i chose email i wouldnt be able to receive any calls whilst im abroad i got an automatic reply saying they received my email and i would get a reply i also explained this clearly in the email not to call me by phone and to use email only i never received any replies i chased this up several times and still never got a reply a while later they sent me a letter saying they tried to call me but was unable to reach me so the matter will be closed they obviously didnt read information i provided on their due to the time difference here i was able to connect to their live chat service in the evening to ask the same enquiry their live chat is just as bad after explaining to them my enquiry they responding saying they were looking into it they eventually came back to me saying they cant freeze my account and then gave me a link something to do with moving house and that i should speak to moving house team i realised that it didnt apply to me i connected to their live chat again the following day to change my package to the cheapest package which is still expensive whilst im abroad the chat lasted two hours because he tried to set me up on another month contract i kept explaining that i only needed a rolling contract i had to repeat myself several times it turns out that we got disconnected and i didnt realised until he told me he was a different agent he didnt even bother reading the conversation to get up to speed so i ended repeating myself again two hour chat that could have easily have been completed in less than minutes on a separate note i had an issue with and their customer service resolved my enquiry instantly in conclusion if you contact virgin media by email or live chat they dont read your enquiry they slow and unresponsive also i was on the m broadband package i never once got their advertised speed i tested the speed by only connecting the router to one device my desktop computer using an ethernet cable i tested the speed a few times i got about half of the advertised speed i never complained about the speed because it was still fast enough,Bad

2088,i recently ended my contract with virgin media only to find out that the price had doubled when i informed them of my decision to switch to another provider they provided me with a termination date however a few days later i received a call from them offering me a deal which i declined the next day they offered me a better deal which i also declined despite my refusals they continued to call me with more offers until they miss understood me and opt me in one due to their pushy tactics overall my experience with their user support was poor ie if you optin with them there will be a challenge to,Bad

2096,if you dont review your existing contract youll end up paying way above the odds when you chat online expect to be bounced into a new contract which may not suit your needs so do your homework customer loyalty there not interested,Bad
2097,our internet had gone down yet again for the rd time that week was told that it was going to be up working within hours this is not ideal when husband is working from home asked for a call back from the team this has never happened still waiting for this call paying for a service which is absolutely dreadful,Bad
2098,internet constantly going down and does not cover the whole house as promised,Bad
2099,after cancelling our contract due to numerous periods without internet and then virgin raising their prices above inflation virgin have illegally signed us up to a new contract without our consent when we called to query why we were still being charged months after our cancellation date we were told that we have been signed up to a new month contract by one of their retention call centres in india we had been hounded by calls for weeks after cancelling and told them very firmly that we did not want to change our make matters even worse the call centre team that we complained to said they were unable to access the call details to verify this fraudulent activity because they were not actually part of virgin media both the call centre we spoke to and the fraudulent retention team who illegally signed us up for a new contract are two separate companies that vm outsource to and we would therefore have to raise a complain online via the virgin media website in order for it to be investigated further by the real virgin am quite honestly shocked by just how terrible this company is and will be taking this to ofcom as this situation breaches so many consumer duties it is hard to list them all,Bad
2100,worst internet company ever but dont read my review just bear in mind that its the company with more complaints filed and it must be for a reason,Bad
2101,thanks for taking the time to leave a review it is very disappointing to hear about the issues that youve had with your tv installation i can assure you that this isnt the standard of service that we aim to technician should arrive with the appointment timeframe booked for you you can manage your appointment via your online account or through your my virgin media app under orders and appointments,Bad
2102,if you have ever fancied switching to vodafone broadband i would strongly recommend that you think again i was lured into switching to vodafone after seeing a amazon reward voucher offer my first switch date was deferred by an extra day for an unknown reason and then when the revised switch date arrived my previous providers service stopped as expected and then nothing happened the following day i contacted vodafone who couldnt explain why my broadband hadnt activated i then spent countless hours over the next week talking to countless call centre advisers who all attempted to resolve the issue in the end i was advised that the only solution would be to end the account and restart the whole process with a new account except that it would now be charged a slightly higher monthly amount and i would have to kiss goodbye to my voucher as vodafone refused to honour it it also meant three more weeks with no broadband whilst i waited for a new activation date i was advised i would be credited with compensation but that has never been paid to me a month after the revised activation date ive realised that i have been charged three monthly amounts for my first failed account this is in addition to monthly amounts for my second successful account i had to resolve this via online chatbot because the telephone number i originally had for vodafone appeared to be discontinued and this took three hours because the chatbot kept disconnecting following lengthy conversations in the end i ended up chatting to several advisers explaining the same problems over and over again in the end vodafone accepted that theyd made a mistake in not actually cancelling the first failed account and that a refund would be heading to my bank account but i had to speak to yet another adviser to get the failed account cancelled properly to ensure that i wouldnt be charged again and to ensure that i wouldnt be charged a cancellation fee for mistake this has been an example of how a company can fail miserably to operate a switching process and their inability to resolve issues efficiently all those hours spent on the phone or on the chatbot have been draining i am paying more than i initially expected to pay lost out on the voucher and not received the promised compensation i also wrote to the ceo in december and never received a reply i will leave vodafone when my contract expires and i will never sign up for a vodafone product again,Bad
2103,my broadband speeds have been a consistent mbps for over a year when a new neighbour moved in a few days ago they had out to connect their phone and internet service after the engineers left i checked my speeds and noticed that my speeds had dropped from mbps to mbps although some readings were even lower sometimes as low as mbps i contacted bt by phone and was told that they were not concerned as the speeds were above their minimum speeds i have received speeds of mbps for over a year yet the bt employee i spoke with said he was not concerned and although i made it clear that this was a complaint he insisted that it did not warrent calling out to check the pole outside my home as in his opinion i was getting sufficient speed he disregarded my point that my speeds were mbps for over a year and had dropped by over mbps as he felt that was more than sufficient bt are the lowest of the low and will always give you the lowest speed they can get away with rip off merchants,Bad

2108,after weeks of phone calls and text messages trying to get virgin media to transfer my mums landline from her previous provider today i have received the following message hello it s virgin media here unfortunately we are unable to port your home telephone number as you have disconnected it from your current provider and we are only able to port active telephone numbers we have provided you with a virgin media did not disconnect the number and now my year old mum who relies on her land line has lost the number that she has had for the past years virgin media is an absolute disgraceful excuse for a company,Bad

2119,i have been trying to settle my complaint with bt since november last they are trying to charge me for contract cancellation when three was no contract they eventually agreed this by e i am still getting final demands for payment i rang them again today and after mins on the said they would sort it a costly and miserable experience i would never use bt again and i advise others to think carefully before dealing with them there are more reliable and honest providers out there,Bad
2120,i was a longterm customer with vm and recently switched over to bt i had agreed on a date to close my account with vm with at least vm personnel vm subsequently sent me a bill charging for services after this date as they stated the account was closed on a later date on phoning vm to explain the situation the vm personnel tried to waiver this charge but couldnt since i was no longer an existing customer and advised i email their customer service which i did two weeks later i had a reply from vm restating that as they provided services to the later date the charge was valid and the money has been taken from my account they therefore considered the situation to be resolved this shows a complete lack of regard for customers and a flawed customer service procedure ignoring the issue the customer is raising and taking their money before further dialogue as someone who has to carefully budget constantly buying this from shops hardly ever buying new clothes for myself and my children looking for supermarket offers during weekly grocery shopping i resent a big corporate company like vm taking my hard earned money in this manner,Bad
2121,this is the worst internet provider out there i struggled to load this site to state how bad its service is i live in a student house and with the pandemic all of our lessons are online so good internet is we barely can load into our lectures weve complained many times and all they did was run a network test and then say there was nothing wrong we pay for the highest package they provide so we cant even upgrade,Bad
2122,i dont normally do reviews but this is more a warning to anyone thinking of getting involved with this networked and had i checked first i would have calmly walked away so when i put my sim card in i had no data only calls and texts it took me attempts to talk to someone after being on hold for an average time of mins the barrier was horrific i got hung up on times for asking a question then they started laughing at me and talking in their own l and hung up once more on my own back i managed to get the settings online and set up however the net is very slow and i dont get or g also keep getting cut off mid way on calls truly appalling network and if ofcom did their job properly they would be stripped of ther licence and find heavily avoid at all costs,Bad

2124,i had purchased a mobile phone with ee back in where my mum at the time had to take the contract out on my behalf due to my age which i thought was odd the phone itself was fine however i still to this day nearly years on have tried to change the name of the contract over to myself and have yet been unsuccessful in doing so due to so many reasons given by the ee advisers in local shops and over the customer services helpline this result has stopped me from being able to access my own account without my mum being present furthermore and worst of all i also took out an additional sim only plan for work purposes again very good and competitive rates in comparison to other phone providers however i was advised by the ee call adviser over the phone that this particular phone direct debit would be set up in conjunction with my existing ee direct debit that i took out in i took the phone bill out and months later a letter came through the post from ee notifying me that they had tried several times to contact me and was informing me of missing payments to the additional phone i had set up firstly i had no contact whatsoever from ee other than the letter secondly after immediately getting in contact with ee i was informed that the direct debit had not been set up and that this has since effected my credit rating the lack of like responses and the lack of respect given to their customers has really made my personal experience with ee disheartening upsetting and scary to think that ee are regulated by the financial conduct authority and treating customers fairly act this has forced me to take legal action against ee and has actually stopped me taking out a mortgage on the purchase of my first home this is actually my first bad review i have ever published and i would honestly advise anyone who is looking to take out their business with ee to not peruse it with them and to save their credit rating being ruined i have worked with many companies in my time and this has to be the worst business that lacks in their customer needs and satisfaction total disrespect given from ee,Bad
2125,right silly company if you complaint about something its like taking to wind its my story why i think that in october from to we have been in turkey on holiday in day october at just gave ring to my mum for a second she didnt pick up that conversation but i has been charged nearly pounds took my all money of when we get back to uk ive try to sorted it in o really just waste of time customer service said somebody make any call in this time october at for over min but not from turkey from different country do not listen what you taking just think you are idiot try to explain time in log call is in this day and just ive robbed of my account for something what i didnt made costumer service said they cant do refund because in system somebody did call for over min but i didnt make any call just taking to conversation the guy in shop he just promised to do top up for pounds because he cant do more but we have to wait couple of hours time of waiting is till today for top up and still nothing i feel really robbed of money,Bad
2126,what an utter shambles days with no service since we stupidly tried to move to vodafone hours talking to them so far not one person can do anything more than read off a screen that our internet is not possesses people like this to imagine that they should make a living interacting with the could not be any worse,Bad
2127,regrettably after over years of combined loyalty to talktalk split between myself and my partners accounts talktalk have decided not to honour a refund for a period of months where not a single call or megabyte of data was used my partner and i both remember her cancelling the contract in december but they have continued to take payment via the direct debit which is a sum in excess of they claim despite our separate memories that they have no record of her cancelling the contract it feels like talktalk are usmy partner and i moved in together in december i transferred my account to the new address and she cancelled hers as previously stated we had been with talktalk for over years between us in that time weve paid them almost apparently to talktalk loyalty counts for minutes on the phone to a wholly unsympathetic employee it is wholeheartedly clear that talktalk have absolutely no decency whatsoever but what i cant understand is the short sighted nature of it weve given them between us and despite slow speeds and intermittent outages we probably would have stuck with them simply out of ease they could have had far more money going forward from us but now i will be cancelling the contract when it expires and wouldnt go near them with a barge pole again all over ive had dealings with a few awful companies in my time but never before has a company ive shown so much loyalty to let me down so badly at a time when were currently furloughed due to corona virus and other companies are going above and beyond to help their has stood out as a beacon of all that is terrible and soulless in business we received zero compassion loyalty or understanding from talktalk its impossible to speak to anybody who can make a sensible decision and as such they have lost our custom i can only hope anyone reading this avoids talktalk at all costs whether its poor infrastructure poor connection or god awful customer service stay with talktalk long enough and they will let you down we feel like talktalk has taken our money given no consideration to the circumstances and disregarded our goodwill and customer loyalty which clearly counts for nothing i have asked them to terminate the contract i currently hold with them once it completes and they claim they are unable to do this they are unable to mark a contract for termination at its completion to me this seems bazaar another example of the utter lack of sense talktalk makes in its protocol and decision making and another example of how they greedily try and hold on to your money at whatever cost,Bad
2128,customer service is appalling who thinks its ok to leave two pensioners without any services except mobile phone for weeks this was what you expected us to do at engineers were good your channels are good with a wide we would find it hard to recommend you to anyone,Bad
2129,a rep called me from talk talk after she went thro her i said i would think about it she put the phone down on me i am already a customer she was just trying to get me to change the package i am on so few days later they sent me an email asking me to say how i had got on with their reps call i told them but have had no response they obviously do not care for their customers i beleive an apology would have been a good idea,Bad

2150,i have been with talktalk since they began as carphone and had endless problems over many years most of you will already have discovered that non of the isps are without similar problems we have tried to continue with talktalk as its really so much trouble to change isps and also the potential loss of email addresses however now they threaten thati have been receiving threats from talktalk by email your mailbox is not attached to a broadband contract and you havent yet signed up to talktalk mail plus we wanted to remind you that your talktalk mail service will be changed after unfortunately if you choose not to sign up for talktalk mail plus from youll lose the vast majority of talktalk mail features for example youll only be able to sign in at talktalk mail to check your emails talktalk mail is still free for our broadband customers talktalk customers can have up to five mailboxes with us for free but in order to keep running and improving the service we need to start charging customers who no longer have broadband with you have talktalk broadband and want to keep enjoying all the benefits of talktalk mail for free link your email address to your broadband account by clicking the link is instantly blocked by talktalk when i click it i have emailed the sender and the mail has gone through but i was ignored after research online i tried to add my email address to my account but the system keeps saying something went wrong and i have tried for some spending over an hour with talktalk on live chat i was off as usual and told to keep trying as there are problems with the system so having the threat of loss of my email address after all these years seriously effects my business family and say they will charge me for use of my existing email address of over years via an external client thunderbird for example and block access to my account from the mentioned date its extremely unfair that they will not let me register the address on my talktalk account this is typical of the kind of service they could write pages about the problems we have had with talktalk however i would advise you ask friends to find an alternative this is an extremely bad company and telephone contact is via india its often impossible for me to understand what the person is saying especially when the connection is poor and i can hardly hear what they are saying despite a strong accent,Bad

2217,i am absolutely lost for words at the poor service provision i experienced today over a very simple and easy too resolve issue how hard is it too get a replacement router with impossible without paying of course my previous communication was poor but today they have exceeded themselves talktalk as an isp overall is relatively good and i have had few problems over the years but woe you have a problem and have to contact them their standard of customer wipes out their overall rating as an isp and for that reason alone i would struggle to recommend them to anyone would give zero rate if i could based on todays experience,Bad

2220,just following up from your response to david mayer below having looked at your encouragement to reach out via facebook and twitter all that your facebook messenger service provides is links to articles that are of no help and just generic it appears you dont really want to speak to anyone and are just posting these responses to make your social media accounts appear in a positive perspective to the wider audience i suggest you check your admin accounts and contact the people youve promised youll call back,Bad
2221,talk talk have good offers to entice you in and make you happy to start with however you are then likely to run into issues with your router or service to which you are told it will be a week wait for someone to come out to have a look their livechat is awful and they just cut you off whereas the managers on the phone just have attitude and come across as rude and interrupt you a have hidden fees that they do not tell you about and then dump them on you they do not try to keep you when you go elsewhere not that wed stay with the horrific experiences we have endured go elsewhere,Bad
2222,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad

2232,wanted to set up a basic payg phone for an elderly relative as its a simple device everything has to be done via texts or phone call no app or online facilities however attempting to register a payment card and top up turned out to be incredibly frustrating and ultimately im dealing with an automated service i expect a calm businesslike voice to explain the options here you get what sounds like an shouty teenaged girl after finally inputting the card details it said i was being transferred to a representative but instead sent me back to the same menu id started with trying a second time it again said i was being transferred whereupon the call disconnected that was your last chance we switched him to a sim only contract with another provider,Bad
2233,the internet is good at the mg speed but everything is totally destroyed by a beyond belief poor customer service i do not have words to describe the total incompetence of this company and if the staff were paid a bonus to irritate customers they could not do better how can you agree a new contract only to be told they cannot do on three occasions the staff even deny the details in emails that the company send you if you sign with these you will regret it at the end of the contract do not do they will even try to blackmail you with the cut off of your email service i have a new hobby telling people how bad this company is as i have already lost two days of my life trying to deal with them and still not resolved without pleasure so i might as well try to reclaim with some pleasure,Bad
2234,my internet should be at the highest speed but it says weak security im not happy with this service reception is poor in the house and my phone automatically defaults to bt pay for wifi which is totally unacceptable,Bad
2235,its a shame i cant give no have a ridiculous pricing policy dont complain when the price goes up and they will double your bill if you can get the services at a reasonable price then they probably wont work the last straw was paying for a pay per view that didnt work they knew it didnt work i was billed anyway i complained and weeks later i was still charged for it saying i would get a refund on my next bill as the bill had already been processed refused to give an immediate refund and said i would have to contact my bank to get the money back utterly useless,Bad
2236,the useless and slowest app in history if there was a guinness world record for this then my ee app would win it hands down no problem im pretty sure dial up was quicker and before some clown from ee says to delete the app and reinstall it why should we have to do that oh yeah because your app is crap,Bad
2237,had the best deal but they ended up cancelling the broadband just as it was due to be delivered sat on the phone to them for over an hour for them to tell me theres nothing they can do and will have to reorder and wait another two weeks wouldnt bother with them they have the worst customer service,Bad
2238,virgin have become impossible to get hold of they have made it really difficult for customers to get in touch either by phone or online have to google their phone number because its nowhere on their own site having tried to get through to them several times in the last few months ive come to the conclusion they dont want to hear from customers they want your money and thats it ive had lots of broadband issues and the online guides are absolutely st calling their tech support number gets you an automated service that goes through the same advice as online and then hangs up on you when i did finally get through to a human they were marginally more helpful and got me up and running but it took ages and i had to wait mins after the call before i would know if it worked so had to take it on faith this person knew what they were doing not a great ask when your service has been so poor beforehand today ive been trying to find out some information about their new hub and even that is impossible their contact us page is down and only gives error but here is a guide to upgrade oh whats that they want you to spend more instead of getting the help you want absolute joke shame as virgin used to be fairly decent these days their only selling point is their broadband speed as soon as i can get these speeds from a different company believe me i will and for any potential customers reading if you only need the usual mbs that other providers offer then i would strongly suggest going with one of them,Bad

2244,new customers get the best deals with existing customers being ripped off year after year a month loyalty bonus is a joke when you consider that a new customer would receive the same full house package for a month less than an existing one make sure you switch to another provider after a year especially with the great deals on offer from cash back websites companies such as virgin media make money through misplaced consumer loyalty complacency,Bad

2248,i changed my direct debit details and was assured by talktalk on two separate contacts that my bill payment would be taken from my new debit it was not taken from either bank and talktalk applied a late payment fee after some debate they agreed to waive the fee but it would appear on my yet to be generated next bill i would have to watch out for the bill and have to contact talktalk yet again to get them to remove the fee i suspect i will have to pay it and it will appear as a credit on my next bill talktalk accounting systems are really not fit for purpose a debit can be applied in an instant but it takes about months to get a credit,Bad
2249,they couldnt even deliver the min download speed into the house that was promised in my contract i have had ongoing issues with talk talk from the first month after i signed with them after complaining i was told they would send out a bt open reach engineer who would try and fix the problem and if it wasnt successful and it exceeded another days of problems we could walk away from the contract and have a full refund for the money we have spent the engineer arrived and openly admitted my speed into the house was terrible after his visited he did manage to increase the speed slightly but said please keep an eye on it we were still having problems i checked the speed again and it had dropped back down to what we had been receiving initially i rang talk talk back and explained the situation again i mentioned i had been told if no improvements had been made we could leave the contract and have a full refund because talk talk would be in breach of contract due to them not providing the min download speed into the house i was passed through to three yes different people placed on hold twice and was on the phone in excess of hour minutes to be told talk talk would not let me leave and i wouldnt have a refund because i didnt ring them back after the days had passed this is absolutley ridiculous and a ploy to cheat customers out of their god given right to leave if the contract is breached by the provider i work in retail and sometimes work away this is why i couldnt ring them any sooner and my partner works from home as an online consultant and needs good internet access to complete her daily work load can you believe we have to turn off our wifi and connect to our mobile phones g connection because its actually better than what we are getting from talk talk i would never recommend talk talk after this experience i feel i have been let down massively im sure if i stopped paying my direct debit they would have something to say but i have continued paying every month for something im not happy with and not recieving i may aswell flush per month down the toilet i would also like to know why i havent had a call back from talk talk when they rang me a few days ago and i explained i was at work but was free from pm to take the call conveniently for talk talk i never received a call back if you have any decency and respect for me now is the time to review this case and actually do the right thing cancel our contract and reimburse us for all the months we have paid and have not received what was promised im asking for nothing more other than what ive spent i can not be fairer than that i will be contacting trading standards and citizens advise to find out what legal rights i have if we can not sort this in a fair and timely manor m the reply below i have already tried to contact the chat support team via the twitter message i received back from talktalk yes i also complained on twitter too and guess what your chat service team is currently unavailable i would like a call please i shouldnt have to be doing the running around,Bad

2279,awful awful awful service we had broadband and the quality was absolutely horrendous from day complained for months and was then told to move the router ft from my tv this would have put it in my front garden a point which the person on the phone couldnt grasp this went on for months and i was eventually told that because my complaint had gone unresolved for months i could leave my contract with no charge we did this then started getting monthly bills contacted talktalk and they said they would rectify the situation we then started getting letters from a debt recovery company thanks talktalk thats all they do talktalk no never ever again,Bad
2280,talking for minutes then she put me on hold and disconnected my call very nice of you,Bad
2281,this provider always seems good at the beginning and then for some mysterious reason becomes extremely unreliable same as years ago when i left them then tried again thinking they must have improved nope,Bad
2282,ive been with ee for years ive never been with anyone else and they refuse to help loyal customers there webchat service is the worst ive used with representatives that never understand what you say,Bad

2285,when the service is working it is great getting speeds of over mb however when it doesnt their customer service is atrocious you can spend hours trying to get through on the phone there is no online chat its difficult to cancel service change service etc recently i have needed to get two wifi boosters but the service has been so poor the boosters dont boost and speeds deteriorate constantly they have a great app to check for around the house nice and slick to use but useless when you have issues,Bad
2286,the ordering process was really easy and the product turned up quickly but once they have your money thats where the service ends unfortunately one of my items is faulty and trying to make contact is near impossible some might say deliberately difficult there is no phone number to call to try and return the product so stuck in a cycle of unhelpful email responses im now over worse off and my internet is as bad as it has ever been certainly not following the bob hoskins line it is good to talk for those that remember it would recommend going to somewhere else in case you are unlucky enough to have a fault on your several days later and communication is still poor using only email which is extremely difficult and difficult drawn out process to return still no replacement or refund the whole set up is an absolute shambles after waiting months to get my internet connected im wondering if any part of bt functions properly,Bad
2287,absolutely a waste of can spend ages waiting far a you finally type to somebody then then want to transfer you wait all over again not worth the effort better to forgot to mention this review is about live chat on talk talk services,Bad
2288,i had a bad experience we agree on a package but never give me what i want,Bad
2289,in my view worst service i have ever received cancelled my home move and a renewed account twice and then expect me to go through two credit checks because of their mess south african call centre beyond useless with people who cant even spell waiting after weeks of not having broadband to have a ceo management complaints member to ring me now cant get broadband through another provider due to credit checks put through by these fools wait for over an hour with no resolution have made over fifty calls since january with still no help,Bad
2290,i will never ever use vodafone again their operators are insolent their customer service is non existent and if you are lucky to actually speak to someone who does not like what you are cut you off or put you through to south africa,Bad
2291,the broadband itself is reliable and i get great speeds but thats about it the hub didnt work at all and had to be replaced the second one didnt work either we had no internet for days after our activation date i ended up purchasing a desperate modem as the by hub wouldnt give signal more the a metre away was promised money off my bill for the internet not working but that never happened was meant to receive credit as a new customer but that didnt happen i was meant to get a free lg tv as part of my bundle but that never showed customer service is shoddy the only was to speak to someone is to call the second they open at am ive spent hours waiting on hold on many occasions before giving up when you do get through its a robot from abroad that cant understand anything that isnt on their script all in all i wish i stayed with sky and got their lower speeds then be with virgin media,Bad
2292,upgraded to iphone and it doesnt upgrade as software is not up to date told me to go to apple store and have updated new phone so cant be done any others way no apple store in my town sent back as product not as described,Bad
2293,had a year sim only contract terrible signal awful online profile difficult to navigate and useless for simple tasks like trying to cancel my sim was emailed at the end of my contract to say it was ending swapped to a new company sim only to find i was still being billed by vodafone couldnt log on to my account online because you can only get on with a text to your phone number which i was no longer using and when i finally did get on i couldnt cancel the anywhere tried the online chat only to tell the same simple story and give the same information to different people i only wanted to cancel the contract and was then told that hidden in the terms and conditions is the fact that you will keep on paying after your contract ends unless you specifically cancel it so bloody cheap and underhanded considering you cant cancel easily im normally pretty easygoing about these things but i was given no indication that payments would continue in the end of year email and there was nowhere online to check this so without going back through the entire terms and conditions section which i didnt know to do it was impossible to find out so angry i will never give vodafone another penny of my money,Bad
2294,called to cancel my contract as moving out of my property and my new property not being ready agent on the th who agreed to cancel with no fees has not actioned the cancellation this means my internet is still on when a new homeowner is now in my old property cannot cancel for another days or so meaning they were planning on charging me for something i have not used and should have been cancelled offered credit to cover the charges but they do not no how much charges will be added lets hope its enough to cover my final never recommend as if never checked could of caused me missed payments and all kinds issues,Bad
2295,i have been with virgin media broadband for nearly years but their customer service over the last two years has been appalling their call centres give you a different excuse for poor broadband service every time you call them the story for poor service changes daily,Bad
2296,customer service in all parts is they do know what to do company,Bad
2297,for some reason despite reading all of the negative reviews about incompetence i naively thought that i might be the lucky one and that i wouldnt suffer any issues having transferred a week ago they still havent managed to transfer my phone number across and every time you phone up they tell you it will be sorted within the next working day and that the customer services person will call you back to confirm the issue is resolved needless to say they never fix it and never call you back in addition to this vodafone have now somehow cancelled my number so im unable to receive any calls or texts i can no longer access my account online and the mobile app doesnt work it really seems like they can get nothing right,Bad
2298,goodluck getting your number transferred avoid this company at all costs tragic customer service making you jump through hoops,Bad
2299,so fess up where are you hiding the live chat because despite it being referenced in multiple places on your site i havent been able to locate it at all i want to know why my renewal offer is more than the same package on your homepage absolutely disgusting,Bad
2300,we had virgin media for tv broadband and phone for or years at our previous address i had become pretty disillusioned by the broadband we were receiving for some time very slow and frequent cut outs i was told that there was a nondescript problem in our area and they were forced to refund our broadband bill over several months which had to be chased to get back and that they couldnt say when the problem in the area would be resolved on that basis we decided that as we were moving house virgin would not be coming with us cue the hard sell from their sales people and believe it or not we were given an offer we couldnt refuse thinking that the would be better in our new area we had to wait two weeks for the installation in itself fine having been given a pm time slot the engineer arrived at only to tell us that we hadnt ordered any broadband only tv and phone our emails obviously said differently but not only could they not install it then they in fact didnt have capacity in the area at all for us having refused the offer to go on a waiting list we were left there with nothing wondering what the just happened no real apology from virgin just told that someone hadnt done their checks properly weeks ago when we ordered to be fair the engineer was very nice and courteous not his fault but i would give virgin media a wide berth,Bad
2301,so basically phone contract was meant to end on the th march i upgraded this phone through the app and received my upgrade phone phone after a few weeks i noticed i was being billed double so i asked why and they said that phone and had been put on the same account on the app i think they rolled my contract on for phone for some reason but they should not be able to do that without your consent or spoke to a lady and she told me that i would have to cancel and return phone but that she would send me an upgrade phone phone in place of phone which didnt make any sense to me all i could think of is maybe its to try get rid of my number and contract with phone but why question their expertise and on top of that she tried selling me broadband when i had just complained about being charged more than once she must have known i was proceeded to then tell me it was out of her hands and id have to speak to the returns team when i got through to them they told me it would be as i am out of my cooling off period which is disgusting as did not know they had rolled my contract on phone on bearing in mind im only pretty young i can not afford this money not upfront as i was upset i got someone else to speak on my behalf and the lady called sharon told me that it was wrong of them to send me another phone out she had to cancel it through dpd and told me if i got a parcel i was to refuse it she mentioned briefly about changing my old number to a payg account or transferring my old number to my new phone or selling my phone which i dont think it should come tuesday st dpd parcel arrived with phone which i refused sharon told me she would ring me back but still waiting on a call checked back on my phone account and they are now trying to charge me and gave me gb without my consent on my halifax account it says i have x estimated payments of to go out so i had to cancel my direct debit as im not taking any chances until this is sorted i cant afford to go over drawn i only work part time i dont even use phone anymore that was the whole point of me upgrading and the fact they are still charging me for it is disgusting when when said they are supposed to be switching it to a payg account or cancelling it the ideal solution please sort it out vodafone or you will be loosing a loyal customer and i will end up with a bad credit score i might even be forced to take it further if we can not come to a it will get sorted but its really disgusting that they play with peoples naivety they make you feel so stupid too hoping i will be able to get a refund for all the money they have robbed me i will be going with a different company when this phone runs out just sick of getting sent from person to person and told different things shocking customer me unnecessary stress and on my part i should have contacted them earlier but i have been busy with other they have some for an honest if you are young just starting out in life with bills or suffer with mental health issues or anxiety please avoid update on my experience if it gets sorted and if not i will be going through or ombudsman,Bad

2310,could not get a resolution to my issue which was not to be able to dial out from my landline number but at the same time the internet connection was ok and inability to dial out meant i had a continuous engaged tone which was not possibly to break therefore no chance of dialing out from my landline all the time i have had the issue here the internet has been ok,Bad
2311,seems to be almost impossible to cancel your contract with them they never action it ive been trying since august and they still keep trying to bill me for a service i dont use or want they put the phone down on you and have no record of anything,Bad
2312,appalling customer services discrimination against age and people who are technically challenged coverage isnt what they claim avoid this company at all costs its a rip off,Bad
2313,i have been through a very stressful time with virgin for the last weeks or more absolutely horrendous customer service never in my life have i dealt with a company as careless originally i called to terminate my contract as virgin increased the price which i cannot afford the agent tried to sell me the new package and he confirmed that i had until the june to cancel the contract for free i reconfirmed with him that it is june he said yes i tried to call virgin multiple of time but not able to reach to them as the waiting time is always more than an hour i finally managed to get hold of virgin at around pm on the june and explained that i wanted to cancel my contract one of the agent was very rude and keep saying that i was already over the days cooling period i said i understand that it is the standard term however the other agent confirmed to me that i have until the june to cancel she keeps saying she cannot do anything now i keep asking to speak to the manager and then she said the reason our wifi is not stable is because of the area she suggested us to upgrade to mbps for the household of for the wifi to be stable which is ridiculous i keep calling few times every day after to try to cancel my account but the waiting time is always mins or over and i get hang up on me multiple of time every single time i call them i have to talk to different agent and explain my story again over and over again i probably tried to call them more than times over the last weeks weeks ago i managed to talk to of the manager he reassured that he will listen to the phone call between me and the agent and then get back to me within days days over no one called me i need to called them again and guess what the agent said they do not really listen to phone call and he does not know who is the manager i was talking about everytime i talked to virgin i get different and opposite advise from the agents like serious you are the big company and this is how you treat your customer virgin wants to charge me for early termination fee the first agent said they will charge me i confirmed that there is a cap of for early termination fee and then the manager said yes i am right and try to charge me that amount even the manager of virgin does not know their policy which is available for public online your directors need to seriously shake the company up and do something you are a disgrace how youre even operating is beyond me problems not solved wont be solved and never will be because all you want is your disconnection fee you should be paying me a fee for your horrible service thats forever going down lying on multiple calls which i have recorded managers not even knowing there is a government cap on disconnection fees and trying to get despite the cap being you are trash,Bad
2314,i wish i could give it below i bought an additional sim to my existing account which i have for a good few years the sim never arrived i called vodafone asking what was going on and they asked me to wait another few days or sowell it never arrived and they charged me the month i called again and told them to cancel both the charges and the sim contract as they never supplied the sim and they literally told me i had to pay to cancel the contract i said really how if i just stop paying the whole account then they were not bothered they want to charge to cancel the sim that never arrived ok vodafone asta la vista what a joke im not going to be your costumer ever again i am escalating to the regulator as you vodafone will not charge me for something i never received and told me to wait for it thanks but no,Bad
2315,i consider that o totally fails in its duty of received the first and only bill from by email on since i supposedly took a contract on i emailed o three times to point out their error there was no response i was later informed by mr hutchinson that as i had taken out a verbal contract but they were unable to provide me with any documents to substantiate his claim there was no contract in the meantime santander had allowed o to set up a direct debit on my bank account on without my knowledge so were able to take money from my santander bank spent countless hours of my time contacting the os but the agents were unable to help apart from one who tried but couldnt access my account which is not surprising because id never had one customer support and didnt exist unfortunately we didnt notice it until when we received a refund of from telefonica whose name we didnt recognise we then discovered that this had been going on for months i reported it to the ombudsman but he always acted in favour of o after months in all i gave up and accepted a refund and a good will i could give o a rating of less than a star i would,Bad
2316,very nasty and terrible mobile phone and broadband company as per my experience with them many years do not deal with them they are thirsty for money they increase the bill and take it their own as a customer i strongly recommend that dont use ee they service is very vey bad as well i got bad experience with them about the billing,Bad

2318,im desperately trying to sort out a issue with virgin media i have a complaint raised but when i try to talk to virgin about this they cant seem to get me to the right person to help and i end up on the phone for hours repeating my story to someone who clearly isnt going to help me virgin appear to have no intention of dealing with complaints about their services and their behaviour when you try and legitimately complain off to the ombudsman for me,Bad
2319,shocking tried charging me bill for months because they changed my package by accident and took weeks to rectify it,Bad

2324,my experiences are similar to all those i speak to you get fed up with the price you pay so negotiate a reduction in your bill by reducing your pack and sacrificing some of the few tv stations worth watching then find the cost gradually increasing back to its former level and you are supposed to be appeased by yet more youll not watch because they are all aimed at youth with low attention span and full of commercial do costs keep going up once your package is in place where are the escalating costs involved why arent we allowed to cherry pick our programs to suit us as individuals this question has never been satisfactorily answered by the telesales staff who have always been civil am i subsidising those who sit watching telly all week,Bad
2325,the mobile is the worst company in the company runs by buy ultra bundle i receive the sim they didnt send me the digit bundle activation call their customer support team and they send me the wrong activation charge pence per calli call them again and again but they didnt help me at customer support team are the biggest you can expect from a rubbish company called company runs by company with rubbish recommend this pile of junk company to anyone,Bad

2327,it is impossible to explain all the confusion distress loss of money and loss of trust this company has put me through so here just one single piece of advice from a very experienced customer do not sign up to any service with this company whether mobile or broadband or anything they offer even once your contract expires you will find it impossible to get away from them even if they cannot meet your requirements anymore their contract texts are unreasonable their cancellation procedures confuse even themselves and their customer service clerks are incompetent including the specialist team set up to deal with the huge and increasing number of ombudsman complaints this company is full of clowns or worse liars,Bad
2328,the whole day no signal at all we are in ffs they could at least update any of the social media that they have this is ridiculous,Bad
2329,just hopeless should be on a minimum of mbps always a lot slower unless you have just been in discussion with talk talk support must conclude that the service is throttled down,Bad
2330,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad

2337,i got an offer via the vodafone mobile app offering me gb of data unlimited uk calls and text at pounds a month when i process to check out the app requested me to contact customer service and i spoke to the advisor they offered me the same after purchasing when i check the app it says gb for pounds i contacted customer service to resolve this at pm and they transferred me between the department and put me in a queue from pm to and still unattended i regret my decision to op vodafone at least they need to value the customers time and the word they are giving,Bad
2338,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
2339,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
2340,i was asked to give a review based on a call i made ive tried texting them back but the text wont send so ill make the review here how would you rate from to the call you just honestly i feel disgusted i rang three times to ask a simple question every time i rang there was a noise on the line and i could barely hear the technician the first one seemed upset that i was constantly asking him to repeat and then the line went bad the second one didnt even bother to answer the phone he put the phone down on me the third tried to understand but a beep kept going off during the conversation i have interacted with ee in the past and this just seems to get worse i would score if possible now i will have to go to the shop tomorrow to solve this issue because a service that is to provide help is in desperate need of help and has none to provide thanks for nothing,Bad
2341,brought a vodafone smart ultra for my son he had it less than a month and was caught in a rain storm although the phone was in his pocket which was supposedly waterproof a few days later the touch screen stopped working took it back to vodafone assuming there was a fault but when it went back to their service team i was told that water had got into the phone and hence the screen wasnt working and this invalidated the warranty to me this shows a weakness in the phone and how easy it is to water damage it i have had many other phones which have been out in all kinds of weather and never has the phone been damaged by water i assume the phone is just not sealed properly or water can easily get into one of the ports never the less got the usual vodafone shocking service and they refused to even sell me another phone at a reduced price just did not want to know so foolish me i ordered a moto g phone from them on the web they had a really good price on them took delivery of the phone at their local store but when i got home and try to set the phone up it wouldnt recognise the sim card after trying another sim card it still wouldnt work so took it back to their store the same day after testing with one of their sim cards they acknowledged the phone was faulty but they didnt have any other phones in the store to swap it said if i them a couple of days they would get stock and they would phone me having not heard from them i went into the store still no stock so i asked them to take the phone back and give me a refund they wouldnt do this as i had ordered the phone of the web so would have to return it via the web i thought i was dealing with the same company but apparently the different divisions do not communicate with each other so went back home and after several hours on the web and phone dont ask they have finally agreed to send me an envelope so i can return the phone and get a refund this is quite the worst company i have ever dealt with total lack of customer service and seem to enjoy passing you from pillar to post from now on regardless of cost i will never buy another thing from them by the way i have been a vodafone customer for at least years but that doesnt seem to matter either just an update no envelope received surprise surprise so phoned vodafone again and spend the usual hours on the phone they then acknowledged that no envelope had be sent have agreed to send another envelope i wont hold my breath and also send a courier to pick up the phone although they cannot tell me when this mystical courier is going to come they also tried to check that i had ordered the phone less than days ago i think that if i had ordered the phone more than days ago they would have refused to accept it back i really cant believe a company can be so bad by the way i ordered the same phone from gaff and although i paid more it arrived the next day and worked just shows the cheapest is not always the best,Bad
2342,has become very expensive for the overall package im paying per month friends are with sky and virgin for similar packages and are paying way way less than me also we have poor internet connection have two people working from home at moment in household and often have poor connection issues affecting ability to work from home effectively,Bad

2346,quality of the service not as guaranteed my broadband connection totally down for last days i have contacted them customer service around times in the last days every time i contacting them different people answering my inquiries and keep doing the same test again and again and wasting my time i was keep asking to send an engineer to fix this issue and they keep delaying it today i have been promised that engineer will connect me between pm to pm i can cancelled my works and waiting at home for engineer and nobody came and no updates from talktalk about it very disappointed please avoid this people and give them a lesson about how important is a customer satisfaction,Bad
2347,awful internet quality awful customer service literally the worst company ive ever dealt with gutted ive taken out a year contract with them because they were cheap would much rather pay more to get a better service will know for next time never going back to talk talk ever again,Bad
2348,absolute rubbish no internet so called up and forgot the password they refused to do anything other than send out a new password months later and passwords supposedly sent but nothing received i finally spoke to someone with a brain who changed the password for me they then sent a new router went to collect and it was sent to a collection point addresses to someone else in total i called approximately times over a month period i lost count how many times i explained the situation and after being on hold was hung up on because they did not know how to deal with the issue before i found someone to change the password i could not even cancel because i didnt pass security if i stopped paying the bill for a service i was not getting they would ruin my credit in minutes flat so months after the problem started i finally tell them to stuff it and cancel my contract i called them so many time today i got my phone bill with of extra call charges from calling these muppets,Bad
2349,absolutely a firm of money grabbers tried to cancel my contract as never had broadband upstairs happy to take money but not sort problems out all i get is try moving router and buy wifi extender tried it all to no they want to cancel my contract lol got the phone put down on me twice and would not put me onto a manager ripped all there gear out got bt in and got full broadband upstairs and even in garden would not recommend virgin to anybody,Bad
2350,my connection date came and went with no router equipment recieved and my old supplier ending my connection so no internet to run my business from messages and cases opened but no response,Bad
2351,dreadful service we had no wifi for at least days and no one knew what was going on look this isnt life and death but its the basic service a company like this should provide this is a company that spends millions on adverts that tell everyone how amazing they are,Bad
2352,have been waiting months for virgin media to install my broadband every weeks they inform me that they are coming to connect and minutes later they inform me they have to cancel i have never dealt with a company that are so incompetent and when i phone them after waiting about an hour they cut you off totally ignorant still look on the good side per day plus every no show they just dont give a toss,Bad
2353,the reason i give star is because virgin internet is terrible and every single day my internet cuts out around times and every time if not more whenever my childs school has to shut due to my daughter cant even get her work done properly as the internet stops so many times i try to get through im on hold for ages of they just fix it and it happens again after a day i pay nearly a month and is doesnt work properly so its not value for money,Bad
2354,they have never rectified low broadband speed i pay for m and receive even at times i know they are beholden to bt but im sure that they receive a lower quality of internet than their own bt customers no permanent resolution after years of low speeds,Bad
2355,as always my talktalk tt customer experience has been really bad all at tt should be disgusted with what they provide in terms of service a word like criminal springs to uses up too much of my life i hate tt tt stresses me out big time,Bad
2356,ive had a few bad experiences with virgin media generally their customer service is abysmal with long call waits and uninformed first was when i was at uni in a rep came to the door asking if i wanted to sign up for services i asked for some more information they asked for a name and address to send information to a few weeks later i received a letter stating my installation and activation date i called virgin media who informed me that id signed up for services on the date of the rep visit i cancelled without issue eventually after a long time in call queues and on hold i assume the rep was paid per signup though did wonder how many people were scammed this few years ago i signed up for virgin media as bt at the time were quite a bit more expensive in comparison the savings and time eroding my memory outweighed the bitter taste from the last encounter we had virgin services for just over years including during the pandemic the service was ok strangely the mbps service we had felt slower than the mbps we had previously with bt months into our most recent contract we moved home which didnt happen to be in a virgin area when we called to cancel we were informed there would be a penalty charge to exit the contract earlier effectively the monthly charge for the remainder of the contract this came as a surprise as sky and bt would cancel services without charge when moving home regardless if they could provide a service we asked for another solution but virgin media couldnt offer anything not even an adsl solution at the new address they clearly didnt care we paid the fee and made a complaint in writing a couple of months later we received a completely dispassionate and probably letter stating that we agreed to the exit fee in our recently my wife has received a letter from a debt collection agency about a virgin media debt from years ago stating she owes with an account number a date and no other context i was living with her at the time and we did not have any virgin services or accounts at that time let alone any accounts that were not settled i assume theyve falsely attributed someone elses debt to her and sold it to a debt collection agency now she will have to contact them and fight this debt claim over virgin medias poor account management advice to anyone thats considering using virgin media avoid them regardless of how much cheaper they my seem,Bad
2357,unable to cancel my contract at contract end date please cancel my contract as your customer service cant help number ending in call me as keep getting cut off after minutes on hold edit webchat cant help as they are untrained in the cancellation process so im going to have to cancel my direct debit as i cant cancel and you are taking more out my bank than the contract amount stressing hell,Bad
2358,on the phone my problem was not resolved no available for days now nothing wrong with phone or internet so the box obviously needs replacing,Bad
2359,hi there thanks so much for taking the time to write a review were really glad things are going well and you are happy with the service you are,Bad
2360,if i could i would give zero star this is the worst provider ever my contact ended years ago and was still being charged a month even after calling them and cancelling even requested a pac code to move to better provider i was told i do t need to worry about being charged since ive requested a pac code and contacted them they keep taking my money down for no reason and the worst is theres a phone number on there that doesnt belong to me or any of my family yet kept being charged this is the worst providers honestly save your money with simone else its been years that im trying to leave and they keep giving the same f excuse avoid them,Bad
2361,was told moving over to virgin media was going to be cheaper and they would contact my current provider to let them know of the switch they didnt i was getting billed by both companies i called to complain to virgin media and they have put me on hold to their customer services currently been on hold over minutes on a saturday afternoon when i have better things to do foreign call centre that were really hard to understand useless service im staying with they have great customer service and uk based call centres,Bad
2362,here is the act like your best friend when they want your act rude and offhand when you need to cancel and they try and avoid giving you your pac code your legal answer quickly when you want to answer slowly and keep you on hold to was going to stay but because of their attitude i went to a cheaper rival,Bad
2363,i was chatting to an agent to request a new router it took me half a hour to get through to the agent on what i require as a loyal customer i find it a very bad,Bad
2364,absolute rubbish service if i could give zero i would we have been without broadband for nearly weeks and after a visit from one of their so called engineers we now have no landline either they have now been supposedly sorting out this problem on occasions and failed miserably each time sick of having to ring them up and getting no where would not recommend bt at all,Bad
2365,the worst customer service i have ever experienced spent hr mins on the phone costing nearly spent mins another night and over mins the next day most of the time spent on hold dealt with around different people totally incompetent nice and manager who did ring me back fair play but this was after id been onto them for over mins was then on hold for mins eventually had to hang up because i was due back off my lunch no courtesy call back from the manager without doubt the worst customer service ive ever experienced,Bad
2366,i set up a christmas special offer for e a month calls messages and internet wich was great i set up a direct debit that didnt work so everytime it doesnt work you get a penalty of additional e even though my bank told me there were no restrictions and it should go through virgin media kept telling me that they dont know why is it happening finally i switched to irish bank account that failed again i called up the bank they told me there are no restrictions on the account and that they dont even see an attempt of charging my card from virgin media so after i talked to my bank i called virgin media and they said that the payments dont go through because of regulatory reasons when i asked what are regulatory reasons they said they can not divulge that information so i ended up paying now e more for months now im sure im not the only and unreliable,Bad
2367,internet bills everything about them is avoid avoid avoid youll only regret it if you dont,Bad
2368,pity that you can give no stars as that would be even too much i have never had to put up with such horrendous service it is amazing that any customers remain i havent enought time space or energy to go into the number of times i have had to call to get premium spotify installed and which i was paying for months also the number of times i have called to simply transfer a number from one payee to another whist staying with easier to leave and save the hassle,Bad
2369,still havent resolved an internal issue with my contract where they are constantly over charging me by about a month its been months of constant phone call and agro please think twice before signing up to this company my phones in my husbands name as it was a gift and even though hes added me on it they still wont do anything unless hes here and he works away i wouldnt have minded so much if they resolved it the first time but calls later its still going on,Bad
2370,me again i utterly sympathise with people who are at a disadvantage w talktalk as it seems theres no end to their bill arrives which im expecting as i have called about the ominous text messages about overdue bills even when i know the line has been disconnected and a final bill was bill says charges less a credit of leaving a total of you wouldnt guess it owing the bill is very simple and to the point but the easy maths is just wrong now i know what it is trying to say as the disconnection and billing dates didnt align there is bound to be a final balancing payment due so just produce a bill that says that at least this process has taught me one thing i am never going to use tt for my own broadband the whole bereavement process has been unnecessarily complex needed keeping on top of and generally inaccurate and the majority of messages had to be ignored or were not timely and had been will say you can get through to the bereavement line and their treatment is sympathetic but not backed up by any sensible or efficient processes,Bad
2371,signed up for a new contract no signal ever cant get through to a team member was told a manager would call me back after waiting on hold for hour no one ever did,Bad
2372,bad in every the box on the front of my house whilst i was out when i requested it to be on the side told the salesman and engineer who installed both called in front of me and gave dates when somebody will come to move it year in still not moved internet is shocking i asked for help they says its fine i asked for somebody to cone out they asked for to move box and check internet so want me to pay for their faults i have since fixed the internet issue myself but buying a new wire for this company is great at selling but the aftercare for current customer is shocking in everyway possible ignored emails facebook and instagram messages when i finally got in touch on the phone staff were all rude and didnt want to help in anyway at least sky try and keep you,Bad
2373,bad and poor customer service expensive and poor signals,Bad
2374,awful company awful service avoid avoid avoid,Bad

2376,intermittent loss of tv and broadband for about the last months in our area my partner works from home so it has been a nightmare had to purchase an ee g router to use as backup but this is not cheap not a happy customer,Bad
2377,wish id read up before joining a friend recommended them joined in september days the internet was down in the first month not just us but whole area customer service is abysmal no understanding no solutions or sticking to promises made second month in and again we have consistent inconsistency with service going down i live in york so hardly the back and beyond was told auto compensation will adjust bills accordingly which was a lie it took an hour and four different people to get any compensation two months later a measly weeks off next bill was sorted not enough when you think of the cost of netflix apple music amazon prime video now tv that you cant now access for month in and again numerous days of internet poor customer service im trying to leave via breach of contract on their part,Bad
2378,today i cannot buy additional data because their website has an error on the add data page tried to top up instead which is more expensive asda took my payment but did not give the top up a few months ago had another error bought a bundle it took my money but did not give me the bundle when i started with asda it took my money x their website is trash the customer support on the phone is good by the way they usually add correct what is missing you can also top up buy an addon by calling a number that works and is quick still odd for a large company to have a faulty website,Bad

2380,this was still rejected extremely poor customer claim for a new phone months old was rejected due to me not contacting them within the days this was my letter explaining my circumstances this letter and my appeal was then again rejected when asking to speak to a manager i was told he cant help you and then left on hold for minutes i also said another would buy out my contract after or so year of being with orange they replied ok do it i feel this is an absolutly unacceptable way to deal with loyal customers and i expected better i would like to appeal against your decision to reject my claim for mitigating first and foremost the main reason i did not make a claim immediately was due to the fact i was travelling and there was no suitable time for delivery i thought it didnt make sense to order a phone when i had no clear date for delivery i was unaware of the time scale for making a claim as i do not have a paper copy of my contract to refer back to as i normally renew my contract over the phonei was also confused by the time scale as the last time i made a claim it was after days i was also unaware that the circumstances change when you are abroad therefor knowing i had done it before i did not see why waiting to make the claim was an is upsetting also that this handset and previous claim was made a mere six months ago and the handset is already unusable i would particularly like to fight my case here as on february the th i did in fact go into an ee store westmorland shopping centre in kendal and discuss with a female member of staff my best options for replacing the phone whether this be through orange care or under samsung warranty as i have only had the handset six months this was still an option i was advised which ever option i chose i would have to pay the same fee and it would be quicker and more direct to claim through orange insurance at this point i do feel very strongly that it the clauses of the contact were repeated and i was made sure i was aware and told that i had to claim within seven days if this had been the case i would have made the claim there and then in the shop i do feel that is is important for staff to be knowledgeable on company policies to help consumers like me in these situations if the staff are not aware then this critical information can not be passed onto customers although this was not logged onto a computer i was given a new full battery so as i could use my mobile phone this information will hopefully correspond to the battery originally sent out with my phone to back me up i do feel with all this in place that it is slightly unfair to have rejected my claim and i am quite happy to pay the access fee for a new one i have been an orange customer for the past five years as has my father we both rack up rather large bills at times and i also have orange home broadband with you i have paid for insurance ever since i took my first contract out with orange and me and my family have shown a large amount of loyalty to your company in return i do not feel i have been given the service quality i pay for and with that much dedication i feel there should have been some leeway in my claim my father was very unhappy with the decision and complained to orange stating he would be happy to change network the reply from an orange team member was thats fine ok i dont feel this is the customer service or loyalty by the company we deserve for networking with orange all these years i hope you can understand why i am disappointed within the company and service and prove these acceptable reasons for not making a claim sooner and allow me to order a new handset many thanks,Bad

2438,when i initially tried to order the router the company couldnt deliver it to me for weeks and after long fights with customer support they somehow agreed to deliver it to my that they were bombarding me with lots of spam deals and promotional was the moment i decided to leave as soon as i move to another i decided to move out i had days of calls with customer support trying to figure out the total breakdown of payments for breaking the contract nobody could answer that cause there are fees for breaking the contract for day notice period and lots of other hidden fees they could only tell me the full price if i decide to proceed with the cancellation cause the price is overall counted by the system they have no control the leaving process was really complicated everyone asks you the reason and tries to push you to other deals all the time they even caught me with that instead of cancelling my account straight away they subscribed it to cancellation when somebody else moves in had to call and push on cancelling my account once again spending mins on this company at all costs if possible theyre the second virgin media,Bad

2521,my with ee has been utterly horrifying from the very start first the mobile i got with them did not have any service so it was pretty much pointless to have a phone in the first place it took them months to exchange it to a working one which caused a lot of trouble as well i got an ipad from them just because it seemed like a good deal but they suspended my account in the first month after they took the payment on the date not agreed and there wasnt enough money in the account since then they claim they contacted me so much they had to take the matters to the debt collection agency but in face they were calling a number they generated purely for the purpose of the ipad which in no way was collected to my existing account or my real mobile number they also failed to update my address after i moved even though i asked them to do so twice and told me its my fault that i didnt do it over the online service which of course doesnt work utterly st dont ever do any business with them i really hope they go bankrupt soon,Bad

2524,i have been a loyal customer of ee for several years during my last upgrade in november rather than change my device i maintained my old android device and negotiated a cheaper tariff tailored to suit my needs my month plan from november to november as stated in the contract should be per month however ee has hiked the price up on two occasions now over above the price plan i signed up for and it is now per month the st increase taking place just a few months after activating the new month plan i contacted ee yesterday and was informed every financial year the prices increase it beggars belief that they can manipulate plan prices by over when the customer has not signed up for this and if i choose to cancel my plan early i will incur a penalty charge it is sneaky and underhanded other service providers do not do this and if so certainly not to this excess ee told me there is nothing they could do when my plan ends in november i will be closing my account and signing up with three mobile who offer a similar plan for less and who do not deviate from the contracted plan price every april at such an inflated amount as ee does ee are offering new customers the same plan i am on at but are charging me a loyal long time customer it seems they entice customers at an attractive price and when you are committed they whack their prices up arbitrarily not honouring the contracted amount steer clear of ee other mobile telephone companies offer more attractive offers,Bad
2525,rude bt wanted to find out what options i had with bt to upgrade my current contract so i can pay them more i asked about any fees they might have in place in case i want to change suppliers she quoted a horror of exit fees then before i could respond she hung up on me well the online equivalent of that,Bad

2532,i am angry at ee i had a contract with them for sim card and mifi i have moved abroad so i was not about to use the mifi device when i have called ee to cancel that contract they said i have to pay about pounds cancelation fee which is way overpaid as they have included the months i have left on the contract x so it works out that the cancelation fee itself is pounds this wouldnt be such an issue as i have terminated contract sooner and as i am abroad they just took the advantage of me needing to cancel it fair enough you know how to play your game but this is not what is upsetting me the most before all this happened i have also ordered a gb router device to have at home asking if it can be sort of swapped for the mifi device so i wouldnt have to pay the cancellation fee i have been told it is not possible ok maybe you dont allow it but try to think about adding it into your policies as anywhere else they allow it it is called a customer service search it in the dictionary so i have spoken to my brother that hed take charge of that router so i have called the ee that i would like to transfer the router to my brother as i was moving abroad the next day ee called me that they can give me a discount and send me a new better router i have agreed as it was a discounted monthly price so when my brother and i called the ee to make the transfer of the new router to my brothers name they did do that with us saying that we need to send the old router back we did that but to my surprise i have found out that both me and my brother are paying for it even though it is just one product when i called to find out what have happened i have been told that allegedly we have sent the wrong router back we made sure it is the old one i know that they have the wrong router to my brother hence they think it is the wrong router that we sent back but still we both pay pounds a month even though we only have one device when i ask them how is this possible they say that it hasnt been yet and so the system still thinks we have routers what the hell do not use ee they dont care about any customer service they just want to take all your money btw when i ask to speak to a manager they only tell that the manager will tell you the same and never let you speak with absolutely terrible it was the greatest mistake i have ever done to simply say i have paid over pounds so far for products i dont have or use for last two months,Bad

2558,a truly shocking level of customer service rude arrogant deceitful and lazy i absolutely ever recommend this company to anyone heres reasons why you suck when i signed up to them i had to wait three weeks for the service to be installed the installation engineer didnt turn up representative then very swiftly changed their tone from friendly and to sceptical and as apparently they were certain the engineer had turned up i was then told i would have to pay for a new installation a few days later i was then informed that i was correct the engineer had in fact not turned up i was given a months free internet great by this point i had already paid for a month of no internet huge delays from the start the engineer turns up a week later a week earlier than i just so happened to be in and so the installation happened by pure luck i was pointlessly a router as i was told it would be more suited for the requirements i had multiple users etc turns out that was just a total waste of money and a lie in my area the speeds that can provide are extremely low yet every other isp can provide great speeds and for less money they claim i will get mbps download speed not once have i and even that is a shockingly low number i have tested the speeds on multiple devices around the home and on different days the average speed is mbps if im lucky and no i dont live in a shanty town thats just home telecom for you they help to provide a truly nostalgic experience with these low speeds its like im back in the early s twice now ive requested my original contract from them it still hasnt been sent across their customer service department have the necessary functions of a phone operative they can hear speak and type but they dont actually seem to listen nor have any comprehension nor compassion toward the matter at hand responding to my issues with a barrage of arbitrary agreement noises mmmm and mmm hmmmm real oscar winning performances truly palpable stuff on a number of occasions now i have been on the phone to their technical services department the experience is always as satisfying and as useful as a punch to my own face a consistently pointless effort and im just fed a scripted line along the lines of yeah these speeds are actually ok for where you are what a professional i would also like to add that they are not open on the weekends during all of this still have the audacity to email and call me trying to upgrade me to their other packages guys please this is too much my sides sadly i will most likely have to upgrade lol to these more premium just in the hope that i have borderline reliable internet services to use i take great pleasure in knowing that companies like this wont be able to operate in the same way once the much needed gdpr are brought in to action this company gains new custom through buying data from estate agents not from word of mouth or even basic advertising fingers crossed they go bust so that my contract is cancelled prospective buyers go elsewhere,Bad
2559,been waiting for months for the phone line and everytime engineer comes theres always something going on with the line and etc and ive been told itll fixed at the th but then im told that theres a delay so if i hear another bullshit going around this horrendous company im moving to sky or virgin i reccomend you not to rely on bt when you move to a new build house absolute,Bad
2560,recently i visited the o swindon showroom for getting an o postpaid sim connection just five months before only i moved from france to the a part of my my main motive for the o was to increase my credit score but it was one of the worst decisions because due to their check of my credit score i lost credit score within min also the respective o staff fromthe swindon me that they are gonna do a hard check that is also multiple i dont know how it makes sense to do multiple credit checks and related point loss within a short time within minutes from the same agency now it will take at year to recover and now it is adversely affecting my life i tried to contact o customer care so many times and no all so i would say stay away from o and their awful service,Bad
2561,when i finally decided to leave virgin they were made life hell and finally threatened to ruin my credit rating and ability to get a won my case at but with delayed compensation from their side listen to money box on radio for more information on how they operate and steer clear try utility warehouse or any other before going with these bela thanks for replying sadly the saga continues and after being awarded compensation the virgin team only sent a cheque for half of this so i am still chasing and being let down fyi when i moved to uw they managed all the switches for all my utilities but refused to deal with virgin as the track record is awful for making things difficult my experience confirms this sadly but was worse due to the threats made to me by the staff on the phone i doubt your reply can remedy something that is systemic within the virgin organisation which is why it got the attention from radio i will update as and when the compensation is paid in full however note i never got an apology for the unfounded threats,Bad
2562,if i could give no stars i the moment i took out the contract they have tried to con me out of more am finally leaving them today and good would urge nobody to join this company as they are unhelpful bad service poor speeds and bye bt and i will never return,Bad
2563,only gave star due to there being no option to vote stars rang virgin media last week and explained my current provider is unable to accomodate the sheer size of my property and connectivity was extremely awful it was explicitly explained to the rep on the phone how big the house was and not to accept me as a new customer if they feel they cant provide solutions to deal with the range of the connectivity the rep explained that their wifi broadband will be okay in the house and the engineer who comes to install the hardware will not leave the property until all are covered and there is no connectivity issues the engineer arrived lazy and disgustingly for the job i was promised on the phone that boosters would be provided and the engineer had told us that he had no boosters in the van we have a big house and unfortunately will have to live and deal with the internet issues wasnt even hours after installation had to ring virgin to explain we are getting no wifi signal around the house and need to stand right near the hub in order to get one they said they will send an engineer out that very evening waited nothing instead the next morning we received a parcel containing a virgin signal booster so we asked for an engineer was guaranteed one the same day but sent a booster instead to replace the engineer booster was no help and rang back virgin who to my surprise informed the boosters are on a rental basis of per month something i was not even but just arrived on my doorstep the rep on the phone was extremely rude and i asked her to escalate the call which she refused at first until i explained my consumer rights which allows me to legally escalate a call to a senior member of a customer service team she then transferred the manager apologised and said he would transfer the call to the networking team but instead hung up on me do not use virgin avoid at all costs their customer service only exists in the purchasing phase after youve signed the deal the customer service becomes,Bad
2564,very lame disappointing customer service been using it for almost year half in the first after installing their home broadband didnt had a connection for more than weeks while reaching out to customer service they keep hanging me out with technical issues engineer came couple of days said its a router issue help me changed the router after days and engineer came after days said its fine but it didnt worked and reached out to customer service through chat its laughable they asked me to reset turn off the power switch on checked if the wiring was in correct place hence forth so what was their engineer doing all this timei asked them if they not going to charge me for all this time but nope they still charged me from the very first day of contract fine at least ive the wifi at home and now not now for past few months they have hiked up the price of the contract when i asked them whats the point of having a contract if you going to hike the prices in the middle of contract then the explanation was due to the inflation needed to upgrade their fiber all that cause their other parties are charging more now why do i want to hear all these crap told them i want to terminate the contract they came back by saying they made a mistake will try to rectify it by offering full fiber but i need to sign another contract for months again why on earth i would fall for this again promised me this that but not to leave them or else i would end up paying early termination the point of having a contract explanation was customers need to abide by their conditions but not them the provider they have different contracts one is fixed the one i had was variable contract never heard of such things in my years asked them why didnt they mention before my contract then the response was if i were to offer you the contract i could had asked you or explain but unfortunately that wasnt me off completely and after all this convo they were still asking is there anything else i can do for you told them not in my another life i know they trying to be nice but no ever again lessons learned,Bad
2565,awful tech to customer service noone seems to have a clue they have messed up my new fibre swapped on to new from them so nothing to do as fibre all set up with nothing working so i now have to somehow have to work from home with no internet or phone line after over hrs on the phone today with being passed to multiple different people im told i have no phone line with fibre wasnt processed so i have to cancel and set up a new contract with them to be able to receive it bizarrely this will take days to cancel a non existing line which i will have to pay for then wait for an engineer to set a new line up so i cant even get a new provider for days either as they can take over the line talk talk say they havent got avoid at all costs,Bad
2566,i was contacted by virgin without any requesting anything from them promoting a new deal for existing customers to upgrade my services i have subsequently received a bill for the full amount without any discount or deal being applied virgin help if you can call it this cannot explain why even after sending them the confirmation of the offer i received utterly useless helpdesk who know nothing about existing offers i am still disputing this across all channels with no success apparently they record their sales calls if this was the case it would be a simple exercise to learn the lies and deceit they have spouted forth and still refuse to honour even after giving them proof of the offer i was given lying distrustful incompetent organisation all round add to this the poor internet with the signal constantly dropping the tivo box freezing and there isnt much good that can be said about this woefully untruthful organisation they shouldnt even receive star,Bad

2571,my mother had virgin at her home her bill kept creeping up to the point where she couldnt afford it i called up to cancel for her and they advised that if the bill goes in my name it would reduce her has recently passed away so i have canceled the service and they want their equipment back after plus phone calls to advise them that it needs to be collected from my address and not the address it was installed at not person has sent the return packaging to my address it continues to go to my mums address which obviously there is nobody there i called up today to make a complaint and they have no complaints number or email just ignorant customer services staff who are unhelpful guy called lee scottish bloke wouldnt raise a complaint for me wouldnt give me his full name to raise a complaint about him wouldnt raise a complaint for me mid way through the conversation but then at the end said that he dont have a complaints department because the cost of staffing it would probably send them into bankruptcy with all the complaints theyd receive absolute joke of a company useless staff who cannot even jot down a simple address causing undue stress and anxiety avoid these guys like mins after writing this review i get an email saying thank you for your complaint this has not been tf has this been resolved your piece of junk equipment is still at my house incompetent th speaking to lee who assured me he had sent the packaging out for me to return the router phone calls later he never actually sent the packaging out like he said he had according to the last person i spoke to i spoke to someone else after speaking to lee and they assured me they would send the packaging out days later its still not here and ive been told that it hasnt been sent out by the last person i spoke to before that id rather catch than have to deal with these inadequate people anymore,Bad

2573,vodafone has one of the vilest stupidest most inane communications setup for their customers i have ever encountered if not for the fact that we were in a rush and had to get internet i would never go anywhere near them again for any form of service is outsourced abroad to poor people who have to deal with customers who will mostly be incensed after being forced to navigate a complex web of passive aggressive automated responses when you do get through locally uk the ones who pick up really do not give a st do other stupid things like send you an email with your account details ask you to activate the account but somehow lock you out of it and then you have to spend minutes calling them to find out that because your service isnt live yet you cant log in what on earth is the point of that email with my account details have absolutely no goodwill towards this company left and weve only just begun our contract i will actively go out of my way to tell anyone to avoid vodafone at all costs so they dont have to experience anything similar to what we have already encountered i can barely imagine what customer service will be like in the event of any service outage good grief,Bad

2599,ac number has to be the worst company i have ever dealt with i am in my second property that vodafone have been my broadband supplier both properties have been small flats and each time the broadband only works in the room the modem is in and will reach no further although in my current flat it is much worse i cannot get the internet to pick up now tv when my tv is right next to the modem and laptops only work if an ethernet cable is connected from laptop to modem i have phoned numerous times no notes are kept of previous calls and i have to start from the beginning again on each call furthermore i go through set up changes with them and they promise to phone back but have only phoned back twice and given that i have phoned times this is not good and i am paying for a very substandard broadband and service i have all internal connections checked as vodafone were going to charge me just for a call out and connections are the last call i had resulted in vodafone offering me broadband extenders for free which i accepted only to have the customer service advisor hang up on me rather than transfer me through i have complained many times over the last year but the broadband they offer is complete and utter rubbish they do not support and help only reason i went with vodafone was because they said they could transfer our landline number but it then turned out they couldnt and we had a lot of wasted business should have phoned back when they hanged up on me but to be honest i just want rid of this shoddy company and did not want to extend my contract with them which is what they do everytime you change vodafone are awful,Bad
2600,o customer services are awful to ring them i have had to lie to get them to answer the phone by telling them my phone as been stolen other wise you are automatically cut off been given the wrong information from the end i had to claim on my insurance from o which were excellent to deal with but cost me due to the sheer from o customer services they promised stuff but still not been delivered awful service i could go on but o are just a awful company and have no care whats so ever for customers very quick to answer the phone to buy or upgrade but useless otherwise,Bad
2601,dont listen to complaints and the prices are becoming expensive when trying to cancel they decided to put me into a new contract without me knowing,Bad
2602,youll see my previous review below unfortunately theyve now ruined thati wrote to them by post to ask them to cancel my contract with plenty of notice saying they were free to end the service immediately as i already had a new sim the initial response was to ask me to call them instead taking time out of my working day to do so i was told the service would end and given a pac was also texted a pac code saying if i didnt use it within days theyd carry on billing me i have no idea why they would think thats okay when i asked them to cancel the contract nevertheless i made sure to hand over the pac code over to my new provider within enough more than a month after i ask for the service to stop ee are still billing me the unexpected payment has taken me into an overdraft meaning i am charged a day in top of the line rental they emailed to complain if i get the funds and the a day back i will improve the rating a star or two at least i had some signal unlike with vodafone im unlikely to use the company again though and will make sure i let my family and friends know of the experience having used at least mobile phone companies over the last years o is the only one who hasnt pulled something like this so ill be sticking with so frustrating how often these huge companies just screw you over knowing there is nothing you can actually do about it the less competition in the industry and fewer companies the worse the customer service is the mobile phone market is a prime example as with broadband buying a carpet or a bike or groceries i still have the option of going to a local shop paying the little bit extra and getting the customer service and trustworthiness i expect the annoying thing is that with things like broadband and mobiles the government makes sure you cant through limiting the licensing reviewi moved from vodafone after really shoddy service and took out a business package through the carphone warehouse i was a little nervous as i have only ever had a good experience with bt and virgin when it comes to mobiles with friends telling me that virgin werent great ee for over two years now my signals fine i do live in brighton so cant vouch for the service elsewhere but vodafone service wasnt great even in a sizeable city like thisi have spoken to the customer services maybe three times and theyve been available quickly and helpful each timei have to acknowledge that the true test comes when you want to cancel a contract but so far ive been happy with the experience,Bad
2603,never use this have been left shocked and upset after using this they use nhs discounts as a means of getting they did not actually apply the discount i signed up they did not cancel my contract and continued to take money from my they will not pay the money back th the customer service is atrocious they are unhelpful and extremely rude,Bad
2604,honestly close them down and call it a day better service at i have been trying for days to get hold of anyone with a human voice to order a land line for my elderly mother cant email no one answers calls after mins on hold no online chat maybe this is the norm for big companies up and looked elsewhere sorry bt you have lost the plot and clearly dont care about your existing and potential new customers,Bad
2605,probably the worst customer service relationship since ive lived in the uk years long response time endless chain of identity confirmations no desire to solve the problem an agent like working from home contact during a commercial break of the series or during a lunch break i am very dissatisfied,Bad
2606,broadband is their mbps tariff speed tests show the speed is fine but the ping is terrible every website loads sooooo slow loads the pages with no images and you have to refresh times tried to log into the router and reset it unplugged it changed dns settings still bad avoid poor customer service tech support aswell they dont know what theyre doing,Bad
2607,must be one of the worst companies to work with they dont even deserve star i have spent over hours on the phone with bt since september and they too cant get any sense from the engineer came to install our phone and internet but hadnt pulled the wire through to the house the engineer to do that arrived hour later now i am being told they need to send a i want is an engineer to get a wire from the box attached to the outside of my house inside and connect of bt advisors have been good and mark from the moving team has rung each day from last week about am to update me when hes not on strike they review cases on monday so being on strike means another wait its about time lost their monopoly on telephone line installation as they are rubbish,Bad
2608,just awful awful up my bill in august said they would resolve it but again in september said theyd resolve it two hours to connect on an online chat today minutes into the chat with a response every twenty minutes or so and just no understanding of really really awful customer support,Bad
2609,making us wait days for our internet because of there mistake but also ruining our old wifi so it is not sign up for bt,Bad

2612,terrible intermittent service still waiting for an engineer with no wifi,Bad
2613,awful service pay more get less,Bad
2614,absolutely awful network the worst customer service charged pound and no explanation given con merchants,Bad
2615,in august i received a call saying ive gone over data by gb so i asked to take it further after they was asking for quite a big bill off me so from august it took them till mid september to ring me back i was letting them know that i called the customer service in in july stating i have had a text message saying i was one day into my allowance and i had used all of my data so i rang up the company and was advised that i was still okay to use my phone the same text come through in august so i went into my local store bootle liverpool and the women advised me the same without looking on my account ect so after a few months they looked into my phone call to their customer service and said they was in the wrong and crushed the bill for july but sadly i still have a big bill for august as their is no evidence of me going into the shop so after many trips to the shop and phone called to the vodafone team their is nothing they can do as the shop is reliable for this and they are saying that they cant do nothing cause they cant accept my account and will not claim liability after months i rang them up to see if they can sort it out and still no look got a male telling me that they cant do anything about going over data plan so i explained what happened and he was having no off it after me telling him they that had already squashed one bill ive tried speaking to a manager sleep but you must need a loyalty card or something cause you can never get to speak to them so in mid january nearly and still not sorted been with them for years never missed a bill never went over my contact even when i was on a lower data plan i have contacts with them and im not happy with their customer service im also still paying my monthly bill of and im blocked from using my internet so im paying for it and not getting to use it please hope everyone get to see this as they are the worst company to use they even blacklisted me to other companies cause of the bill watch out they are one big scam,Bad
2616,customer service is terrible they dont listen and are rude i cant wait to leave i have sim and broadband and they dont seem to care if u leave or not,Bad
2617,dear richard all your customers service save yourself some money and you will find your operation run as smooth as admire you as a person but staff at is letting you down badly they simply havent got a clue service is rubbish i am having problem with my home move had to call them a few times but customer service dont seem to understand the problem asked me the same questions again and again and worse still same question over and over again i got transferred from department to department then department after all the security questions got put back to department again for every transfer i got asked who i was confirm my details account no address passwords must have spoke to or individuals on the call today spreading over hour problem is an engineer appointment today which no one turned up i called them at noon and the operator still told me someone was coming phoned them up and asked for a reason got told that is not needed why did they tell me just an hour someone was coming despite all these calls i have made hours spent talking to useless people i still have no broadband no tv no phone line shame,Bad
2618,ive never found it so difficult to speak directly with a company o have a minute wait on answering calls even at am when they open eventually got through to someone to disconnect and i was offered a token upgrade which meant i would be locked into a year contract with a phone that was more than likely to be rendered obsolete within a year thanks to apples constant ios updates and a battery which is notoriously badly designed and made i will be looking elsewhere since they seem to be on a downward spiral of neglecting customer care for the sake of cutting costs we all know what that leads to more leaving less profits made more cost saving excercises leading to more customer dissatisfaction and more customers leaving,Bad
2619,i pay for wifi and dont get wifi i have to use my g,Bad
2620,custome for about year and renew the contract two days back and instead having broadband speed faster and over but last two days just get around mb service and over the phone try to blame me and talking nonsense this is to loyal customer for nine talktalk please blame customer for your poor service team and very bad is dont understand simple conversation and they can they help or repair my chat and different information technical team lost too as they play with when it will needs to update as even hear they say contact all lost the servicei feel cheated from over mb day before and sign new contract then down to to chat or call so many time and when you will get to over mb promise in the contract god bless to your or you do not have was on phone with helpline over hour and with engineer two hour but can not get speed what i contract for but still helpline not sort thing to get phone from them today but no luck as not receive phone from many many test but so solution regulator needs to strict on issue on broadband speed as as got reply from talktalk social media team contact very very poor service,Bad
2621,told twice my payment had been rejected then received text from royal mail saying my parcel was on its way,Bad
2622,internet is down for more than h the customer service is telling a different story every time no way to get out of contract without paying the service though i pay for it,Bad
2623,not even had the service installed yet but already experienced rubbish service and nonsensical default ttb choose to send you a paper invoice as opposed to electronic and they charge plus vat for this it doesnt matter whether you want it or not there is no way of changing it until youve received the first invoice a classic catch it cannot be either online or by their customer services i tried both and the latter via chat was a painful expereince with a complete lack of clarity talking about stuff that made no sense as they chose to not explain the above they just assume that every customer knows that we havent emailed invoices out for two years how on earth would a new customer know this day and age where everyone is trying to be green and look after the planet its a disgrace for any company to default to sending paper invoices out and then charge you extra for it with no ability to disable until youve already received one invoice and paid extra for it fuming,Bad
2624,away i have no idea how they are still in the business,Bad
2625,contacting virgini left a review on here a few days ago and i had a reply from lets not read the review and state the obvious kath well kath i took your suggestion and called the number you supplied and followed the online help which didnt help in anyway shape or form and im still in the same situation i have spent another minutes wasting my life for virgin to tell me that even though i waited the day cancellation period i am still getting charge the early cancellation fee only a manager can change this and yet again i cant get to speak to them so kath do you have any other patronising suggestions that make it out to be me not doing enough to sort this out this company is a joke,Bad
2626,give up all hope of receiving great customer service when you deal with virgin media expect long wait times language barriers poor communication and a lot of transferring to different depts very poor service and the management admitted today they know how bad they are imaging knowing youre bad and not wanting to fix it apathy and dreadful service its time ofcom looked at braking up their monopoly on fibre broadband,Bad
2627,wouldnt even rate this one star if i had a choice by far the worst service i have ever received in my life,Bad
2628,awful wifi hasnt been working for over a week now ive had over hour long conversations with different agents to try and resolve it and no one has resolved is affecting my work as i have to work from home and costing me a fortune in g you cant even email to make a complaint takes about minutes over the phone to even speak to someone,Bad
2629,how dumb can an agent agent dealt well with my questions i told them to wait mins while i decide to extend for another months and the fool kills the chat didnt give me notice or apologise disgusted get in touch talktalk or i go to a can see your generic reply zack but i can prove with the chat log i saved that your colleague did intentionally leave the chat if you care to review it yourself before blindly replying and i told you to contact me and you have completely ignored me your online trustpilot team equally as useless a second webchat failed because from durban south africa manager refused to accept my security question answers due to the way they were formatted what a set of jokers you lot are,Bad
2630,i got a box in december the house i moved into but i didnt start to use the broadband yet because i had to do work to the house and its like a building site as i didnt attend to do that much work to the house i was told to send the broadband box back and pay today it near broke my heart all that money for nothing,Bad
2631,the sales team bent over backwards to accommodate my new custom they were polite eager to please and made me an offer which i felt i could not refuse afraid it went down hill rapidly from that point promised a call from an engineer on the saturday to discuss the suitability within our home this visit was free of charge and then once i was completely satisfied i could go ahead and have it installed on the following arrived on saturday so i called customer services and instantly realised i was attitude of the call handler and the many call handlers that followed highlighted immense issues for me red flags to match the vm was told that the appointment had been changed and rescheduled for my knowledge and without my consent for an alternative suitable date very matter of fact and they could do nothing about it its happened and tough get on with it no consideration for the inconvenience and lack of communication hours later costing me a fortune i persisted and eventually got offered for the would not even cover my call i declined and asked them to cancel everything no trust in this company and their incompetent customer service departments in india atrocious service beyond anything i have ever tried conversing on their chat line which remained open for hours with no support so i just closed this place in the chat line services that you are interested in purchasing their products and i was answered within one minute vm prioritise sales over their customers i thought i would search tp thinking perhaps this was a one off not im going back to sky,Bad
2632,cancelled a phone contract months ago when the phone smashed o asked for to settle the account bought a new phone and sim with another company had letters from o demanding payments started at then then now threats of legal action this a month after their complaints dept courtney kaye had said sorry and supposedly written off these false debts have written more letters but not getting any answers just more threats of legal action,Bad
2633,the worst customer service on the planet totally unhelpful i was forced to join vodafone because they are the only provider with mobile signal around where i work hence i had to leave amazing o to join vodafone please dont if you as a customer have a option of any other provider please use them even tho vodafone might be slightly cheaper for a like for like contract its not worth it so stay away unless you have no other choice like myself they couldnt get my number ported for days since i joined so my phone was not useable then the system shows that i had used gb of data when i couldnt even use my mobile after that i got passed on to different teams within vodafone was on the call for min to be told in simple terms too bad we think you have used it so i strongly recommend avoid joining vodafone because if you ever want to resolve something using customer service it wont happen that doesnt exist one agent mentioned they would credit me some money for the days inconvenience caused it hasnt happened so on the same min long conversation when i mentioned this i was told sorry no notes left by any agent about this so we cannot do anything about it i really hope this helps customers to stay away from joining this network provider,Bad
2634,once again the runaround,Bad
2635,worst company i have ever deal with i signed up to a contract which offer an introductory discount after i had placed my order virgin media did not honour the discount i complained multiple times and these emails contained cut and paste responses but nothing helpful they said they were unable to find anything which confirmed the offer on their end and after sending them a copy of the contract they had sent to me they ignored my emails in addition they repeatedly got my name wrong in the replies on webchat and some emails i asked for a letter of deadlock which was ignored and i asked them to cancel my services which they also ignored luckily i have now managed to cancel my contract via a telephone call which was also unnecessarily complicated but i have learnt my lesson do not go with the cheapest company they are cheap for a reason it is worth it to pay a bit extra to get good customer servicei am also in the process of complaining to as virgin media are knowingly falsely advertising their products,Bad

2655,talk online is a real waste of time and resources this time it took an hour of chat to get absolutely nowhere previous times it has been longer the staff dont seem to understand the problems though it is explained numerous times so end up passing the chat to someone else more explaining i eventually got a phone number to explained and dealt with in minutes get rid of the chat centre and put humans back on the a very linda clifton,Bad

2660,not so super fibre deal been with bt several months now first week super fibre was great then gradually got worse wife and kids not happy with the wifi speed so me thinking give it time to bed in it didnt work as we thought it should or expected so after several months i contacted bt last night for this guy to tell me that i will need an ethernet cable so i was explaining to him that the package i purchased said that i could run items including gaming consoles so i felt like i was being off and in a roundabout way also being told to spend more money without actually using those words so when i told him that he didnt like and said to me basically thats my problem and asked to speak to a manager so he put me on hold and after several minutes he came back on and said that a manager would ring me back within a couple of hours no one has rang me back yet so will ring them again to me that bt need to train their cs staff better for a big company to treat people as though were just a pain in the backside is wrong when making statements like you can use multiple devices they should add but not all at the same time so we really know what sort of device were to follow,Bad
2661,virgin have left me with inlet boxes and so many cables connected to both inlets that i dont know which one is live and which one is not the mass of cables are connected to both its very confusing they have added cable additions to cables and have cables that go nowhere literally nowhere its a mess i requested this to be sorted and they want to charge me for a technician to sort out their own mess nobody would accept this amount of cables in one room so i find it insulting that they are expecting me to pay them to sort out their mess i would expect virgin to have left a tidy job in the first place,Bad
2662,lies about contract and wifi is atrocious,Bad
2663,this wifi is the biggest scam i have ever been involved the beginning they provide fantastic customer service with friendly explanations to get you hooked and signed up but this comes with constant harassment and pressure to sign up they seem especially qualified into pressuring first time home renters and buyers once signed up it takes forever to get through and then to be met with simply clueless employees who provide absolutely no help whatsoever we did not received wifi for weeks after our original start date with upcoming exams and other working from home commitments to adhere to we were simply left unsatisfactory and disregarded no matter how many times we rang to correct this issue it was simply a server issue which was being fixed in the back of fix evidently this was never actually fixed also beware of hidden charges even after cancellation i am being charged for router returns shipping costs apparent late fees when i have not even received any wifi and paid well over for the set up my phone cannot go a day without receiving a call from one of their customer services harassing me about why i left or why i must pay them more and more atrocious,Bad
2664,customer service is abysmal i have tried to speak with somebody five times today on two occasions by phone the line quality was atrocious and it was very difficult to hear what was being said to me when i queried this i was told the connection was to south africa this in itself is not a problem but the line quality does not speak well of a service provider on another two occasions i tried the online chat but was cut off before finishing my request to have a manager call me back was ignored i have been a loyal talktalk customer for over years,Bad
2665,terrible company payed off a contract in march but funnily enough im still getting forced to pay them now the contract ends in october even though ive paid it off but theyve now changed it to a later date,Bad
2666,since taking out a business tariff for years we have had no service the story is as follows contacted by sure telecom to upgrade our business tariff had with separate suppliers beforehand i agreed and they asked me to post a star review for free phone cases i agreed then everything started to go wrong i had to resign contracts times as they appeared to have errors obviously from new employees i accepted the nd change without complaint as sometimes things can go wrong on the rd call i queried and stated that i wanted to terminate weeks after our original contract was signed they offered to pay the extra month on my old network so i agreed again i now wish i hadnt if you think this is the end of the problems you would be incorrect i was then told that a new sim would be sent and i would need to go on to vodafone for a few days and then change back to as i wanted to keep my business number however only an sim was sent my old provider stopped working on the th i waited all day for the new sim to work this did not happen i called the next day they said they would sort something their end and it would be working by the next day this again did not happen another hour waiting for the phone to be answered to be told oh i thought we would wait for your post so my original plan would work this letter has still not arrived days after the phonecall it would definitely be working by the end of business on the friday did not work could not contact the company all weekend as closed monday came around i was again promised it would be working within hours at pm still not working tuesday morning at am called again left ringing for mins finally answered to be told i cannot terminate contract without a fee even though i have not recieved a service yet currently on the phone at pm for mins with no answer today is the consider whether you want to use a company that allows your company to lose money as people cannot contact you and impact the safety of your staff who need to work without a mobile phone in strangers houses potentially on their own,Bad
2667,totally useless if you want to contact them its only foreign call help centres also the list of security questions is ridiculous you should need to provide your email and a password not give all the details that could lead to a security breach i will be looking around when my contract end had they arent robust just endless i shouldnt have to be giving all those details to a stranger as stated my email and a password should suffice and once be more robust,Bad
2668,i phoned vm to end my broadband contract at the beginning of july and my router shortly after as went with another provider come august they sent me another bill for another month and when i phoned i was told the disconnection wasnt actioned that was rectified in the next few days however i have been waiting for the return packaging to send the hub back since the original phone call i stated clearly i couldnt hand it over to the courier as i work i have received numerous texts and emails to arrange the pick up phoned vm three more times to be told to wait for the packaging which hasnt arrived and now on top of that been told that they are charging me for not returning the equipment it is a bloody joke theres nothing that i want more than to get rid of the vm router but they are clearly making it impossible for me to return it i will not spend any more of my time trying to get through to customer service only to be told to wait for the packaging that nobody bothers to send out and i certainly refuse to pay any more bills,Bad

2678,the chat person did not solve my problem and did not give me time to get the information he needed,Bad
2679,their mobile coverage was terrible so we moved my wifes number over to o via pac and this somehow changed our contract the sim was only a free sim and doing this has somehow changed our contract and vm and they are now extending our service with them i cant leave fast enough that is if i can leave,Bad

2682,its incredibly difficult to get through to your customer service centre the price we are charged for band phone and tv package is astronomical in proportion to the service received internet connection is so poor its unbelievable we were charged for the top broadband package only to find from an engineer that it was not supported for our area,Bad
2683,they keep you repeating your issue over and over again i have spent hours talking to them and they just ask the same question over and over again they never fix it just keep you repeating the issue over and over never fix it just keep you repeating your issue over and over again,Bad

2687,i wish i could select no stars they dont even deserve star most terrible network and customer service never would recommend vodafone to anyone customer services team is not knowledgeable enough to resolve complaints and managers are always too busy to speak to customers i have been asked to travel miles in the middle of the night to know the exact postcode of the area where i had the poor network most recently,Bad
2688,one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to use i feel so sorry for the people sat in their customer service department theyre nice people but they have to deal with awful systems and opaque informationthis is the second time i have complained about their service this time because they annoyed me enough to leave them and search for an alternative the actual process of leaving took attempts then the final bill was sent to me revoked sent to me again revoked and then sent for a third time their systems do not talk to one another the left hand does not seem to know what the right hand is doing and they are only interested in trying to tick a box or sell you a service which is inappropriate for you if you have any other choice at all choose someone else for your broadband supply,Bad
2689,if it could be zero it ould be vm is fleecing me for over month i want to leave but i can not contact them on hold for hr no pick up hr wait on online chat they work on attrition they think you will give up dont touch them vm is toxic its got nothing to do with we have had it for over yrs if they can manage that now its no wonder they cant manage anything else avoid avoid avoid,Bad

2691,i made the mistake of subscribing to talk talk fibre broadband twice admittedly its my own stupid mistake thinking how could they give me the same problem as my first contract mistake my service was dropped engineers came and went problem resolved but broadband speed is nowhere near fibre crap max dont touch with a barge pole,Bad
2692,network outage again and hopeless customer service no one to talk to or offer help as the call wait times are in excess of mins using mobile data again and no clarity as to when the estimated resolution may happen as the virgin fault status pages has a fault th major outage this disgraceful for what is now a required utility l with vm being at a national level avoid and go with another to above finally got through to a remote call centre rep hung up and then called back and hung up when i answered reps will do this to cover the audit trail should i complain and cover their tracks that it was a communications problem customer end utterly hopeless,Bad
2693,its actually painful being a customer of ee i cant believe they have the audacity to run a communication business its like being experimented on to see how much bad service you can take im finally free after many years my new provider is actually a bit more expensive but i dont care ill happily pay more to escape ee,Bad
2694,deceitful and corrupt i wish i was with another provider,Bad
2695,the wifi keeps disconnecting and my teenagers need wifi to go on google classroom and google meet to do there work but this hunk of junk isnt working we called the company and all they said was maybe too many device are being used however they are on there laptops on word doc and on there phones to check there timetables and my husband works nights so he doesnt use his device much so how are there too many devices being used the lack of empathy from talk talk is being heavily highlighted this lockdown this a st word country and it is highlighted in the un law that it is against the law to deprive some one of wifi so how can talk talk the the money we pay a month be unable to stick to this rule and the contract we agreed to,Bad
2696,i recently contacted virgin media for assistance in setting up my multi room tv box as i had experienced problems when trying to set up my second box after using the online chat service i was then connected to an operator to help solve the problem i explained to the operator that i had an error code of s which would suggest a coax cable problem after an hour and a few minutes i had to end the call through sheer frustration of being repeatedly asked to confirm the error code id estimate about times i was asked to confirm the code which the operator told me didnt exist i am still no further forward my multi room is not working,Bad
2697,having had a business account with ee for approx years the signal and service has gotten even worse ive tried to speak to customer services but now being made to work for them to providing evidence of poor signal and calls in different locations im self employed who pays for this i absolutely would not recommend to the ee response ive provided evidence and countless phone calls im self employed who is paying my wages for doing your technicians job it should not be the customers job to roam around the countryside finding your faults,Bad

2712,i mean where do i start initial broadband installation promise has been broken twice no calls from them but a text message to say they will call more than minutes to just send you to cancellation department compared to less than seconds if you want to be new would be foolish after all the signs still sign up with them hey talk talk thanks for showing how poor your service is at this very early stage i am saved coz i am not signing up with you for your broadband,Bad
2713,hackers stole my account and were no help whatsoever in recovering it in fact they wouldnt even talk to me about it and i never got it back,Bad
2714,by far the worst provider ive ever dealt with on nd of april ordered iphone pro max and apple watch ultra the iphone a fault within the first week was told to return it was also told a pre paid returns pack would be sent went to the post office and ended up having to pay to return the phone at my expense they never even paid for the return postage they had the phone back days today i received a message saying its been scanned back at the warehouse and my line has been reverted back to what it was previous sim only gb so i thought great i can order the new samsung s ultra and get it delivered for tomorrow works out well as im on day off from work and i can take delivery not as simple as that spent hour on live chat this morning upgrading was told they had a few issues but managed to push the upgrade through and waived the up front costs for me to good to be true hours later no emails with confirmation i get back on chat and been told the system reversed my upgrade and i have to wait another days for the system to catch up so i can upgrade annoys me with this company they have proper took the pss with the cost of living price increases same tariff and phone was a month last month checked it again today and its gone up to a month same with the iphone full works plan gone from in weeks now to this company is a fine example of a rip off you look at price comparison websites and there is a massive saving compared to ee prices it the service are useless and clearly overseas employed now i have to wait again to upgrade the upgrade process is a pain in the channel returns takes days for them to reply returns bag is posted to you a further to pack is posted at your expense another in the warehouse for days text received to upgrade but you cant actually upgrade because the system is that slow it takes hours to catch up with after sending a message to its experience,Bad
2715,do not recommend to anyone who wants to have good internet and quality conversation with customer service getting worse and worse with every day impossible to have conversation with customer service team they are like death people dont want to listed to what customer says doesnt want to let go people pestering with further offers when i am clearly saying i want to leave also doesnt record anything on your account i gave over days notice of leaving but they seem to skip this part of my messages also breaching the contract and customer rights charging you more at the end of the contract even though it is black on white written when the deal is ending creating extra costs but their service is poor internet is disconnecting every evening poor service useless customer service incompetent employers pestering people with offers that they dont need live chat is closed so you have to message through whatsapp it keeps disconnecting so they keep asking you again and again same security questions it is impossible to have conversation from start to the end this is too much stress,Bad
2716,absolute disaster do not sign up for them have tried on several occasions to call customer service have spent a total of hours being on hold and still no response i am having problems with my broadband absolutely terrible customer service,Bad
2717,i actually feel quite embarrassed for vodafone their call centres are based in india and the customer service team as much as they do try dont have the required level of english to be able to assist you properly vodafone make simple things like setting up an online account really difficult eg you have a mobile wifi device but you need to receive a text to register and obviously your mobile wifi device cannot receive texts but at the same time they wont let you use a number to register every time i take out a product with vodafone i have to spend about a week on the phone to them speaking to multiple people until eventually someone solves my query or i just give up altogether for example i topped up for gb on internet for some reason this needs to be added gb at a time and i need to call them each time this runs out however no one has managed to explain why this is and its a huge waste of my time when i thought i was buying a sim with gb on it already which is what was i also applied for fibre optic broadband and entered my postcode to see if it was available in my area weeks later and days before they were due to send an engineer out they call to tell me its not available in my area and theres nothing they can offer to compensate me as i am only a pay and go mobile wifi customer they are also really strict and wont let me convert my pay and go mobile wifi into a pay monthly account as youre only allowed to have one vodafone product at anyone time i mean ive just been approved for a mortgage and credit card elsewhere so its their loss and not mine after all these issues i think i had a lucky i contacted them on facebook and they state they try to reply within minutes they completely ignored my message which to be honest didnt surprise me one bit in future if i need a mobile wifi device i would rather buy a new device from a completely different company than top up my vodafone device my time is worth more than this,Bad
2718,i have to honestly say this company is evil and puts money before any care or concern for its users i joined talktalk about a year ago they were cheap but i knew their systems were good but customer service mum has dementia she lives nearby we try to keep her independent and that involves me visiting her every day and phoning her times a day to make sure she takes vital medication so the phone is absolutely vital also the internet is useful for me or any carers for information etc mum can only rarely use the phone to dial out and thats becoming less so it is also vital for her fall detector so i call her about times a day to remind her to take her pills and ensure shes oki decided to change her isp to the same as mine talktalk to save money it was all set up and i just had to follow a link to enable my account however the logon page would not accept my username the one they gave me so i was unable to the account and get a password i was totally unable to get this fixed by their automated systems and could not actually talk to a real person i realised i had made a big mistake moving to talktalk and risking mums communications with them i was unable to phone my mum as the line was dead so i came to the conclusion that to cancel the contract was my best option there is supposed to be a day cooling off period three days later i got to their disconnection people but they kept saying that i did not pass their security check so nothing could be done nothing i could say could convince them i tried times with of their staff the last one said she would check and call back she didnt by this time mums phone wasnt working at all i could not dial in to her and even if mum could manage it outgoing calls werent possible i told talktalk about this and the danger it posed to my mum and miraculously outgoing calls were enabled so her and fall detector worked but not much help as mum wasnt able to dial out by this time i was getting desperate talktalk would not let me cancel due to the apparent issue with security which by the way i believe is their error by them getting my account details mixed up with mums mum is still unable to call out i tried many different avenues with talktalk even their facebook page i kept telling them my mum is at risk as i cant phone her but they didnt only way i can get round this is to change both my and mums isp to which will take a week or two and cost me money as i beak my contract talktalk have now taken over mums line as when i call i get a message only authorised calls can connect to this line thats because mums call blocker is now receiving all numbers as withheld as talktalk are not forwarding callers numbers i have now remotely configured the to accept a code when i call now but it wont be enabled until know about my mum and the risk involved common sense would tell them the security problem is down to them and by not allowing me to cancel the contract they risk and confuse a lady with dementia they are heartless ive given up talking directly to them but there are other options i can take but it takes time i have copies of all texts and recordings of all phone calls and will be taking legal advice please dont use these people you ever know when your comms becomes vital th march talktalk have requested more information which i have supplied but its not as simple as that this morning i contacted talktalk again trying to cancel the account this time i passed security but when i was connected to cancellations it all went wrong as i keep telling them i have an acount with talktalk and i set one up for mum which i want to close but both accounts are paid by my bank account so they see me as the account holder for both accounts they kept telling me to wait minutes and that it will take a while i kept telling them i cant stay on the phone any longer as i have a dementia sufferer to attend to so i had to hang up after nearly an hour it being completed just to clarify talktalk the information i gave you today was my email address reference number is the account number to be terminated my name not the user and the phone number for the account to be closed you didnt specify if you wanted my details or hers so please please work it out talk to me and let us goth marchi recieved a call from talktalk which unfortunatly i missed i believe the guy said his name was andy and he mentioned welfare and asked me to call him back but the line was so bad i didnt get the number i tried calling the number logged on my phone and recieved a message saying someone from talktalk had called me and they would try again later im adding this to my review as it seems the only way i can contact them caring for someone with dementia leaves me with little time,Bad
2719,there was an article yesterday in the bbc about virgin media and the right i have to escalate my complaint to an independent ombudsman well i have got to the point that i cant deal with virgin media is just getting ridiculous how long does it take to fix your broadband issues honestly the broadband is completely useless with so many intermittent connectivity issues and issues that have been going on for months now this level of poor service is not acceptable and forget about compensation the level of compensation you will offer wont be enough for the hours lost for the work i am not able to do from home for the poor service you service is the same we are working hard to fix this issues i am not sure if you are working hard but for sure you are not working efficiently enough to get this fixed,Bad

2728,date of experience march,Bad
2729,i felt like i was connected to a bot not a human as i was just fed back standard text responses they had not listened to what teh fault was and just kept asking me the same question over and over is either a very inexperienced person on the online chat or a computer i wasted mins and was told to disconnect the g hotspot which obviously would have resulted in the chat connection to talk talks also failed to answer a single question i asked a total waste of time avoid,Bad

2731,ive been a customer for years and if i could cancel i would problem is they cant get anything done in the call centre or answer a call i spent hours on the phone this week trying to order a handset upgrade which they cancelled the order for twice because the person put it through the system incorrectly days wasted waiting for a delivery and their compensation offer was then when it arrived they put me on a more expensive tariff than agreed with less included in it stay well clear because if you ever have an issue the hassle of having to deal with vodafone simply isnt worth it,Bad
2732,i bought a business in december and decided to move the business phone line from talk talk to bt as i thought this would be the option i called bt and what seemed to be an extremely helpful sales person offered me the perfect package that ticked every box i explained that we were moving premises and he told me that as we were moving the line back to bt all my install was free of charge and everything could be up and running within weeks i expected to hear from someone within hours with my install date at the new premises days later i rang them and found out the sales guy had completely me the service had to be like for like which meant my line was staying where it was also the pricing package was completely wrong this is where everything started going wrong from pricing nearly doubling without telling me sales team promised to ring but never did and just set up the new service with no discussion installation dates being moved because they couldnt find the premises and the contact number was completely wrong when engineers finally show up they lie about being unable to install as theyre too lazy to do the actual work billing me for things i havent its been an extremely difficult journey to get my business up and running and months on im still having issues with my bill lots of over promising and massively under delivering the biggest issue throughout the whole process has been the communication within bt their crm system is nonexistent and ive had to repeatedly explain the situation as they cant find the notes everytime i call logic tells me they should have number per customer which means all notes will be in place but they dont so far ive had about account numbers and reference numbers this i think is bts biggest problem as it means youre constantly faced with the bt shunt the problem is always passed back to the previous person you spoke to in the hope they have a clue about the problem and they never call back so youre constantly chasing them if you have an alternative provider available in your area i highly recommend it using bt is anything but smooth and for business this is vital,Bad

2738,i was a virgin media customer for about years after many over priced bills and incorrect direct debit i decided enough was enough i called to ask how long before my contract was up the first lady i spoke to informed me i would have to pay a further after my disconnection and failure to do so would lead to debt collectors and what not feeling slightly baffled a few days later i decided to call again to confirm this this time the lady i spoke to told me that no i would not have to pay this and in fact virgin would end up owing me money because their bills are paid a month in advance so i call to give my days notice and the call is answered by a rough speaking guy who sounds like hes on cigarettes a day i tell him i want to give my notice and the proceeds to try and tempt me into staying offering me bills that are less but im having non of it and he dislikes this he becomes increasingly rude and sharp with me he then tells me i cannot give my notice until i pay different amount to this i inform his that the lady previous assured me i wouldnt need to pay anything seen as i was disconnecting on the day my contract ends he insists she was wrong refuses to give me his name and then puts the phone down on me eventually i got my own way and they agreed to disconnect me and informed me that the polite a day guy was in fact wrong and i owed them no money at all today is disconnect day and i am pleased to be rid of them there are many freeview boxes now that offer all that do without the enormous monthly bills and rude staff,Bad

2743,avoid them in all circumstances they are terrible and lucky that our installation was delayed and only then we got to know how bad their customer service was it took five minutes to sell a service and place an order for virgin but when i intended to cancel my service i had to call them more than times as their lines are so bad that they drop as soon as somebody answers after minutes of waiting and they kept transferring me to other departments on top of this the o sim sold was not cancelled and i had to ring o a few times to cancel that it was never my responsibility to do that but i had to do it otherwise it is my money and my credit rating that will be impacted all in all it took more than hours of phone calls to cancel my order with virgin media and media what privilege do you have that gives you to make your customers wait for hours to full fill a service disappointing and most inefficient service i had ever seen from a service avoid them as their customer service calls will end up in philippines or india or somewhere where they do no have any context of the issues and they would even call their customers fickle excel and grow by providing outstanding customer service and virgin are in such sad place that they do not even know what empathy means,Bad

2748,what the heck is up with this dishonest ramshackle outfit say they are going to do things make appointments and then just blow it off with zero communication of any so bad that i actually think they are straight up lying to the customer rather than being incompetent because this is im out here in the sticks trying to run an internet biz with my late afternoon download speed at k yes thats k not m previous homeowner did not warn me of course i called managed to navigate through the maze of options designed to make you throw your phone at the wall in exasperation and finally reached a person ran checks said your connection is dropping out over times per day and i said yes i know and they said hang tight we will fix it a few days later a text appeared saying they fixed it nope nothing had been is an error but this scenario happened multiple times over several months the same line test the same we fixed it the same nothing never fixed concluded what else could i conclude logically they were straight up lying because they didnt have any financial incentive to fix old lines when fibre was going in at some point never mind the fact that its a service people are paying after months of persistence i gave up on getting dsl that worked and got satellite internet which was expensive garbage and then a g router with stupid little aerials on my roof fast forward to december discovered fibre is now available applied via who set the appointment actually showed up the first time they came out on jan th put a box on my wall and said we need to close the road to run the wire across will be back in a few days to finish it just hang weeks later still crickets zero communication i called again who said yes this is typical of they normally have to have us reschedule otherwise they just wont do it colour me voda rescheduled it for the th of marchand guess what simply didnt show up no communication of any kind just blew it you starting to see a pattern herei sure am and i am going to say it i think has an actual deliberate policy of lying to the customer they dont want to do the difficult jobs because i am guessing they are paid a fixed rate per contract and they know that if they blow off the customer enough times they will give up they do not give a rats about you or me or anyone same as any other monopolistic outfit im calling you out for your persistent dishonesty and persistent track record of total failure to address the chronic faulty service in my area i hope some alternate provider puts you out of business asap you suck to a level beyond what can be put into internet business has all but run into the ground since i have been living here if i had a dollar for every time i have screamed at the broken internet i wouldnt need a business id be on an i dont think the problem here is with the actual engineers from what i can tell they are hard working competent and skilled my suspicion is that this is deliberate being done at a management level to an extent that is abusive to the customer some genius realized they could save the company money by simply not providing the service and others play along people have an actual line check done before you buy a house surveyor did not test the internet,Bad
2749,my broadband goes down intermittently i had an engineer out and he was here for five minutes reset the router and said the problem was solved yet a week later it was back to the service going down sporadically i contacted virgin media through their live chat and one of their service agents aman said he was going to book a technician to contact me on the th of june as well as refund me for loss of service and for the fact my virgin landline has never worked i never received any contact on the th and my bill hasnt shown any like many over the past year and a half have been working from home more often having an unreliable network makes my job a lot harder first year i had virgin i couldnt recommended them highly enough but the last years their service has just gotten to the point that next time my contact is up for renewal im switching to someone else because they cant be as bad,Bad

2759,so i decided to cancel my contract with vodafone as id reached the end of the agreement and wanted a cheaper rolling monthly deal the cancellation process was rather simple and vodafone rolled over and admitted defeat when i told them about smarty mobiles rolling monthly contract however they failed to tell me that my phone was locked to their network so after i transferred my number to smarty mobile i got locked out of my phone i called vodafone and the robot told me to do it online so i did but after completing the form i was redirected to the home page i called again and they advised me that the only way to unlock was through the website and that it probably worked but i had to wait hours hours have past and still no verification so i called again to check this time the robot put me through to another robot that told me that they were unable to connect me with an agent regarding phone unlocks so hear i am with a phone that can only use wifi and a sim that locks out my phone excellent work vodafone you really are the of the network providers,Bad
2760,what can all of us do about this appalling service from here is a of the third complaint ive sent to them over loss of tv and broadband service since feb th incredible lack of customer care hopping boiling mad frustrated and truly disappointed with customer service it is now more than hours since i was promised a call from a manager the promise was made during a conversation on thursday april th with ms ashen she said i would definitely receive a call from someone in authority within hours to sort things out like dozens of others in my area i have been without broadband and tv service since february th due apparently to a cut cable i work from home i rely heavily on the internet to do my work this prolonged lack of service has cost me a fortune from to pounds a day buying coffees to sit in cafes and pubs and access their internet the quality of my work has suffered and so has my sanity these are noisy places and it has been impossible to do as much as i normally do i had one conversation on march nd with a customer service manager named scott he offered to cancel my monthly bill and give me pounds for my expenses from february th through march nd i suggested we establish a more realistic figure when the problem was fixed presuming then that that would be soon and my internet and tv service was restored i also said that was well short of the mark then and as you can imagine it is now truly paltry it has been days since your service went down thats at least pounds that i have been forced to spend due to your breach of service when can i expect recompense ms ashen informed me that my complaint was placed in some internal file you have called deadlock this unilateral action appears to have relegated it to some dead zone where nothing then happens i have heard from no one since speaking with scott on the nd of march it was me who called again and after much delay and faffing around i was put through to ms ashen and i have just logged in and now see that the fix date has now jumped to may th no call back as promised no explanation of what is happening no remedial solution offered this is the worst customer service treatment i have ever experienced and to add insult to injury your billing department is still spitting out emails as is your annoying marketing juggernaut i am now going to do three things cancel my direct debit to you and seek another internet service provider contact radio s you and yours and get them to do a story on this shoddy display of customer disservice contact ofcom and make a detailed complaint clearly your customer service protocols need an urgent overhaul i have always had a lot of respect for the company richard branson built no more all ive experienced is bungling and broken promises and a distasteful lack of basic effort to temporarily provide your customers with alternative internet service i expect my expenses to be covered by virgin you have taken a payment from my account for the month of march even though you provided no service and thus were in breach of contract i expect this to be paid back to me as well and i have cancelled my direct debit with you appalling on all fronts virgin,Bad
2761,i was calling to customer service last few days but no replay also i send email but no replyi need my pac code read one of the forum is closing down so no customer care,Bad

2772,i would give this review zero stars if i could being on hold for minutes before anyone answers the phone then being connected to different people all of which then put you on hold our phone line was repaired but then broke again within a half hour of the engineer leaving when i tried to explain this my online account told me that i was happy with the service tried to call again today and waiting for another minutes to talk to someone shockingly bad,Bad
2773,ordered a new line appointment booked and subsequently confirmed by their customer service team in india repeated texts to me to remind me that i should be in from am pm on the relevant day including a text on the day before finally the day arrives i had booked annual leave pm comes and goes no engineer i decide to call up once i navigate the ridiculous labyrinth of dial if dial if i eventually get an automated system telling me that the appointment has been cancelled so i initiate a further call to customer services still no call from bt yet they say the engineer cancelled the installation because there were issues with the network installation and blames it on the fact that my house is a my observations installation to a property cannot be counted as an exceptional circumstance for a massive company like bt this problem could have been anticipated by making a few simple routine checks prior to the automated booking so that it never went ahead in the first place i had to call up to receive an apology which was delivered by a computer i had to call up again to find out what exactly was going on i have lost a significant amount of money and time chasing around after bt yet again,Bad
2774,talktalk broadband is horrific slow laggy and provided router is good if you are no further than meters from it i wanted to upgrade speed of my broadband i spent over an hour on the chat with agent who was not able to do anything he was offering me some silly options like months contract as a solution my contact ends in july i cant wait to leave them,Bad
2775,sadly a zero stars option not available been waiting for a new landline for over months and still waiting they need to the replaced as an alleged telco infrastructure provided utterly non existent service delivery and non existent customer they do not care about their reputation or customers they are great at absolutely nothing oh except for appointing new directors and managers and internally and getting nice fat cheques shocking organisation,Bad
2776,shame this company wanted to cancel did did not and they made me pay more month small not chose these company please,Bad
2777,i had a call last week from bt trying to sell me something however while they were on i told them i did not think that the volume on my digital handset provided by bt was working very well the sales person told me to do some things and it started working but she suggested i take a new phone at no cost to me and i initially agreed however over the next couple of days i decided that my old phone was working fine and did not need a new one i received conf of this from bt on the th and then again on the th july i then received another bt email telling me the switchover to the new phone would take place on july and the old handset would cease working i called to cancel the new product and indeed the member of staff made no indication that this would not be possible neither did the person on the th july and neither did the preceeding emails before the th and indeed when i complained about this i was told by the person who initially talked me into taking this new phone the hours notice was required for cancellations which from time of order to receipt did not give me that option as i was getting nowhere with the incompetent staff who initially was shirley who sent the new handset then on th to ellie who from the same department cancelled the order telling me she would send out the returns bag for the new handset again no mention that i could not cancel or needed hours notice then on the th my existing handset went dead so became really annoyed waiting over minutes for bt to answer my call and when they did it was with a really rude guy who cut me off before giving me his name had to recall and wait another minutes for an answer and this time was put through to shirley who was the person who persuaded me to take the new handset and she then advised hours notice is required to deal with my issue ie to get my existing handset reinstated asked her why she never advised that once the order was placed it would be impossible to cancel she avoided answering that only to ask why i wanted to cancel which was irrelevant i then demanded the ceos name and email address all she could provide was his name said there was no email address which i found after ending the call by google so a very lengthy email to the ceo philip jansen who has not bothered to acknowledge my issue i mean why bother with a customer who has been loyal to bt for years one of his minions called kirsty wilson has been in touch saying it is not possible to reconnect my existing handset no explanation as to why this is and also received an automated message to say the same thing again no explanation as to why this is and finishing with bt has been unable to resolve the situation so bt are now calling the situation due to them not resolving it deadlock and i can now refer this to the ombudsman quoting the magic bt get out word is a bt business account and my business has been without a landline since july and as this service is the cloud my wifi and internet is also not working properly as they are all linked i pay around a month to bt and ee same company for my business service which i am currently not receiving anyone else experienced anything like this not only will i be going to the ombudsman but i will also take it to the national papers,Bad
2778,internet is intermittent alllll the time long waits for customer service do all the updates and still no joy i hate this broadband,Bad

2781,in the past few months i have had to cancel and also open a new account with virgin media not due to anything they did wrong just due to changes in my personal circumstances and both experiences were absolute nightmares when cancelling my account i phoned the company times where i was put on hold for an hour each time and then hung up on by virgin i then tweeted them to find out how on earth i was supposed to cancel my account as you cannot cancel online only via phoning them up and i couldnt get through to which they responded that i should phone up when the call centres opened at am which i did and then got through to an agent where i eventually managed to process my opening a new account for a new house under my housemates name virgin sent her a agreement but never actually activated our account and never provided us with the account number after a month of not hearing anything from them a month after our wifi hub was supposed to be delivered i phoned them up and was told by the woman on the phone that virgin had no record of us signing up for a wifi contract with them and to wait a few days to see if our wifi hub was delivered after a month of waiting already which i knew was rubbish so i phoned up again and was eventually put through to a woman who barely spoke any english at all which im not usually bothered about but they should at least be able to understand you who eventually sorted out my issue and we were issued with an account number and were finally able to log in to my virgin media and manage our account from there i should not have to fight with a company for them to take my money diabolical service and if anybody is ever cheaper than virgin for the next houses i live in i will always choose other companies over them,Bad
2782,i was chatting to wendy and before i agreed the new contract i was cut off now your systems are down so what happens now will she ring me back because she was waiting my reply,Bad
2783,sometimes when i have been on hold for some length of time listening to geronimo for the time i like to imagine that head of customer service is playing some form of elaborate practical joke on their customers or perhaps participating in a bet to see how badly one can treat ones customers and stay in a one seems to know how to do anything useful like change a billing address or if they do then they change it to the wrong address or link your account to someone else who used to live at that address or cancel your direct debit or some other ridiculous mistake i feel sorry for the people working in the call centres because i suspect it is not due to lack of willingness on their part rather an archaic and not fit for purpose crm software package regardless of why i couldnt deal with the uselessness any longer and finally managed to leave calls service this bad can not be down to incompetence alone my guess is a cynical ploy to destroy british morale,Bad
2784,had and tv since christmas it has never worked right tv keeps going pixelated had to do a course on line only to have the signal keep breaking up so all in all not very happy with your service,Bad
2785,absolutely disgusting company avoid customer care what customer care they tell you one thing and on the next call have to do a call listening to make sure that was said as the staff are incapable of putting what they said they would into the notes i am excited for when i no longer have a contract with this disgusting company i will tell my friends not go anywhere near vodafone already got one friend to move to o do not get any product from vodafone,Bad
2786,ive been a customer for over years and weve had some rows and at times i had to cancel my dd to get things sorted but right now i have a problem with my phone and they have no email address but they have the usual faqs that answer website is designed to send the user around in circles until you give up so i called them as soon as the chap to whom i spoke realized i didnt want a new phone he wasnt interested and asked security questions i couldnt answer there and could have asked other questions that would have proved who i am but he really wasnt interested ill now be calling the phone maker as maybe i should have been on a sim only deal for years and im happy with that im a very light user most internet stuff is done via wifi but now i think ill ask around my friends and see who they use and if theyre helpful when problem nowadays is the number of choices is smaller many are piggy backed on ee,Bad

2793,i have had a contract with tescos for years and up y til this year i was satisfied with them one month ago i went online and paid an early upgrade fee to change my tariff and get a upgrade on my phone for some reason i ordered the wrong phone i ordered and iphone pro instead of the pro max i instantly rang tescos minutes after receiving it and launched a cancellation with them they arranged for dpd to collect the phone days later and stated that once the phone had been received the upgrade would get cancelled and i could upgrade to the phone i wanted nobody contacted me and it took me to ring and check my tracking to see that the phone had been received by the warehouse i then had to ring again to see why my upgrade hasnt been cancelled i was told that the phone had to await grading but the cooling off period would be frozen and i would still be able to upgrade once the phone had been graded after waiting a further week i had to ring tescos mobile again i was told that i could not upgrade for another month as i had already attempted to upgrade and that my early upgrade payment couldnt be refunded even tho i actually had no upgrade now on file i filed a complaint and was due to have a phone call with someone answering my complaint i am still waiting for that call i waited a further week and half to attempt a new upgrade and on the date that i was told i could upgrade on numerous occasions i clicked on my app to see that my contact tariff had changed and i was in fact paying for the contract that i had cancelled and being charged for a phone that i did not have again i had to call tescos mobile to get the issue resolved i was told that it couldnt be dealt with straight away and that it would need to be escalated to a manager to resolve this issue once it was resolved then i would need to wait another month until i could attempt an upgrade again after being told on several occasions that i could upgrade once the cancellation was complete and now being told that i couldnt and was being charged for a phone that i sent back weeks ago i requested to speak to a manger i was on hold for roughly minutes to be told that there didnt appear to b a manger in but they would log the call and i should hear from a manager in hrs that the contract could also not be cancelled until a manager responded so i am now in a contract for a phone that i dont have and have not had in my hands for longer than minutes im out of pocket as ive paid an early upgrade fee for something that i havent received i now have to wait for someone to ring me back to then hopefully cancel my contract and answer my complaint i am so disappointed with the customer service that i have received especially after being a customer for years i intend to go to the ombudsman with my complaint as tescos so not appear to care in the slightest and i refuse to pay for a phone that i do not own,Bad
2794,talktalk have a habit of adding services to your bill regardless of whether you want them or not once they have done this its impossible to remove the excess charges their website is hopeless live chat doesnt work and dont even think of trying to contact them by phone please whatever you do dont enter into a contract with them,Bad
2795,if i could give stars i ever do i have an constant internet connection which when working from home the last months is an absolute joke i pay a month for nothing the only reason i stay with you is because i have no choice in the matter as no one else is able to provide me with internet connection,Bad

2799,terrible internet speeds i should have over mbs but people cant video call at the same time without experiencing major bandwidth issues avoid at all cost,Bad
2800,utterly poor customer service the fact that they couldnt set up our direct debit properly twice and they thought they can just cut off our internet just because of something that they wasnt capable of doing in the first place is completely nonsense phoned their customer service up to understand what was going on and had to speak to different members of staff just to demand for a clear explanation was annoyed at the fact that most of them had poor english which should have been the number one rule for hiring someone to deal with customer servicing was absolutely atrocious not only was their service is poor the broadband is also slow i cannot wait for this years contract to be over to get rid of this terrible internet provider for a company to have just star reviews on average pretty much summarises it up,Bad
2801,worst experience ever spent over hours trying to pay off my old account for them to tell me i have to go store and when i go store there is nothing they can do instore so i have to ring customer service do that once again for them to keep telling me store has to do it nothing but passing me between people i want to pay it and leave as there plans are expensive compared to competitors and its a rubbish network were you always have issues with the network,Bad

2804,very expensive service compared to competitors and poor quality broadband which constantly drops in and out,Bad
2805,the online chat is clearly a joke they are obviously trying to hold a conversation with a number of people at the same time so use stalling tactics when you do get through they are useless and tell you to phone up no wonder they have the highest number of customer complaints ref bbc watchdog oct,Bad
2806,rubbish had a cheap sim only deal via the mse website i switched bank accounts a few months in which meant changing my payment card this apparently cancelled the cheap deal i was on and wouldnt change it back i was therefore forced to via the at the going rate the second time i did this my account was debited but i didnt receive any credit so i had to buy more arent instant customer service reps struggle to understand anything at all the contact us links etc on the website are frequently unavailable along with your own account information i also found gg internet access really poor in most areas ive requested a pac so i can return to my old historically trouble free provider that i foolishly left tempted by a cheap deal that didnt turn out to be cheap or any good at alli would also like to point out that challenge every negative review posted on trustpilot trustpilot then ask the reviewer for evidence to back up their negative review or it will be deleted the response from to negative reviews is clearly some copy paste pr nonsense because they will grasp absolutely nothing and resolve absolutely nothing i am still waiting to be refunded for the i purchased but never study the names spelling and grammar used to write some of the positive reviews am i being too cynical,Bad
2807,new customer to so wish i could have stayed with ee more competent in my experience i even lost my european roaming due to starting a new contract which will add minimum to my annual helpline told me i could migrate my contract to one with roaming after mins on the poor chat service i discovered i could not even though that had been my clear first questionthe chat service asks you for your details even when its closed then it tells you its closed but not what time its open when you go to faqs it wont let you read them but sends you back to the closed chat servicei checked before leaving uk and was clearly informed roaming is switched on yet i cannot call or sms the uk all numbers an overhaul with the help of text accounts there was a quick reply on trust pilot acknowledging my disappointment but not actually addressing any of the points most of which were implicit suggestions to improve service and look more have since worked out why i couldnt call the uk it was because i had a block in international calls from the uk so vodafone barring is unable to distinguish a call to vs from the uk which seems like a pretty basic error if the trust pilot response had suggested this as a solution i would have been impressed and changed my review,Bad
2808,phoned ee to report someone using our address for their mobile phone and receiving letters from ee for them told them the persons address as we know the person but they have never lived with us and ee refused to amend the details and to us its not fraudulent to use our address for their credit i beg to next they can use my name an date of birth all your letters will be returned from now on stop sending me the letters you thieves,Bad
2809,i would give stars if i could i have been using virgin media for as long as i can remember when my husband died in november myself and my one year old daughter moved in with my parents and no longer were using the service in the immediate aftermath of james death i didnt do anything about the account and i hadnt formally moved out of my property however in march when they called to ask if i would renew my contract and offer me deals i explained the situation and that right now i did not require their services but that i would use them when i move into my future property they were understanding and transferred me to the cancellation team i went through the whole process again explaining the situation and as far as i was concerned i had cancelled and i cancelled my direct debit then in april i received a phone call asking if they could offer me new deals i explained that i had cancelled the account and was surprised to hear that they could see i had tried to cancel and that i wanted to but that it hadnt gone through again i got transferred to the cancellation team only for the line to go dead they have started sending me action warning emails and the bill has racked up to this has been going on for months now and i have had over of these conversations now with one of the conversations ending with me sobbing down the line because i had to repeat that my husband had died of glioblastoma brain cancer to over three people after being transferred from department to department today i have agreed to pay to get this over and done with and i am worried my credit rating will be affected they happily took the payment but have transferred me to the disconnection department and i have been on the line for over minutes i would always have recommended virgin media but i will never ever use them again in what has been the hardest time of my life they have added bucket loads of stress and i am so hurt by there customer service,Bad
2810,shocking customer service i placed an order in may this year for broadband and phone service from them and also was offered a google nest with my order i have still not got the google nest and after calling them over and over and talking to them on there web chat service i have still not got it and customer service seems to be no help at all my advice to anyone thinking of ordering there service is stay well away there customer service is just a total joke there happy to take your order and your money and as soon as that is done no one at virgin media wishes to help you at all just fob you off tell you you will get a call back and nothing at all from them stay away,Bad
2811,the online chat agent suggested that i contact the call centre instead to obtain pdf copies of of last years mobile bills for my accountant years of bills in line with tax accounting regulations should be available online for customers to easily download themselves i dont understand why couldnt email them to me instead of me having to subsequently call the customer service centre to request these arent the online chat agents actually part of the customer service was after suggested i pay an additional gbp per bill for paper each bill is only times that amount to add insult to injury randomly sent me an advert for using the online myaccount services to access previous bills and update my personal details etc the shortfall of which had led me to contact the online chat agent in the first shocking customer service,Bad
2812,all talk talk customer service is absolute has taken minutes to get a refund of a credit which should have been done automatically or seconds with a phone call to a british based call center,Bad
2813,i have always been a virgin media internet user but moved streets down from where i lived and unfortunately they did not offer their services even being on a high street location so i decided to go with talktalk to make it very short it is not worth the money the speed that was suggested that i would get is mb and guaranteed speed on the contract was mb i was far off from the promised figure my speed was mb most of the time and recently it went down to mb wow was i shocked its still possible to get results like that in anyway after all the time spend on online chats to do testing router change etc i have decided that i will not continue with talktalk and decided rather not have any internet at home than pay for something that does not work it felt like i would open my window every month and throw out,Bad
2814,ee mislead you into a contract and refuse to correct their mistake do not take out their annual upgrade plan as they will tell you that you can either keep the phone and upgrade to a new one or they will tell you that you can come off your year contract with the newly upgraded phone after one year both incorrect,Bad

2817,rubbish company very high price and bad service please go for community fibre,Bad
2818,im on my mobile phone listening to the awful bt music and worse still its distorted though my phones speaker so it sounds like the music is playing under water beneath crashing waves its the kind of noise that would warble out of a system in hell to torture the souls of the damned id call bt on the landline but the landlines reception is worse still and anyway the allegedly landline which crackles and fades to the point the callers voice becomes inaudible and has done so for decades is another bt saga no this story today is about my home hub delivery that bt repeatedly dispatches to the wrong this week ive only notched up three hours of conversation with bt call centre staff with wobbly wait music and thats relatively low time wasting while predictably yet another employee in bt up again and so it goes on and on i swear i do try to be respectful and polite to them you see my problem is that bt cant send a home hub to my correct home address despite my paying them per month for the service six weeks after placing my order im still making phone calls and repeating my delivery details to different to the current call the music has finished and im now repeating my postcode to yet another bt guy who pretends he suffers from chronic dyslexia as once again he asks me for my delivery details this is the time today hes done this dear readers at this point some of you must be wondering do i perhaps have a speech impediment i assure you that i do could it be that my house is difficult to find nope amazon deliver here as do royal mail regularly and they have zero problem in comprehending where i live proving you dont need a brain like alan to decrypt my location from my delivery details this is agony the bt call centre worker is now pretending to be a complete idiot he must be because for the sixth time during our conversation hes asked me for my home address and postcode and when i to see if hes entered it correctly he keeps getting it heres the thing these call centre workers cant be this stupid and i have gradually come to believe over hours of conversations with many different seemingly incompetent clueless bt workers that they are in fact bored and they are taking out their workplace frustration on their it could be that bt staff are rather cunning and its an attempt to drive me to utter exasperation so what do they expect me to do maybe that i drive the mile round trip to the wrong delivery address and retrieve my home hub along with all the rest of the hubs they claim to have sent there perhaps i will kindly take these other misdirected home hubs to the nearest post office and post them back to bt well im not doing the reason heres a curious bt rule ask bt call centre workers to perform a simple task like correct a wrong delivery address and their staff will invariably do the opposite of what you request this apparent problem with simple comprehension and retention of information could be organizational and systemic and if its not a cunning strategy then i suggest that it has it origins partly in human nature which experiences working for bt as soul crushing call centre boredom and partly in how bt as an organization and their call centre staff because as i wrote human beings individually cant be this stupid because otherwise they would require support and care workers to help manage their daily a precious hour writing this nope good practice for the full and edited msm article it please do ignore this john bots replies its all if i contact bt on his advice ill be chatting to maybe three more people again for another hour none of whom will be able to correctly take down my address details why should i waste yet another precious hour even attempting to get any sense out of them oh and many thanks for the direct links to your helping colleagues on facebook and twitter john of course the facebook link just takes me to the generic bt page and id have to spend hours searching for the right person good laugh for you guys but then ive come to imagine one section of hell is probably a giant pointless call centre just like bt and one consolation im not the one trapped inside days later despite hours on the phone to bt call centre staff and numerous promises from them did the home hub ever arrive at my address of course it didnt i didnt expect it to soon its going to be months and no service,Bad
2819,i have been a talk talk customer for over ten years i have discovered i have been paying for over a year just for broadband and they are offering me a deal that is more expensive than other providers with no money returned for being over charged i find their behaviour disgraceful,Bad

2828,why have a fantastic access for all service that no one can find and that your chat staff clearly dont know anything about today i had one of the most frustrating and upsetting pieces of customer service and also one of the most brilliant all from the same o educate your staff on what a power of attorney is and what dementia is your chat colleagues reduced me to tears of frustration when all they needed to do was give the phone number of a service you already provide by the time i had found the number on your website i was so upset and frustrated that i almost couldnt speak clearly the wonderful lady on the end of the line was used to dealing with people in that state and was brilliant but why o did it have to come to that dealing with a loved one with dementia is hard enough without stupid security comments asking if the account holder is available and telling me that you can only give general information when all i want to do is register a poa,Bad
2829,i was in the process of joining using the site and wanted to quickly ask someone in chat what i need to do regarding my old supplier as in if i need to contact them or something instead they began to take me through the sales process instead of just answering a single question i find someone trying to sell me something ive already agreed to purchase infuriating,Bad

2839,i received an email saying that if i dont return my router i will be charged the router was returned in the tracked envelope provided nearly months ago the agent was unable to confirm that the router had been received and was unable to provide any reassurance that i would not be charged the just to contact them again if i am they even went so far as to say that they never sent me the email advising of the fine which clearly is from talk talk using their service was nothing short of a nightmare and i cant wait for the day that i never have to deal with this fraudulent company again the internet speeds were basically non existent they constantly blamed it on the routers sending me replacement routers and then i had the pleasure of paying them a monthly fee for a service that didnt work while using my mobile hotspot for internet i honestly could not recommend this company any less and wish that i had never used them,Bad
2840,i was sent an email saying i owed money due to exceeding my call allowance i entered into a new contract on september as a contract lawyer i expected my new contract and new allowance of calls to be doubled as per new contract on the same date as per end of old contract o kept charging me till my bill was they demanded payment my total o contract cost for the previous months was legally a company is unable to penalise an individual as per a court of civil law or a sovereign criminal court the stress i have been through has been immense i have taken a day of leave i have raised a complaint and will be pursuing compensation for my stress and injury to feelings information was terms were used in conversation with call centre workers with double meanings designed to confuse an individual i am clever and this company is being borderline deceptive they take advantage of customers ignorance of the law contract law i issued a legal document of complaint and asked for a written reply today o called me i emailed and asked not to be called and requested a written reply i was ignored and necessitated the need to install a call blocker app as i know the law i was prepared to allow this issue to go to small claims court i will see soon if my credit record has been damaged o now made being aware of the law of the uk have still allowed the bill to accrue further i am still within my day cooling off period my reception here is bad o is the best provider use the o network too still seeking resolution and a written reply to my complaint,Bad
2841,their customer services is more like customer uk based phone staff as far as i can use th century procedures for a st century can only change ownership by post and even that can take up to days ive been trying to do it for nearly months,Bad
2842,virgin media business seems reluctant to honour its own sla customer services are quite willing to hang up on you at any time if you ask a difficult question but reluctant to give their name if asked head office does not answer letters even if signed for this type of customer service will if unchecked damage the virgin brand and spread like a disease through their company it is also the reason i am leaving them the instant my current contract expires,Bad
2843,i should have know better to trust this company ripping me off big time so far they they have done nothing but take money off me charging me for a sim only deal with a joining bonus i havent seen and been charged a termination charge of off vodafone which they said they would pay but it have not seen anything go into my account be careful of all the sweet talkers who are more interested in your money and so eager for a review on trust pilot straight away it goes to show be very care when starting a deal with these,Bad
2844,have been with vodafone for almost years now and can safely say will not be staying any longer than needed was promised when taking out the contract i would be able to upgrade my phone within months something which sold the contract to me after enquiring at this period with staff instore and on the phone i was told as i do not have it in writing this would not be possible and that it is not something the company offers obviously trusting peoples word is not possible with this company i also opted to receive all of my bills online what a brilliant idea you would think and yes it would be if i could actually access the account each time i attempt to log in to my account i have to call vodafone cancel my account and very tedious all i can say is roll on november when i can be clear of this awful company,Bad
2845,so much for loyalty to virgin the longer you stay the more you get charged and what do you get for your money a rubbish tv package with a slow clunky interface a broadband thats equally slow and not fit for purpose and a landline thats virtually redundant in a world where the mobile phone does the same job but infinitely better now ive had enough of a crap and costly service so ill be going with sky but be warned that virgins indian customer service will not let you go without a long protracted fight im no longer bound by a virgin contract so finishing with virgin should be a simple matter of making a call to cancel everything however weve just spent a hour speaking to a clown from customer service who insists that we remain with them and wouldnt take no for an answer literally she wouldnt listen so we asked to speak to a team leader but this too was denied after more than an hour arguing with customer service our package still hasnt been cancelled the entire company and its employees are an absolute disgrace the sheer volume of awful reviews speak for themselves so if youre thinking of buying a virgin media package then dont if youre already a virgin customer then cancel your contract immediately virgin simply have no redeemable qualities whatsoever noone in should expect such abysmal service particularly when there are infinitely better alternatives like sky q and sky glass do not put up with a scam like virgin media with so many disgruntled customers i dont see how virgin can continue operating for much longer i anticipate that they will i hope they do virgin truly is the titanic of media providers and its heading straight for the iceberg you have been warned,Bad
2846,highly not recommending virgin broadband because after month contract they still charging you as much as they like this is fraud really but they extending your contact for another month without letting you know your credit scoring will have missed payment mark because after month direct debit is cancelled but they still providing some services and charging you for it good speed broadband but st customer service every time when you need something you need to hold on the line for min and after that you connecting with pakistan or india and people with knowledge and horrible english saying some to you instead of resolving the problem horrible horrible horrible never again,Bad
2847,constant connection problems never known anything like entire road constantly get disconnected at the most inconvenient of times no compensation this was any other service there would be serious repercussions not with broadband poor service all round wont be renewing,Bad
2848,i wrote an review a few months ago not imagining at the time that it could get i said in my previous review i have always rated vodafone as a top mobile network and ive been with them for most of the last years fact is theyve gone to the dogs i thought it might have been a temporary thing but after a year of fighting with unusable mobile data speeds and now several days of unusable broadband voda system fault not im done i recommend you do not sign a contract with them until theyve sorted themselves out,Bad
2849,if only there is a zero star button this is the worst service provider i have ever signed up with ther has been no joy since day one i could rarely join a zoom meeting while working from home i join all my meetings from my phone using my phone data we couldnt watch our smart tv either i should have known better not to join after seeing the reviews online now i am a victim of this company their customer service is so rude and none of them could help with the issues they are all about the money so their salary can be paid i was charged extra to upgrade to a better service up till today no router was delivered and i am still facing the poor quality service to my surprise one of their staff at the billing department confessed he uses virgin broadband instead i feel dumb to have signed up for this service i want my money back and i am still being asked for a termination fee of this is ridiculous please do not use am really fed up right now and wont hesitate to take it to the next step if nothing is got a call yesterday with a pretence of trying to help but at some point the call ended without any conclusion and no one bothered to call problem now is where is the router you guys charged me would like to terminate this service if no router is delivered and would have to take the case to court as i have had no value for money so is they point of paying for a service when you get nothing in review will be posted on all social media platforms and review platforms if no action is taken following this,Bad
2850,i spent minutes trying to cancel my virgin broadband contract as i was not happy with the latest price increases the call centre staff immediately tried to talk me into other products and i clearly stated i just wanted to cancel i was kept on hold for several minutes while the operative completed some kind of online process i was then transferred to another operative who asked what i wanted and then proceeded to tell me i couldnt cancel my contract without days notice even though the email i received from virgin media said i could cancel without penalty we went round in circles with the operative saying the account could not be cancelled without me agreeing to days notice i was constantly put on hold and there was laughter in the background in the end i just agreed to everything honestly i felt close to tears the operative delivered everything rapid fire and was not easy to understand with all the background noise after being a loyal customer for years im now so relieved that im leaving,Bad
2851,bro its so bad the internet only works half the time who let bro cook honestly its the price is going up but ive had more and more outages since the price change we all need compensation for the bad customer services and the monkeys and chimpanzees that take hrs mins to solve a outage for my area like accc its so bad what to say except its a abomination and it shouldnt be on this planet one mor thing who let bro cook vine boom effect,Bad
2852,before you consider joining vodafone please read mum has been a loyal customer of vodafone for years she has renewed a contract every two years and when i was bought me my first mobile a pay as you go with vodafone these phones eventually graduated onto contracts with mobiles as part of the payment plan my mum has degenerative spinal disease so cannot work and is tremendous amounts of pain every day as i got older and started going out more both me and mum decided that we needed reliable phones so that if i went out and mum had a fall she could easily reach me they are essential as i am now her fulltime carer in january the contract was renewed and we got shiny new samsung galaxy s edges as mum was a loyal customer and had been with vodafone for a long time she received a discount on the plan the total for both phones was a month this discount was supposed to remain in place for the year contract in other words up until january of this year in november of the direct debit got cancelled by the bank possibly due to lack of funds as mum is disabled and cannot work normally if you do not pay your bill vodafone restrict your service yes in our case they didnt from november of up until april of no payments were made and our service wasnt restricted we had no reason to doubt that the bill wasnt going out as the phones never got restricted vodafone never sent a text letter email or even made a phone call to notify us that the bill was adding up in addition to this the line rental increased from for both lines to for each line a month in total unfortunately i have no idea when this was changed as online billing records only go back months however in august of this change had already been made again vodafone failed to inform us of this when we finally discovered this in the april of this year the bill was around the mark my mum rang up to find out why this had happened and why vodafone hadnt notified us of the failure of billing she was instantly blamed by vodafone for not paying the bill and told that it was her fault our lines were also restricted it was finally agreed after many hours of fighting that we would keep our phones and pay a month per line rental totalling a month this is bringing the bill down by a whopping a month we are also now on sim only contracts and with two and a half year old phones that are beginning to break a lot of arguing we were finally put through customer relations and began speaking with a lady named sheetal she has since agreed that the discount was removed prematurely and has refunded us that money she claimed it added up to however i cannot find a refund of this amount on the account anywhere instead one in march which is before we even found out about the bill and one for in may when i asked sheetal if she had compared the data usage of our phones against the months where there was no payments made she said she didnt have the statements and that it would take hours to get them and that she would ring us back on the saturday that was a week an half ago we are still waiting for a return call from of the th of august the bill is despite mum paying the agreed amount of a month we have had our mobile service frequently restricted this happens at least twice a month it has also happened while ive been out and heartbreakingly my mum had a fall which in itself is not that uncommon and normally she can reach me but since vodafone had restricted our service she couldnt call anyone and was stuck on the floor where she had fallen for over two hours this left her in agony for several days and made me feel extremely guilty i have since stopped going out in case it happens again two days ago our service was again restricted despite the payment being made and again we rang up and had an argument with customer relations eventually our lines were reconnected and we were told we would receive a call from sheetal today instead we got a phone call from a man called asif he asked for mum to pay the bill of over a three month payment plan a month forgive me for not working it out when mum tried to explain what the she was disabled and that she would never be able to pay over three months he abruptly cut her off and very rudely said yes i know that and your daughter helps you ive read the notes if he had read the notes then he must have read that is all we can afford a month why after reading that did he ask for a three month payment plan when she explained again that she couldnt pay that much and that is all she can afford he threatened her with our phone numbers being deleted and being taken to court this left my mum in tears fearing bailiffs we are now waiting for sheetal to ring tomorrow hopefully ultimately my argument with vodafone is that they will not admit they made a mistake in failing to either restrict our lines when the bill stopped going through or send out a letter make a phone call or send a text to inform us it isnt about the bill anymore i just wish they would admit they were wrong and take ownership of the suffering they are putting my mum advice to any potential vodafone customer is to run to another company as fast as humanly possible as if this is how they treat loyal customers i can only dread to think of how they would treat new customers,Bad
2853,signal is appalling paying over the odds for rubbish then plus extra charges,Bad
2854,i have been a loyal customer for over years my advice is do not buy services from virgin media appalling and rude customer service worst internet service in years over last month and thats in central london new boxes technician visits and still no joy i will now be leaving do not become a customer unless you enjoy complaining,Bad
2855,awful experience never go with virgin pay the extra and go with another provider i have spent hours on the phone trying to sort broadband which has been turned off for no reason disgusting customer service no solutions and different answers with every call i will be cancelling with them due to numerous problems and lack of any support,Bad
2856,this company has a great product but the customer service is completely useless i dont even know how many hours ive been on hold or in a queue to get through to any department and the last time after over an hour the guy just cut me off,Bad
2857,stay away from this company the customer service is really poor they want to charge me for cancellation when they havent given service i dont have internet i booked an appointment for the internet and the guy didnt come ridiculous service and stuff,Bad
2858,wow just ignorant and really unhelpful unless that is you want to spend money then they are really wanted to upgrade my speeds but they never sent out any equipment so the bt engineer would be able to complete the job oh yeah didnt actually tell me that he would be coming either then moving house is becoming a nightmare constant lying always bt open reaches fault yet weirdly there is a mast socket in my new place so bit strange they would need anything else put myself and my key worker partner with out internet during a home move and refused to provide anything so i have had to source my own mobile wifi and do not care about it also when challenged have no idea about any form of contract notice can hand on heart say this is the worst experience i have ever had and i have ad virgin media and i didnt think anything could be worse than that until nowall i can recommend is to not use these guys,Bad
2859,looking at the vast response to this survey i now feel a little better to know that of customers think bt are had been without a land line and internet for one month last took a string of complaints to sort weeks ago after requesting a new sim card for the mobile it was sent to a previous address we moved from years ago they then sent another sim to our current address with the wrong code on which cut off the mobile and left us with no service sims later and still not working apparently they cannot update a currently have no mobile phone and are waiting for them to issue another sim three weeks without a mobile and still up now should have got another provider to begin with,Bad
2860,i signed up for voda broadband about months ago because they were offering amazon voucher months after the sign up the voucher never arrived voda say its a rd party issue and to contact them however is a bb company and have no contact with their customers customers so basically voda broadband have entirely bribed a customer into a contract and not provided the said gift shocked no just wanted to say dont sign up based of the free offers of stuff because its a scam or a did what they asked me to do on social media i have now reels of screen shots of conversations with vodafone advisers having done absolutely nothing to resolve this issue whats so ever i gave up after different advisers couldnt do anything to even discuss my account if i could post the screen shots i would next stop is a complaint to trading standards because what theyve done is actually a consumer crime,Bad

2872,im a bt costumer for years i just realized that since last month my bill had increased without reason today i contacted the costumer service to clarify what is happening the member of the staff that answer the phone was rude sometimes and just told me that i accept the fact that bt changed the contact i just found out that bt sent an email to the clients on the th of june with weeks notice regarding the fact that the monthly price will go up from july although i never received any email and i wasnt aware about this change and i never consent or accept any update on my previous contract i cant really understand why im paying more for the same service the only option that bt gave to me was pay the same monthly but extending my contract for more months in order to solve this situation on the top of this i ask the person on the phone to speak with the supervisor in order to solve and to find other solutions and apparently she refused to talk with me this is the most unprofessional service i couldnt believe when this guy on the phone to end up saying that not much to do and he will do a complain on my behalf i dont even know what is written on the complain because he said that cant send to me either as far as i can understand from all this situation bt can change your contract without consent from clients just using emails that dont know if will be delivered bt also are able to write on your behalf although bt are not allowed to send the complain through your email and i still dont know what was written where is the sense in all of this story this is not a honest procedure if the idea is to change contracts bt should obtain consent from clients and they can use phone calls and letters to notify as well one email is not the only option and is not enough,Bad

2897,broadband service is great and i have no issue with the actual service the real problem is their approach to customers and make it almost near impossible to downgrade or leave their services all together i have been with vm for a number of years and the few times i tried to downgrade they have almost always found a way to rope me into keeping the same services and lowering the price they are great at buying time and fooling customers into staying by providing temporary cost relief and rope you in to a new month contract when the contract expires you will only notice this when your bill increases by by the time you do eventually reach them months have gone by and you paid a higher tariff during that time vm web is designed to ensure you never cancel downgrade and even upgrade requires you speak to someone all to say that the vm website is just a marketing tool with billing information and a maze of endless breadcrumbs that never lead to what you really want contact is only by phone not web or email or phone so that customers give up the will to live whilst on hold or lose connection after waiting minutes or so its not customer oriented whatsoever in summary vm is one of the most devious and untrustworthy companies in the world that offers a great broadband service and most often forces their customer to cancel direct debits in order to avoid the vm call me and die water torture system,Bad
2898,i have just written a review of my experience today please advise whether you have received it,Bad

2908,one star is far too much for virgin media ill give it stars say no more,Bad
2909,if i could give zero stars i would i am actually sickened at the way this company is treating me about or weeks ago i lost internet connection which was provided by talk talk as i am a secondary school teacher a key worker i was reliant on this for teaching my lessons online and carrying out my duty of care during the most recent lockdown when i informed talk talk of the problem i was experiencing they told me they would be sending out a spare part for me they didnt actually ever check what the problem was they just said they were sending out a spare part not a whole modem just the part this however never came as i was reliant on the internet for carrying out my job and due to talk talks incompetence in fixing the issue i had to rely on buying extra data through my mobile provider and then off my phone so i could access my job i am now left with an almost phone bill as a direct result of this i have contacted talk talk several times about this issue i have also since cancelled my account as i am simply shocked and disgusted at the lack of customer care here not only are they refusing to offer any help advice and compensation for the phone bill i received which again is very much their fault as the reason for this was my home broadband being down but they also have the audacity to after me closing my account send me a final bill from them even though i have not had service from talk talk for over weeks now as i mentioned i have tried to address this countless times over countless platforms not only are they difficult to get ahold of but when i do finally reach someone they are completely unhelpful just today i went through the chat function on their website when the employee of talk talk had enough of listening to the anguish they have put me through they cut me off immediately no warning i was actually part way through typing a message i need help from them they are simply refusing to do this despite the fact that i have been a loyal and regularly paying customer for over years i always held up my end of the contract but the minute i needed any kind of help from them they not only did not provide this but have been actively rude and unhelpful cutting me off and sending final bills furthermore the service i have been paying for has nearly doubled in price over the last years they sneakily tried to bribe me back with the contract i initially signed up with i cannot convey enough how much stress this has caused me at the end of the day i only wanted to do my job as a key worker during a pandemic shame on you talk talk,Bad
2910,topped up yesterday have paypal confirmation that money has been taken out of my account but top up hasnt gone through spoke to somebody called at customers service today who was incredibly rude kept speaking over and raising his voice asked me a multitude of security questions for a pay as you go sim answered some unfortunately couldnt answer some i can not believe how you treat your customers its disgusting i have never been spoken to in this manner want my money back have now blocked my number as i raised a dispute with paypal i can not believe this this is an emergency phone and i was unable to use when in need i rang customer services and was told i need to write an email to get in unblocked the lady i spoke to was unhelpful and like she was reading from a script can you unblock my number i have just received an email from trustpilot saying that have reported my review for not being genuine im actually so shocked at the extent that this company would go to to hide the bad reviews they get funny how after i get an email saying that my review was ingenious i check trustpilot and all of sudden they have brilliant reviews all posted at the same sort of time hmmm wonder who really is the ingenuous one,Bad
2911,just had a pointless conversation with bt apparently they can increase prices and content during your contract and there is nothing you can do about it by the way it is a verbal contract which again there is nothing you can do consumer law says that no provider can hold you in contract for more than years and once this has passed you can move your account any time,Bad
2912,i wished to switch my mobile from talktalk to another provider i phoned their helpdesk who provided me with a porting authorisation so far so good i inserted my new sim into my phone i found that talktalk had locked the phone to their network it was unlocked when i switched to talktalk a year nature of my complaint is that as i understand the situation talktalk had the information that i wish to had the information that my phone is locked to knows that an unlock request takes has not unlocked my phone and not told me that an unlock is is therefore expecting me to find out after i have been disconnected from talktalk when i attempt to connect with my new provider that an unlock is necessary then request an unlock then wait days with no i did an online chat to resolve this situation the chatter was totally unsympathetic and unhelpful an unlock takes days thats it as part of that chat i had a complaint raised which was supposed to be responded to within i followed up days later in another chat i was told that the chatter could not access the previous chat to obtain the background there was no trace of my unlock request the day complaint would be responded to eventually as they had a lot of complaints to handle i can believe that now have another day wait for an unlock code without service,Bad

2975,android kitkat is the most recent android version released which obviously mitigates the latest cve security vulnerabilities effecting all previous versions of android tmobile has been like so many other providers slow to upgrade certain android phones not to mention the fact that theyve been selling phones which cannot accept the latest upgrades to the android operating system like the lg optimus leaving those customers phones vulnerable to the aforementioned cve these customers opt to purchase a new phone with android already installed that seems to be the only option tmobile is willing to currently offer to this obviously growing and insidious problem with security vulnerabilities the current cve vulnerabilities effecting all versions of android prior to android kitkat include the following the first of which are classified with high severity by the national cve vulnerability database cve remove device locks android through allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and remove device locks via a crafted application that invokes the method in the class with the cve android before does not properly arrange for seeding of the openssl which makes it easier for attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging use of the within multiple cve in android before uses the api in conjunction with creating an object of the class which allows attackers to execute arbitrary java code by leveraging access to the at certain android api cve the function in in the implementation in apache harmony through m as used in the java cryptography architecture jca in android before and other products when no seed is provided by the user uses an incorrect offset value which makes it easier for attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging the resulting predictability as exploited in the wild against bitcoin wallet applications in august severity why tmobile would sell phones that because of internal hardware restrictions could no longer be upgraded to the latest most secure versions of android is yet a question im sure many frustrated customers want the answer to including myself we are only rightfully concerned about the security of our providers like tmobile have left these customers to fend for themselves this is quite disconcerting to say the least and yet tmobile refuses to enact due diligence with regard to this problem by offering a haphazard solution which heaps further financial burden upon the customer by simply telling them to by a new phone with android installed to say the least that is a deplorable way to do business i financed my lg optimus l phone brand new not too long ago and only have a small balance remaining to pay this phone off yet when i asked tmobile what they could offer me as far as making a switch to a new phone ie a provisional credit that would apply to my account pending the purchase of a new android said they cannot do that and that my only option would be to simply go to a tmobile store to assess the value of my current phone toward the purchase of a new one of course as the tmobile rep i spoke with so candidly pointed the phone is used and may have blemishes this could significantly diminish any value it may have it is not my fault tmobile contracted with lg to develop these phones that would undoubtedly become walking security risks down the road and it is not my fault that the manufacturer cannot provide a secure os upgrade to these phones to say the least i am very frustrated over with regard to this matter concerning the threat to the android operating system by malware that seeks to exploit cve vulnerabilities such as these tmobile should not be taking these kinds of risks with the security of its customers devices to say the is highly irresponsible whats more the fact that tmobile is not offering a sufficient reprieve for these customers effected by this problem is quite disturbing in effect tmobile is saying to these customers too bad youll just have to buy a new phone current solution to this problem is quite disproportionate with regard to the fact that tmobile customers have no control over the update process and yet ironically have been told by tmobile that tmobile takes their customers security very seriously despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary tmobile needs to man up to this problem in an ethical manner if it ever hopes to win back the customer loyalty it has already lost as a result of this problem as far as im concerned at this point tmobile only seems to care more about profit than it does about the security of the devices it sells to its customers despite whatever disinformation campaign tmobile will try to come up with the proof is in the pudding the evidence is right here in black and white and yet here we go again with another company that only seems to want to stick it to the customer rather than provide quality products with reasonable guarantees and customer service,Bad
2976,never known such poor customer service i have been a customer for over years and recently reported a fault with incoming cable to the bt master call centre would not attend to re clip their cable without a engineer over per month and they wont sort their own equipment go elsewhere and save money its a principle thing now,Bad

2984,im actually a customer which was then bought by tt unfortunately before the take over everything went smooth and nice since tt has taken over i experience constant disconnects now by that i dont mean like every minutes more like every secs literally as soon as i have restarted the router i have a disconnect the next sec ive replaced all my hardware such as filter cable and router nothing helped tt to send me an engineer who probably just come and touch few things before charging me quid so i rejected that offer also the package im on right now is the essential pack so normal broadband with evening we calls apart from the fact that i have to call up customer service like every days the funny thing is they dont really address the problem but merely advertise how awesome fibre optic is and try to convince to step up at all cost they never went straight to the point on the phone eg if my call lasted minutes minutes would be them telling me how i would benefit from fibre and those disconnects wont happen but i dont need fibre optic since i havent got too much time to stream music nor movies my brother has to go to bed early in the morning coz he needs to get up at half in the morning for school and comes home at in the afternoon he barely got time to do his homework and at this age in time almost everything is done online now you can imagine how furious everyone in the household was and you cant just go to the school and tell the teachers that your internet isnt working if my brother couldnt do his homework next issue the phone is so noisy in the background we can barely make calls no one can understand us and vice versa also in addition to the frequent horrible disconnects someone uses the us the internet would get disconnected so thats a double kick in the face its a disgrace really luckily since i was a customer were only on a rolling contract and will be soon switching to another provider most probably vm its amazing that ive actually managed to put up with this disgusting service for freaking three whole years i obviously cant express my anger towards this company and how badly they have affected me by cutting off my internet but let me tell you something i cant wait til i get a new provider it will be a release like never before,Bad
2985,disaster trying to contact customer service few days before my contract ended they just kept passing me on to another call handler after nearly two hours they said they would end contract and customer service will return a call to enquire why cancelling person who called could hardly speak english informed i just wish to end contract and nothing more they started asking security questions which i refused to give as i felt was being spam now theyve sent a new bill shocking customer service never clear,Bad
2986,absolutely horrific i was with them for years at a discounted rate and the package cost was going up to per month so it was time to leave i spoke with someone late april who advised that because it took days notice to cancel my services would be on until the nd of may and my full bill of would come out on may the th however i would receive around back as i only used the services for half the month i agreed to this and the cancellation was put in place as confirmed my services closed down on the nd without a second to spare and my new system was installed fast forward to the th of june and i see theyve decided to take another out my account despite me having no contract with them this came out of my joint account used for other bills and food so this caused other dds to be missed on the day i called them immediately absolutely furious understandably and was told there was nothing they could do other than send a cheque for the now they owed me i told them i couldnt wait for a cheque so they advised on raising an indemnity claim via my bank to get it back quicker i done this on the day and waited a few days for barclays to get back to me they then got in touch to advise virgin had declined the claim tell you what ive never been so angry in all of my life couldnt of written the then spent nearly hours on the phone demanding escalations to someone who would authorise a same day refund as i was now down and needed the money back in to cover the missed bills and my food shopping for the remainder of the month the people i spoke with of them part of their complaints team and then that persons manager couldnt of cared less and continually told me it wasnt something they could do i asked them to confirm if virgin media had an accounts team which they told me no and they then repeatedly told me that their only refund method is via cheque this is one of the biggest uk media companies available never mind their other worldwide services the service was horrific i had to end the call before i said something i regretted but i was told i would get a callback within hours to discuss anything else they could do and compensation its now a week later and ive heard absolutely nothing they should be absolutely ashamed of the service theyre providing i wont let this go never have i ever dealt with some a shambolic group of people on the phone either im always quick so note its not their personal fault but my god the level of and unwillingness to admit that taking unsolicited pounds out of an ex customers accounts is completely in touch now you stable of absolute cowboys,Bad
2987,the worst provider experience i have ever had as i was looking to move on from three i chose vodafone as they had reasonable pay monthly offers after purchasing a pay monthly plan and submitting my pac code to transfer my three number i was instantly hit with issues creating an account sorting delivery of my sim and speaking to customer service with big wait times even on the live chat after all this i decided to just cancel the vodafone contract with the sim which still hadnt arrived i was told you cant cancel anywhere other than by calling them which i did after another long wait and on the call they also confirmed that my three mobile number will not be moved over and the transfer request had been successfully cancelled after the mess with vodafone i chose a different contract with ee with the same number transfer process once my ee sim arrived my three sim stopped working as the number was transferred and released but unfortunately not transferred to ee at this point it seemed my three number had vanished into thin air ee told me they did not have my number and to get a new pac code and three couldnt get a new pac code as the number had already been released by them i endured two and a half weeks of discussions and being sent round in circles between three ee and vodafone who were all saying my three number was not with them and each telling me to speak to the other provider i was in so many live chats that in the end i gave up and had to write an email directly to the ee ceo who finally got me in touch with a senior member of the ee team they were extremely helpful and explained that the number was most likely with vodafone and guided me through the usual number transfer process i finally spoke to someone at vodafone who could confirm my three number had actually been transferred to them but was inactive despite me cancelling the contract having someone confirm to me multiple times it would not be moved over and many hours speaking to tech support members at vodafone who were also all saying they didnt have my number at vodafone it was still transferred to them the tech support member who finally told me vodafone had my number said the only way to get a new pac code was to get a new vodafone sim have my three number moved on to it then request a new pac code from that sim the guy in the vodafone store also told me that my number wasnt with them but i just bought a sim anyway after buying the sim with the mandatory minimum top up i spoke to someone else on the tech support team at vodafone who told me that they could just send me the pac code and i didnt actually need to get a sim to top it off when i put the vodafone sim in my phone to call them i received a message saying that i was part of a top up plan and i was now going to be charged a month i definitely didnt agree to that and was automatically opted in and the only way to cancel was to call them up again and do it over the phone i have honestly never had a worse customer experience in my entire life and i would genuinely avoid vodafone like the plague there are massive wait times over the phone and on the live chat in comparison to ee and three and everyone on the tech support team seems to tell you something different each time you contact them i image its smooth sailing if you never have a technical issue but if you do god help you,Bad
2988,they cancelled my order twice without telling me on the third time they suggested i just get standard broadband to begin with so it could be installed faster in all it took months from my initial order to get a phone line and internet set up in my new house and they never did come back to set up the fibre broadband in addition to this the bt sport app never works with apple tv like they advertise about halfway through my contract my line went dead and it took them a month to fix it and they charged me for that month the internet discount connects for a few hours at least once a month thankfully my contract is now up and i am going elsewhere talk talk,Bad

3063,it should have been simple but it wasnt i wanted to make changes to my virgin media package ive been a customer for over ten years and wasnt surprised when yet again they have made a complete and utter cock up of things all i wanted were two new v boxes to replace my tivo and mums v plus box i explained i wanted this in order to remotely record programmes for mum i am disabled and she lives upstairs which i cannot climb the enthusiastic agent quoted me just for everything boxes new hub and installation which i agreed to but asking him to repeat times as i couldnt quite believe it the install date was about weeks away but i was happy to go ahead and wait just before the installation date i noticed the price was double and queried it i was told that due to a communication error i was only given the price for one and that the agent had failed to write it down so essentially this meant my word against his i asked for a complaint to be escalated and was eventually put through to a man who seemed to rather enjoy his position of manager and told me to either be happy to go ahead with it or cancel the installation i said i would go ahead but wanted to state i was unhappy with the outcome so he then told me i could not go ahead unless i was happy with his decision to say things got heated from there on is an understatement i said i wondered wether the agent i originally placed the order with realised his mistake and hence neglected to write the real amount down if virgin media truly value their customers especially those of us who have shown them loyalty for many years it would not have been impossible to honour the original amount and believe me the manager behaved in a patronising manner and i cancelled the installation team and called customer retention who apologised and negotiated a fairer option for me so it proves it can be done eh i then rang to query the installation date and was yet again given a different option much better than the previous but meant me installing the equipment myself i mentioned a few times im disabled with severe mobility problems but would ask for my brother to help so today he came over and spent and a half hours trying to install the boxes which we the found out after all this time flipping engineer i am now seeking a dark room to have a nice lie down and my brother who works long shifts was not surprisingly a bit cross well expletives were involved too i am going to look into changing to sky or another provider in the near future the agents either dont know how things work but are very pleasant or are completely petty patronising jobs worthy cretins like the manager who i spoke too seriously really think hard before you consider this media ochre outfit,Bad
3064,the service i received was awful spoke with advisors and on the chat for hours and the issue is not resolved the person on the chat was the most helpful the advisors were not in the least are submitting a complaint on the service i have been with virgin media for i would say about years and very disappointed in the service,Bad
3065,the customer services are another network if possible,Bad
3066,im not sure of his position but the manager at the front of the store dan according to his badge was very unhelpful and kept telling me to call up customer services on the phone even though i had told him several times that i had tried this and had no success cant wait to leave vodafone,Bad
3067,absolutely s hit customer service but i guess nothing will change because you never listen,Bad

3075,terrible wifi constantly going out cant even connect if youre in the other room in this house i use my phone hotspot of the time mcdonalds wifi is better than thisi went to university and post office wifi was a lot better and sharing wifi with like other people had less problems than sharing a virgin media wifi with people,Bad
3076,poor customer service just joined and they gave me a window to deliver something i called up to ask if they could come after pm and the woman on the phone spoke to me like sh on her shoe disgusting ive literally been a customer for like a day and ive already had enough,Bad
3077,having been a mug for the last years and putting up with their bull for so long my experience tonight has cemented the fact that i will be leaving them at next renewal they are a a disgrace to humans not only are they rude extremely unhelpful and massively ignorant they lie then lie again to cover their original lie then never admit any responsibility for anything they have said how they have not been done by trading standards is a mystery and how theyve managed to get away with such awful customer service for all these years is also baffling i have always had terrible experiences with them since the start so i telephoned them tonight under no impression that it was going to end pleasantly god was i right i seriously cannot express into text how disgustingly vile they are and how my blood pressure really cant take it anymore im in my s and in general good health but i fear every time i call them it will end with me keeling over from the stress ive always thought they were better than sky in terms of the products and services but trust me when i tell you no technology or slightly faster broadband is worth any of it just dont do it to yourself give your precious money to sky or freeview anyone that is not virgin media,Bad
3078,cost expensive and never received any satisfaction regarding speeds etc,Bad
3079,on the phone to virgin for the rd time today first two times they kept me waiting for more than half hour then cut me off i left a message on one of their numbers i rang when they were connecting us but no call back ive now been waiting for we hadnt bothered also went on to live chat only to be off with a mobile phone to text my question to so they can get back to no seriously virgin get your act together and start valuing your customers right not to waste their time waiting for you to answer the phone whilst meanwhile paying for a rubbish service when you could probably make it better you have gone down hill fast in my regrets already and will not be recommending,Bad
3080,bt for far too long have got away with an out priced broadband service that is a disgrace for a once leader in f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this company,Bad
3081,ordered a sim card over a week ago and still not had it yet reordered another and not received that yet not very impressed,Bad
3082,the worst customer service experience of my life rude agents and getting off ordered a contract got sent a replacement sim card no apology what so ever,Bad

3086,i had been with tmobile for over years and were a pretty good company then they became ee and the service was a joke no reception at my home address rude staff no customer loyalty and then a debt letter for an amount id never heard of i asked them what it related to and they have never responded except to get a debt recovery company involved so i have had to ask again months later what this amount relates to before i pay it i would tell anyone to avoid ee much happier with vodafone,Bad
3087,trying to leave virgin is extremely frustrating not leave mid contract at the end of the contract they will not take your day notice that you dont wish to continue ive called times and im now going back and forth with a bot on they just keep trying to sell even the bot tried to sell and with every offer the price keeps going up ive had to just cancel the direct debit its impossible,Bad
3088,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
3089,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad
3090,i moved to virgin in august the first weeks the internet worked fine and had a good speed cooling off period you know then i started losing the connection intermittently every couple of hours then a week later the internet kept going off every minutes and reconnecting minutes later this went on for weeks as we are all working from home this made it impossible for me to work and caused me immense problems at work apparently at this stage you would realize that it is easier to speak to god than to virgin support there is number which no one picks and i wasted hours of my life waiting on this number then i got on to twitter they advised a text service number which is a basically a bot messenger working in loop advising you to reboot or reset i did it times no luck then they will cleverly hide any way of making a will then share an email id to make raise the issue but would never reply to the basically i have no internet for months and that too in london and no resolution and no way of contacting my advise stay away from virgin media is basically a con shop nothing what they advertise i believe this is true for all virgin brands,Bad
3091,terrible customer service no help at all the agents dont even understand what youre telling them and keep repeating themselves i had issue with my internet and all they wanted to do was to get me to pay for an engineer to come out which i have to pay for from my pocket i managed to fix the issue myself without their help bunch of useless people trying to make money off you i was online with them for and a half hours waste of time,Bad
3092,i thought they had improved as a company what a load of crap their tv is not user friendly and very hard to use plus you cant get to talk to anyone i cancel direct debit disconnected everything go back to preview and ordered myself a stay away at all cost,Bad
3093,service is extremely unreliable sometimes disappearing altogether and other times only around mbps rather than the advertised trying to complain about this im only met by a bot who tells me to do the obvious resets but then cant do anything else when these fail i have the performance record to substantiate these claims,Bad
3094,customer service is awful dont bother with this rip off business on nd year they signed me up to some third party over when i contacted them they promised to stop it and never did took another months finally cancelled it no april contract was ending gave months notice they told me last payment was due in days i paid this cancelled direct debit and now im getting all sorts of threats total due to corona every phone no useless shops bunch of o opens their shops ill go and bully their staff see how they like that,Bad
3095,terrible to deal with and very service for business is very bad they constantly lose authorisation for colleagues to deal with accounts so time is wasted going through security i have already cancelled contracts due to this reason as colleagues found it difficult to deal with vodafone for minor issues also online payment doesnt work and when trying to pay directly from the business bank account the sort code and account brings up other companies vodafone libra and ltd which the business customer service dept doesnt even know about and told me its a problem they have to sort out and all i am trying to do is pay a contract expires end of this year and i will be changing i was with o before and never had a a phone contract it is not meant to be so stressful and stop me running a business i have been on the phone for mins,Bad
3096,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad
3097,considering how highly they regard their service it is pretty poor rarely get a connection and g coverage isnt as good as they state they made cancelling my contract an absolute hassle and try and hide the option on their website so that you stay with them upon cancelling i was told by customer services that i would be refunded the remaining term on my contract when i used my new pac code however when i rang to get my new pac code they said they were charging me for days again not a horrendous company but think many other providers do a much better job,Bad
3098,terrible service fraudulent company customer service was one of the worst ever after waited on the phone for mins i finally got through to he was so rude and have given a zero star if possible stay away from mobile if you need better service,Bad
3099,disgusting price hike only been two months and you are putting the price up a i am rid of you i will never come back and i advise no one to ever use o they are crooks,Bad
3100,its a rubbish company they give a fix price years contract but after month they change to and last month they change to even they told me they never change a price he promised me his name recommend to everyone no one use a talk talk,Bad
3101,i had a installation date set weeks before i moved and it was cancelled on last day and i have to stay weeks without network thanks virgin,Bad
3102,personally i would like to give this company a minus star rating but not allowed unfortunately star is still too around this company is designed to suck your bank account dry with its in contract price hikes i got the same speed fibre at half the price with no price hikes from another company talk not getting into customer service from virgin but this sucks getting stung with final payment when i disconnected was a nice parting gesture which in turn spurred me on to write this review,Bad
3103,no customer service you cant even understand what they are saying not helpful i would avoid using them as a provider,Bad
3104,they may give you a good deal to tempt you as a customer but if you have any problems just be warned dont expect an easy or quick resolution i joined in april despite several follow ups still not been paid a voucher i was supposed to receive within days ive also been unable to register my account online to access my bills etc two very painful one hour calls where you get bounced round different departments and still no resolution to what should be a simple fix they promise to call in a few days for an update complete lies as im the one doing the chasing sky is more expensive but id rather pay a bit more for much better customer service i will be cancelling my virgin contract after the month contract period,Bad
3105,exceptionally bad connection speed unable to use their service for the past two months not worth the money or is not a wifi issue i have tested the speeds from the router to the exchange and im getting upload for a business line i have to tether from my mobile to complete my work why am i paying vm for a service which isnt fit for purpose,Bad
3106,unless we are by the router we dont get wifi our tv is constantly buffering not happy at all xx,Bad
3107,all my data for the month of december was used in one day when id been at home all day on wifi i was told this would be investigated and id receive an email within working days after working days i contacted them again and was told id get a reply by the following day but still nothing i had to chase yesterday and was told i must have had an app running in the background totally useless and appalling customer service ill be getting a new phone soon and it will not be with o,Bad
3108,my son got a contract seemed good deal really low monthly cost yet almost every month a few days after the bill was paid he got outgoing calls barred as he was over his credit cap no joy from carphone warehouse my guess is that he was going over his and was getting hit by excessive charges he only ever used data for fb and twitter and not for downloading music or vids when he was at work he used wifi should be avoided at all costs hes recently switched to payg will be interesting to see his data useage now in realtime,Bad
3109,drops out without warning for hours on end when it was first installed i was getting speeds of mbs on a mbs line which was fantastic three months into my contract and now it i cant even stay online for the duration of a movie on netflix i run the diagnostics through their website which constantly reports that everything is fine making me wonder if it is all just a classic psychological trick to ensue customer peace of are people in this household and we are all fairly heavy users gaming streaming etc so the fact they are throttling my connection even though im paying for a premium ftth service is completely tried everything suggested by their customer service team to get back online when it drops out their phone line isnt free from a mobile but the only thing that ever works is waiting for it to sort itself out sometimes taking up to hours i cant even work from home when im not feeling well because i dont trust the still have months on my contract so i cant just switch providers without paying a huge cancellation fee mbs sounds great on paper but given my experience thus far id be much better off with a quarter of the speed on bt,Bad
3110,i pay for broadband service virgin connected us to the neighbours property the neighbours complained about their split signal they got virgin to disconnect us i am now without internet until the cabling to our property is finally properly sorted while still paying for a service and finding myself with no internet connection for days which is highly problematic for me virgin have to much power and no work ethics or sense of service its a huge ma june unable to deliver the service they promised and should not have such a share of the market to avoid whenever possible,Bad
3111,no thanks all rubbish price deals cant beat threes g and before anyone says anything the g where i live is meters away from my house im getting max and minimum is when its its live only just november in my postcode im paying for a unlimited data sim and use my own g router unlocked tcl g cpe wouldnt touch virgin media with a overpriced and greedy rip off ever again,Bad
3112,closed my account st july due a refund after several calls over several months and complaints until now th november still nothing im still waiting for this invisible cheque im promised every time i called if this was the other way round im sure id have bailiffs at my door by now virgin media you are disgusting and i will taking this to your regulating body,Bad
3113,an absolute shambles as bad as bt worst company i have ever dealt with cancelled contract and paid outstanding amount months later letter comes through saying pay up or else we will effect your credit rating but i dont owe anything minutes of going around in circles i submit and pay because i cant get them to understand that i have paid everything i owe them months previously and because ill do anything to get vodafone out of my the worst decision i made to go with them in the first place please dont do it they are a nightmare,Bad
3114,some years ago i used vodafone for broadband and the service was great only moved due to a deal with another isp so i thought i would go back to them and what a mistake that was ive had no broadband at all customer services are a total joke dont listen to anything you say text you reference numbers which arent correct ive been told id have four call backs not one of them happened i havent had broadband for almost one week and im currently moving to another isp after been on the phone hours with them and getting nowhere i decided to cancel and lose my number cant get over how bad this company is,Bad
3115,where do i start with bt firstly it took over a month to get my services connected a month i had to pay for because there was a shortage of engineers i paid for line rental upfront for a year to realise i was being charged monthly for line rental after months so i was paying twice months into my contract i am still paying monthly for line rental i have already paid for when my broadband stopped working it took over days to fix it because the engineers didnt turn up oh and the engineers only work so you have to take a day off work if you work normal office hours to get it fixed in the end it took engineer bookings for someone to actually turn up and fix it the call centre is a joke you end up repeating yourself over and over again to people who you know cant help you im leaving asap,Bad
3116,my internet connection is awful i have raised this issue with you numerous times with no response very poor in all areas dealing with virgin media would never recommend you,Bad
3117,o priority shut off of st patricks day supposed to be offering free drinks on a thursday nowhere in the tcs does it say any days are excluded but to just shut the service at the designated time is very poor just ordered my ee sim,Bad
3118,i closed my account with virgin and moved else where as they are to my account was all paid off little did i know six months down the line virgin media didnt finalize there end and send off to equifax that my account was settled and paid my credit score has had a huge impact on me and cant take credit out is everything these days and virgin have taken this away from me i paid my bills on time how can this happen to a paying customer,Bad
3119,not even close to providing the internet speed promised they blamed the smart tv for reducing the speed to less than mbps they are a complete joke,Bad
3120,i have been with o for sometime and a few spurious charging issues decided it was time to leave on screen my contract finished th june i have a screen shot but when i rang customer services to discuss getting my pac code i was told the contract ended in july and their would be a termination fee i asked what that fee would be and was told by the operator pence the actual figure on the bill was i spoke to o to resolve this issue but they were adamant that the bill was correct i am now taking my complaint to,Bad
3121,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
3122,very disappointed in the after sales service i have received since i upgraded my phone on was told the transfer of my number would taken about minutes it actually ended up taking hours which caused massive problems as i am self employed and require my phone for work i had to make many calls to be exact to your call centre to try to get this sorted each time being told it would be sorted asap and that i would receive a call i am still waiting once this was eventually sorted out i requested a call back from a manager due to my disappointment at the service i have received again i am still waiting for this call i received an email for a bill which is a lot higher than i was told to expect so again i called back to query this times in total and i am still waiting for a call back i have been a customer of o for many years and i have never felt so let down and disappointed in the service that i have received from a company the fact that i have still not received any of the call backs i was promised is disgusting surely as a customer i should receive better service than this or is it because i have purchased an item and i am now committed to a contract are you frankly not bothered about what service i this is how it is coming across i would appreciate it if someone could please contact me to discuss this further,Bad
3123,awful service in all aspects whilst the speed of the broadband is good the the actual amount of time you get to use it is a joke constant faults which take two or three days to fix each time and when you try to call to report any issues the staff couldnt care less and dont even bother asking for a small refund for the downtime you receive as this will not happen even though unlike other providers who run off the open reach network therefore are not liable for any fault issue this is the virgin network same issues with the tv with constant faults and little to no care taken by the staff steer well clear,Bad
3124,do not get your services virgin media do not allow you to leave and then try to charge you when your contract is finished they have tried to do this to my father im on the phone now trying to argue on his behalf virgin are actually a bunch of crooks do not use if you have elderly parents i cancelled services when contract run out had a confirmation email saying exactly that thought it was still they are charging my father for services he no longer has and want to argue disgusting and is the second time ive left a review because the first time they were rude to my father on the phone thats when you can even understand what theyre saying poor is an understatement,Bad
3125,vodafone team and their executives are not at all they are least bothered about customers problem and every time they will have a nice reason to not resolve your problem my number is not in use from month and everyday i take follow up to change from postpaid to prepaid but they are least interested about the same even have mailed many times to higher authority regarding the same but even they are so shameless that even they dont bother to resolve the problem instead they tell mam you port your number so nonsense behave of your team if you cant resolve and your customers are not imp for you then close your business and just get lost i would request all the customer who are reading this please port to some other network because they find it funny to help and resolve our problems shame on higher authority too that you are not capable enough to resolve my problem,Bad
3126,shockingly bad and insensitive customer service when dealing with a account spoken to them four times and each time apologised to and assured contract cancelled and no outstanding balance only to receive each month another email to account holders email asking for money then they unbelievably passed it on to a debt collection agency who were quick to apologise on phone when called and cancelled the debt and also put in an official complaint on behalf of my sister and i tescos system for dealing with accounts where the holder has passed away has to be changed,Bad
3127,if i could give them less stars i would my advice to everyone when they will try to disconnect virgin is to record all the calls because all they do is lying they will find a thousand excuses just to make you pay a few extra bills very disappointed and i wouldnt advise anyone connecting to virgin i hope i really hope that someone is gonna take them to court and take a thousands out of then and their lies,Bad
3128,please find an alternative broadband provider to cant comprehend how companies as large as talktalk and are so inept and been without broadband for days now and they cant manage to book and engineer between them ive spent nearly hours on the phone over the last day and wasted half a day off waiting for an engineer not to turn upi only scored star as isnt urge you not to use talktalk,Bad
3129,i have been an orange customer for many many years and up until now theyve been great ive taken out a number of month contracts with them over the years and for my loyalty orange gave me a discount their customer service used to be excellent i have an iphone and with my discount i pay per month for unlimited minutes unlimited text messages and g of data per latest contract has been running for just over years and this timed perfectly with the iphone release so i phoned orange and after being on hold for a good minutes was told that the best they could do for me is for me to pay upfront for the phone and then per month for months thereafter and my data allowance would go down to g per month the total payable would be i did not go ahead with the upgrade and after some thought called orange again to see if they could offer me a better deal the man i spoke to said that i could pay for the phone and with my discount only per month for g of data much better this only totals i decided to go ahead with this upgrade deal he told me hed just put me on hold for a few second while he sorts it out then instead of putting me on hold he cut me offi phoned orange again and was again on hold for another minutes i explained that id been cut off she told me the man id spoken to before had not put any notes on my account so i went through it all again i was then told that id been given incorrect information and that id have to pay for the phone and per month after discount then she queried my loyal customer discount and told me that id have to give this up because apple wont allow any discount with the iphone thus i would have to pay per month plus the for the phone totalling my discount is for my loyalty to orange not apple so all those years as an orange customer dont mean a thing if i want the iphone upgrade im utterly disgusted with having been given different prices each time i called for the same product and then told that basically my loyalty means sweet fa anymore im not sure that orange deserve my loyalty anymore to be honest,Bad
3130,engineer came to connect line couldnt get it to work but said it would work later and left he was dismissive of my explanation of the likely problem i was unable to receive calls next day phoned customer services spoke to several employers many of whom very difficult to understand and i had to explain the problem three of four times before any of them understood what the problem was i was told that the problem couldnt be fixed due to a technical problem but an engineer would ring me back later that day no telephone call a week later i checked online and my fault report had been closed but still no working telephone phoned customer services again spoke to various people who couldnt help eventually spoke to someone in a different department about minutes into the call i was put on hold only for me to be redirected to the message saying that my call was in a queue at the end of an hourlong conversation they still couldnt sort it out at that time due to a technical problem but i would be phoned the following day meanwhile i was automatically signed up for paperless billing because i was going to pay by direct debit i have tried over three weeks to log into my online account but have been unable to log into my account because whenever i try to confirm my email address by clicking the link in the email they sent me i get a message saying that due to a technical error my address cannot be confirmed at this time today i spoke to the billing department at great length after being put on hold four or five times often due to a technical problem i eventually had my previous online account closed and a new one created i was sent login details but these are not recognised when i try to log in so i still cannot receive calls on my phone and i cant get online to view my bill and find out what sums of money theyre taking from me i can see weeks of stress and annoyance ahead,Bad

3151,declining company no support all their systems are down you can not speak with a human nor even set up a direct debit this is the most expensive provider in the uk,Bad
3152,why cant we leave less than star so after a horrendous experience with previously i decided to try talk talk broadband was to be switched on wednesday th may engineer arrives on time from good start dial tone achieved then says broad band might not work for a couple of hours until the provided switch it on ok now sunday th may its still not on i called friday th but it could not be resolved called again today they will try and schedule an engineer now sunday night and no scheduled datetime yet apparently there is an issue with the open reach scheduling system i say surely the engineer should have checked it was working before leaving apparently if i have an issue with an engineer i cant complain through my provider but i dont have a contract with open reach how can i complain to a body i dont have a contract with also believe it or not i still have to pay for supply from last wednesday even though it is not working cant believe it horrendous the level of service will update again not doubt shortly with the next watch this space go to bt the engineers deliver better for bt than other providers,Bad
3153,do you fancy being put on hold for over an hour in total do you want to speak to people who can barely understand english and just put you on hold after taking your name time and time again do you want to pay p a minute just to talk to someone at customer services who cant even sort out sending a sim card to an address then look no further than the catastrophically bad orange customer services,Bad
3154,the worst company i have ever had to deal with coming to the end of my year contract which i wished to end earlier at a cost of course their customer service is appalling it took nearly hours to get them a to give me a final figure different ones and b to get someone actually to raise the days notice of closure they pass you from one team to another four in my case although they wanted to pass me to a fifth they hope you will simply go away i would rather have teeth extracted than to deal with vodafone again i shall unlock the phone and go elsewhere for a deal vodafone avoid,Bad
3155,horrible company appalling support i signed for a month mobile phone contract with ee including a device from day one i was facing issues with data being useless for the longest part of the day in my workplace which made my contract useless although their website claims great g coverage in the area and i was getting full signal i spoke with support within the first days and they let me know that there was an issue in the are which should be solved very soon after a month passed and i couldnt cancel my contract anymore their support started claiming that there is no issue and i have to test with another companys sim card on my phone which wasnt feasible as my device was locked down to ee i was also asked to run some tests which failed cause apparently i could get absolutely no data on my device during the rush hour my case at some point was also escalated to level two support who recognised the problem as i was providing the evidence they were requesting but no solution was being provided after months of frequent calls to them they provided me with a solution i could cancel my contract with no cancellation fee and return my phone yes return the device i was paying for months without receiving a refund for that money or anything on the meanwhile i had tested my sim card on another device and the results were the same i was also having great speeds while i was on roaming which was proving that there was no issue with either my device or the sim course i didnt accept that offer as i found it an absolute steal why should i accept a cancellation with no refund although i was paying for a gb plan because i need data for my work and also the device they were asking me to return without receiving even a partial refund ee sent me a letter and they advised me to open a case with ombudsman services which ended up to be the worst waste of time i had ever had in my whole life as their decision was against me although my evidence was proving it wrong when i appealed that initial decision proving it wrong using my and ees evidence like their own supports notes the final decision came against me again with no actual evidence i had options after that accept or reject the decision or just leave it no matter what i chose the result was that the case was being resolved for them what a waste of time a month ago months after my first call to ees customer service support this issue got surprisingly solved during that time ee had prefered to spend my time and keep their employees busy lying on me and plenty of my colleagues who were facing the same issue the result is that everyone whose contract ended has left the company i will also leave ee for sure no matter the fact that the issue i was facing has been solved months after i started my contract with them even if they make me an offer less than half the price of any other carriers the reason is that ee was proved to be horribly unreliable and untrustworthy as a company and at the end of the day the amount of time theyve made me waste with them costs more than the money i have wasted which is already too much,Bad
3156,very poor service and unable to sort out the problem,Bad
3157,terrible customer broadband has been extremely slow had to go through so many checks multiple times before anyone would help its clear they are reading off a script on the online chat as they just ask you the same thing again without checking any notes finally they agreed to send out a talk talk engineer engineer said router etc all fine and that a open reach engineer was required and that it was a through out issue multiple calls later from ourselves and they finally agreed to send out an open reach engineer the engineer then said that there is no issue with the line and that its a talk talk issue so we are now back to square one its impossible to work from home with a poor connection and talk talk just dont seem to want to help us weve messaged on social media and just want someone to pick up the phone and speak to us as weve had be moving provided asap,Bad
3158,the links dont work the password reset facility is a farcical the chat advisors cant write in english the website says i can change my plan yay but there is no way to change it on the website lol how can someone get paid to make this website never known anything like it only came on to cancel my gfs account and even that cant be done online terrible terrible god awful website,Bad

3167,i have been today around pm visiting the ee shop in bristol bs ed where the store manager ahmed offered me the worse treatment i have ever received from any company i asked if i can go inside accompanied by my household persons including me as of us wanted to have new contracts with ee he said no there is only a max although i explained we are from the same household he said no and there were customer assistants inside why would you have employees and only allow clients but i said alright after which he mocked me and asked if i want him to brake the law and allow more than persons in the store at the same time he screamed that we are in a pandemic and there are rules i am as a profession a medical doctor so i know very well what are the risks all of us were wearing face masks for the whole of the conversation after which i stated alright and he kept saying that a colleague of his can assist me from the door while the other person that was before me was able to go into the shop i said that i am not comfortable to speak from the door way doing a contract would have involved probably me giving my personal details which i did not want to do from outside of the shop but ahmed mocked me again and said a rd time this is a pandemic and if i do not like this rules to make sure i inform the government about my views about the rules while the other shop assistant kept laughing and say bye bye to me i asked if i can make a complain about the customer service i received and how he said that ee does not have complain procedure just to call or he can type on my personal phone a number and shouted to me to give him my phone so he can write down the number where i can call to make a he was not afraid anymore of the pandemic rules more than fine to touch my personal phone and write a number he saw fit where i could make a complaint,Bad
3168,the sheer number of negative reviews compared to positive reviews on trustpilot says it all about vodafone people are usually willing to accept that problems occur especially in a business the size of vodafone but when that company almost willfully goes out of its way to change its systems to make itself inaccessible to sort out those problems people get frustrated then they get angry and then they vote with their feet it seems it is impossible to connect to a human being at at present to sort out a problem unless you want to buy something or your problem falls into the limited knowledge base of that lego idiot direction you go in you feel trapped in a kafkaesque circle of hell where you always end up with idiot smiling face asking you for the question he cant answer welcome to we appreciate employing people to deal with everyday problems costs money but if vodafone cant even pay for the slow but at least functioning chat option that just says we dont care about our wont be coming back,Bad
3169,shocking customer service wait on the phone for over an hour if you want to lose the will to live then give them a call i have never known anything as bad as this when it comes to someone answering a phone,Bad

3184,cant get a pac number by texting you have to ring them takes over an hour shocking surely dont allow this,Bad
3185,utterly awful rude disgraceful treatment from every virgin employee i have spoken to repeatedly over many years is it company policy to argue with and talk down to your customers i negotiated a new deal in november and the price has gradually creeped up despite not being told so when the product was sold to me there have been consistent issues with the speed of the internet and outages since i called to raise my concerns and frustrations with being charged more for a service which has got worse all i wanted was the cost to honour what was discussed with the man when the product was sold to me the phone call lasted an hour with them trying to resell me a new package me into another month contract which i repeatedly had told them i didnt want i wanted the price to be altered to match the price that was agreed for the remainder of the existing contract this discussion continued to go around in circles with the man trying to me and not listen i then wanted to escalate it to talk to someone else the manager was not available and we arranged a time to call back it has been day since the agreed call back and still no call i called up again to speak to someone i waited mins in a line got through to someone who was condescending patronising and argumentative i tried to explain the situation and the history of the scenario and he was confrontational and aggressive on every point i made he didnt like that i work in the industry and know what im talking about when it comes to internet speed and usage he ended up hanging up on me when i was mid sentence hanging up on a customer i have literally never experienced such absolutely horrific customer service i literally cant believe i have been a paying customer for so long and will be leaving as soon as humanly virgin,Bad

3193,these jokers are absolutely incompetent after one of their many blunders they decided to give away our line despite writing to us and asking us which we has meant getting new wifi is next to impossible at the same speeds we used to have and with two people working from home with video calls etc this is incredibly lost hours and hours trying to resolve this issue and despite two of us having loss of earnings from not working they offered a laughable customer good will payment of and the only solution they offered us was a complete breach of data protection and a doubt the very worst experience ive ever had with any company,Bad
3194,i was on the chat line for hours and minutes to get a simple answer to my query this eventually after a lot of lost patience proved to be unacceptable for goodness sake speed up your connection or your operators,Bad
3195,in march i received an email that they are going to send me a brand new wifi hub after few weeks i received an email from that my order has been delivered i spoke with customer support and she told me they sent the package to the wrong address their fault and that they will send it again to my correct address few days later i received an email that they have canceled my i cant find any way to contact them online chat email phone emails are from their customer support but at the end of this email is do not reply note link to online chat doest customer support,Bad
3196,why should i join these are a few of finest and unique slow internet worst customer service network extremely bad bars download speed low without reason minutes disappearing text messages failing to send,Bad
3197,they promise speeds which they cannot possibly do not listen to their customers they are not committed to customer used to recommend bt to my friends but because of recent dropouts poor service poor help i cannot and will not recommend bt anymore,Bad
3198,phoned on behalf of my parents as broadband keeps kicking us off continually having to reconnect two weeks ago the lady assured me she had given them a great deal fibre broadband and a new router for a month imagine when i arrived at their house today to read all the your new bill a month add one included talk talk tv call boost and call divert i think not phoned today to be told a new router is and looks like there is not fibre in our area so theyre sending open reach out to check meanwhile they have no internet at all now the st person i spoke to is no more than a scammer boosting her commission i think after tomorrow it will be cancelling talk talk altogether disgusted,Bad
3199,i thought they had improved as a company what a load of crap their tv is not user friendly and very hard to use plus you cant get to talk to anyone i cancel direct debit disconnected everything go back to preview and ordered myself a stay away at all cost,Bad
3200,a couple of months ago i was in the process of leaving talk talk when they convinced me to go with a new contract of a singing and dancing broadband package fast fibre using eero all set up by outreach engineers months in no internet am straight out of hospital no internet no tv bored put of my mind to be told it could be up to days for initial contact so angry frustrated and upset i know there is life without tv but am currently housebound on crutches and there us no plan for when rhe sees patter is a believe everything you are told they lie,Bad
3201,i spent quite a while deciding which company to take out a contract with for my new phone i chose o i made a big mistake dont use them two months after taking home my brand new phone it stopped working the fault no one could hear me speak at their end of the phone what are phones for to make calls most basic before the games the texts the apps they are for speaking to people so if people cant hear you what is the point i took the phone to my nearest store i expected an immediate replacement but was told it had to go for repair leaving me without a smart phone for a week the engineers are as useless as the customer service since it came back saying no fault detected so we have not repaired it and guess what it still has the same fault so after minutes on the stupid live chat line with a guy who cant manage much more but to tell me he is sorry for my trouble i am no where what kind of retailer sells dud items and doesnt replace them immediately when they are returned faulty sure it is not unlikely that a product will have a fault that is obvious but it is the way the matter is handled that makes customer service good acceptable or appalling so now i have to trail along to the store again have it sent off again wait another week for what it to come back unrepaired once more and this can happen three times before they give me a new phone o never again,Bad
3202,ee sent me a text message saying i must get a new plan by th september by clicking on a link this link was not effective as it ends up in a dead end so i went onto the website and this is also so confusing and it just forces you to either upgrade or to buy a new plan instead of just amending you plan so i ended up with a new plan which i dont need at all and didnt manage to obtain a new plan to replace my existing one at all,Bad
3203,this company is appalling the customer service must be the worst i have ever come across in my fail to rectify problems do not contact you at arranged times i have actually asked if they have an obnoxious training program for the staff as they are the rudest cs agents i have ever come across have been experiencing constant broadband dropouts and they insist there is no problem with the service the router cannot connect to a tv that is not even ft away as apparently it is a range issue also has trouble connecting to a tv thats ft away asked for a pac code to take my mobile to another supplier and spent nearly an hour on the phone with a member of retention team who blatantly lied to me promising to change a new contract price and duration which turned out to be a total pack of lies all in all a very disappointing experience and not handled at all well by the cs or even by the supposed directors office apparently you can email the ceo and they are happy to provide an email address but he will ot read or respond its done by the same inept incompetent agents who have there hands tied behind there backs there is nothing in there remit that is actually of any benefit to the customer they ask what they can do to rectify the situation but every avenue that could help is blocked by there protocols and nobody else above is available to discuss it advice is stay away from this company,Bad
3204,just called talk talk to use my phone abroad very rude woman telling me i am not the account holder and then hung up on me i was not rude to her in any way i hope you recorded that call as something your stuff should not be doing did call back and gave a man the same information and he delt with it fine,Bad
3205,not great over the last few months internet keeps dropping out for a few mins multiple times a day worse in the evenings a neighbor it consultant having the same issues will probably go elsewhere when contract expires in september,Bad
3206,expensive for what it is unreliable equipment and unprofessional pig ignorant through to them is literally impossible live chat takes hours between responses phones leave you on hold for up to two hours and even then they sometimes put the phone down on you emails letters are completely ignored if you do get through to their dreadful offshore call centre the staff can barely speak english i was speaking about my broadband dropping out she was babbling on about my bill that i hadnt even mentioned they really are a joke and a bad one at that never ever again will i use them after my contract expires i shall dump them asap like ive just done with virgin mobile which is just as bad,Bad
3207,shocking service really was on the phone for an hour trying to leave and was passed around different departments before being hung up on the online chat isnt much better had to wait hours to connect to the cancellation team with no response,Bad
3208,very bad customer happy at all waiting for manager call for days most of staff not trained at all time waster,Bad
3209,no internet wifi connection for days the service used to crash often but this time its taking the complete liberty its been down since the th of july birmingham apparently an outage at virgin media who knows maybe just a well planned internet service way im completely disappointed with virgin medias ghost internet service ive check online and it seems to have happened all over the uk with london hit happened a cyber hack attack or a genuine outage virgin media please respond im sure youll be losing your million plus customers very soon and your stock shares will they reply well looking at the other comments it really seems like they dont give a hit,Bad
3210,sent me the incorrect phone following an upgrade instead of just swapping it you have to return it to them wait up to days for a refund and then go through the whole process again which includes them trying to sell you options you dont need sort your processes out to make them customer focussed not just easy for you,Bad
3211,worst customer service ever i just bought a for instant use in germany when i bought it no one told me that the rules printed on the package had changed online registration is out of a sudden not possible anymore so they provided a phone number to do that waited and waited in line only to be told that registration over the phone is not possible anymore either and that i would have to go and find a shop in this strange city all the while i am on a super tight schedule i started to complain that they should inform customers when their terms of use change but the very bored unmotivated lady on the phone just hung up i wasnt very polite i admit but i was not unfriendly either just complaining in a formal even if serious tone about their lack of transparency horrible company how little do they pay to these poor people in the that they are so unprofessional horrible i better look to pay a bit more in order to have a more humane company if that is possible in the mobile phone world i really cant wrap my head around the low ethical standard and resulting,Bad
3212,the end is near for ee as well they used to be amazing but in the last years theyve gone down the hill this companies grow and grow and become more and more popular and then forgot why they got so popular because they were doing something well and they lose their focus from customers to services less and less coverage it seems and their prices are from a different planet it seems,Bad
3213,i have been trying to cancel my contract with virgin basically because they have broken the contract i have with them by disconnecting my phone for days i have tried calling several times and i am always told by the person on the line that they cannot cancel my contract the only quick response i have received from virgin is from my previous review so please read this and cancel my contract thank you,Bad
3214,awful i have waited weeks for my wifi box to come to be told a day after it was meant to go live that there is a problem somewhere else and i need to wait for an engineer to come to fix it i have had no offer of a refund due to me not being able to use my wifi and having to pay for extra data could this problem not have been resolved before my wifi was meant to go live so it could be ready when i was told not only this but the chat service does not work correctly and i had to keep restarting it therefore answering the same questions again and again as it would not let me type overall i am no to happy at all still no wifi and no idea of when we will have some probably another weeks,Bad
3215,bt does not seem to care about losing their customers i am being charged per month for a full fiber in a months contact already in for half term gb when for new customers they charge per month for the same broadband same speed same everything i have spoke to their loyalty team today who they of course cannot offer me a better deal yet until months about to finish the contract even though i have been their customer for the past years considering their terms and conditions i should not pay any cancellation fee because their charge has changed in a way that severly disadvantages me compared to new customers loyalty team insists that i will have to pay that exit fee anyway not sure how legal or legit this fee is considering the consumer protection act and the huge disadvantage to new customers i will certainly dig further into this i told them i am switching to another supplier because whatever early fee they may charge i will recover it back by switching after a and a half but they did not seem to care or even try to offer me a better deal i have raised a complaint about it and they have advised they will contact me in days let see what happens this might be the last payment they will get from me and i will recommend my family who is coming to live in the uk from august to use another supplier and of course share this with my followers on social media so that they can hopefully make a better decision when choosing a broadband supplier,Bad
3216,thanks for such positive feedback best,Bad
3217,requires you to jump through many hoops to cancel and impossible to get through,Bad
3218,talk talk password reset site is useless currently down,Bad
3219,without a phone line for days and called over times kept saying its been fixed engineer visits have been cancelled and still without a phone line i would not recommend virgin media at all customer service rude and your update of course we checked if there was an outage on the app as your phone lines are so slow honestly drive a person to drink terrible customer service,Bad
3220,worst internet ive ever had cant get signal outside my front room cant wait another provider reaches my house,Bad
3221,if i could give less star i would been ongoing dropping of broadband for weeks engineer was suppose to come out but bt didnt register it with the engineer then had to wait another days for their error hour on the phone mini hub not working which they wont replace and told to buy a new charger even though its there kit refused to put me through to manager or give his full name well bt its bye from me and over to vodafone at tenner less per month and a dingle provided for if any problems our vodafone dingle husband uses was going faster than bt and more reliable,Bad
3222,i asked via the talktalk chat room what is call divert i did not get an answer,Bad
3223,why is virgin so crap cant even get on to my email to check them they charge the earth for crap service,Bad
3224,shocking customer service no one seems to know what they are doing when you phone up i set up a direct debit when i took out my phone contract but still had to pay over the phone if it wasnt for my daughter sorting it out for mei would still be paying over the phone even thou i had set up a direct debit and as for the broadband its pretty shocking for going down,Bad
3225,i had a service provision failure customer service zero stars systems procedures zero stars trying to resolve a simple line glitch was a disaster took weeks to fix i complained they never phoned twice when they said they would i txt them said i would no longer talk to them but a written apology would be good so now deal with me by email or letter they refused to do that kept phoning they also failed to pay compensation for service loss etc within their own day time window i took both matters up with whom they subscribe to talktalk agreed with that they would upload a written pdf apology compo within working days they failed to do either within their own time limit again so i reverted to talktalk agreed yet again to do both within days which on the th day they did comply btw the apology pdf was a blank word document with non specific generic copy pasted paras there was no letter heading references contact details date name or signage this underlines how they treat their customers with contempt will be off when my contract expires avoid this company as if you have a service hick up you will need to suffer their incompetence the reply from tt below just underlines their attitude incompetence i detailed above in my review what exactly was wrong with the letter but they dont see an issue with that,Bad
3226,i will never get a phone from vodafone ever again absolute scammers told me one price on the phone last week then this week put it up by another and when i got the contract i was told i was allowed free upgrade each year now they are charging me to do so absolute joke of a company worst phone company in the market atm if you want to waste your money by all means use them if not dont,Bad
3227,i have been a customer of virgin media for eight years and have seen their customer service dwindle to the point it is now abysmal if you are trying to solve anything then you are put through to a call centre in the philippines where staff dont seem to have been trained in what to do and say they are solving problems but nothing is done trying to cancel my contract took two days and six phone calls if i wasnt sure about leaving them before i am now,Bad
3228,weeks of phone calls to manage a move i work from home i still have no internet and these highly unqualified call centres keep messing up getting this sorted non stop empty promises absolutely useless,Bad
3229,before i joined talktalk i had heard the stories about how bad customer service was but i thought what can go wrong and signed my word they really are they are awful they cant do anything correct they cant fix ever think of joining talktalk they cannot be trusted,Bad
3230,i have been with o since mobiles were invented i bought a new phone weeks ago and signed up for a new contract within a couple of days it was obvious that there were problems with the phones battery as it was completely loosing its charge within the course of a day even when i wasnt using it i took it back into the store and advised them of the situation and was told that it needed to go onto stamina mode and this would stop the problem after i recharged it i was leaving for france the next day and needed the phone whilst away on the way to folkestone the phone packed up completely couldnt get it on whatever i did i tried to call the cross street store in manchester on a friends phone or times on the way down but no one in the store ever answers their phone and if you leave it ringing it eventually just cuts out i had no phone all the time i was away weeks and had to use friends to pass messages home tried ringing the store again and again when back in the uk but still no answer i took the phone back into the store today to be told that they cannot replace it as i am outside the days returns limit despite me having returned the phone originally just a couple of days after buying it tried ringing customer services to be told repeatedly on a recorded message that they are receiving a high number of calls and cannot take mine take my advice do not deal with this company and if you already have and then have a problem with your phone within the first days insist on a replacement but because if you take their word that they have fixed it and walk away you wont get a replacement if you take it back,Bad
3231,i ordered a new phone with vodafone which arrived last saturday th june took the phone out of the box and tried to switch it on and nothing tried to charge it and nothing called their customer services and explained i could not switch on the phone the first question they asked me was is this the phone you are calling from after an hour on the phone they finally admitted the handset must be faulty and told me to call back tomorrow to arrange an exchange i called back and was told the phone was out of stock and to call back days later im still waiting and the phone is still out of stock even though it is readily available from all local stores but they will not allow me to exchange in a shop as it will affect their sales i been paying for weeks and still no phone no callback no one gives a toss,Bad
3232,complete rubbish wouldnt touch em again with a,Bad
3233,received message online that internet services not working intermittent problems over days that were fixed and then in the second instance was told that they would send an engineer but i would have to pay costs if the fault was internal had no alternative but to agree but under protest as this seemed like black mail engineer did not turn up as arranged and had to phone again all in all took days to fix i complained and was offered compensation firstly a months rental then months then vat after several calls and referrals to management i asked for the failed appointment fee of that bt charge to be added but was offered a said to be the standard fee finally referred to the complaint review service who agreed to add the vat hardly pays for the lost and wasted time but have accepted in full and final settlement i have reported the process to the ceo as this is quite pathetic,Bad
3234,i have ordered with been days and i still havent received them this is not even international posting this is local update and no way to check,Bad
3235,im years old and ive come up against bad service in my time but nothing comes close to vodafone if they give you freebie minutes every single one is charged for noone on live chat reads or believes a word you say on the rare times its available noone replies on facebook on the paid help line they cut you off after your min wait or say theyll call you back and never do avoid at all costs dont even consider it,Bad
3236,never ever again will i decide to go with bt nothing but endless issues we had phone and broadband fitted in may and it did not work at all we had different engineers out and the last engineer said they fixed it she literally left i tried to get onto the wifi and it did not work after multiple calls to bt they decided to close my account in july well we are now in october and my account is still not closed i keep having bills sent to me i have rang them in july august and september to close my account as im no longer using their services and still this has not been done ive had my time wasted in ringing a company i am no longer with just to easily close my account but im still getting billed to this day i just phoned them and they told me i have to ring back tomorrow absolute joke as customer rights i feel as if i should have some compensation off bt for the amount of times i have had to call them for them to just do their jobs what they are paid to do,Bad
3237,along with many others virgin transferred my two phones to but only one got there in the end i had to be issued a new sim card i complained to both companies but neither came up with a reply now both phones are on o but they only managed one direct debit more calls terrible customer service will be changing suppliers o never seem to listen stay away is my advice,Bad
3238,i have a gigabyte package and i dont get the promised speed,Bad
3239,the service drops out too often and talk talk fraudulently signed me up and charged me for a tv service that i hadnt ordered i was promised a refund on my next bill which hasnt happened and im having to spend another hour on the phone trying to sort it will leave this service as soon as i possibly can,Bad
3240,can i not give less than one star wish id read the reviews before i signed up havent even had the install month down the line and ive already had enough of them customer service is a disgrace call centres are clearly thousands of miles away and they couldnt care less communication is non existent went to complain and not surprisingly the online complaint form isnt available they make sky and bt look good,Bad
3241,poor broadband poor support and,Bad
3242,awful customer service been waiting for a call back for working days being passed onto different told no one has left notes on my making false promises to the worse deal when i have been a customer for connection does not even work in most phone provider ever worse mistake ever made,Bad
3243,very frustrating experience dealing with customer services on the phonei was being charged for addons i didnt have and they didnt show up on my app but customer services refused to believe staff from the ee shop could confirm this ee only received a partial refund even though it was clearly an ee very error prone so be careful and go to the ee shop rather than phone for help the staff in the shops are very helpful,Bad
3244,nightmare after the death of my husband i cancelled his account and tried to start one of my own there has been mistakes after mistakes finally yesterday my a account was shown on the internet finally correct today it is not there just the old one again so far i have done chats over the past week and several hours battling with phone calls,Bad
3245,no thanks for leading me onto ee currently a difficult service to anything through and your accountability is required by me ie to a reliable service,Bad
3246,its been months and we still dont have working internet and the engineer keeps being rescheduled the customer support is nonexistent during lockdown and pandemic that is simply an unacceptable level of upon conferring further with the talktalk reps they said that the order was cancelled in their system at the time of the review recently because of a technical error so our best solution is to reorder they charged us money and wait another days to get everything sorted excuse me but wt this is shockingly abysmal even for talktalk if i could give or negative stars i would,Bad
3247,i am with o since and coz of unpaid bill of they disconnect my phone without a msg or email this is what you get for being loyal one thing is for sure the moment my contract ends with o i am switching to some other network provider,Bad
3248,terrible couldnt resolve my issues via their website took days to contact them via when you do get through they say you have dealt with your query they havent i left them months ago when my contract am with another provider having moved my number however i am still being charged what for exactly pathetic and i have just this morning received a letter from them telling me they have suspended my account because i havent paid wrong i am not with you would i continue paying,Bad
3249,great stuff,Bad
3250,i signed up for business broadband in february i was completely aware that my premises did not have an existing line so would need to install the line i lost count of the number of engineers that called out i would estimate around everytime nothing was done and then i would receive an email from talktalk telling me a new appointment was scheduled in august an engineer again called to my premises and without installing the line into my premises and according to talktalk he signed the job off at this stage i still did not have any physical line or socket in my premises but talktalk started billing me for a service i wasnt receiving i spoke to approximately different customer service representatives from talktalk and tried everytime to explain i didnt have a line or socket and kept repeating i should not be billed everytime they talked over me ignored what i was telling them and told me i had a working line as had signed this off they stated i was without my fiber broadband so they were not billing me for this service untill resolved this issue fast forward to days ago a very helpful engineer called out the best of a very bad bunch he hooked the line from a telegraph pole to my premises brought a new line in connected a socket and got it connected to the exchange thankfully now months after signing up i got i rang talktalk again yesterday to try and explain again that up untill two days ago it was impossible for me to have an active line and therefore i should never have been billed again i was passed about cold transferred from agent to agent and having to repeat myself and still no admission i was without an active line also when i signed up i was on a fiber promotion for months reducing my bill by a month an agent from talktalk quoted my total bill without this discount when i asked what i would be charged going everytime i finish a call with someone from talktalk i get an email stating my problem has been resolved and asking me to rate the customer service i thinks its ridiculous that my calls are deemed resolved when they are far from resolved and im sure the employees are on some performance target system that make them interested in only closing your as fast as possible service is disgraceful and i will be doing my best to cancel my contract as i feel it should be within my rights as my service is only active two harkin,Bad
3251,put a star a while ago and it for taken down seems they have a high score because of this signed up months ago they had an issue with the line and said they would come back not heard from them since march no update nothing have wrote to them to cancel and wont be using them again,Bad
3252,i really wish i could give virgin media minus stars for all the grief they have caused me these past months ive had terrible wifi which led me to call customer service time and again but with no result they kept saying it all looks fine from their end it was as if i was making it all up i have switched to sky and finally i have a good connection with no issues at all i packed up their equipment sent it back but im still getting emails saying they are going to charge me as they havent recieved it the irony was when i called them back to tell them i have sent it the lady at customer services says oh but i just checked the phone calls you made to us and if you had called more and complained properly we would have resolved the problem can you imagine,Bad
3253,rubbish company still waiting for my refund never again,Bad
3254,it would seem that having such a monopoly in the industry means that they simply do not have to care about their customers or customer service in any way i dont think ive ever met anyone who hasnt had a terrible experience with bt literally hours infact probably amounting to days of time lost spent on the phone being transferred around all kinds of departments and people most of whom are based in a call center in india or some such nobody taking any ownership to try and resolve a genuine problem lies broken promises terrible service rudeness endless holding i could go on and on but i get the feeling that anyone reading this review will already know from previous experience that bt are simply the worst company on the planet i would say avoid at all costs but that seems to be easier said than done i own a small business and i know that if i treated my customers in any way like bt treat theirs then i would be out of business within months horrendous in every way,Bad
3255,absolutely atrocious promised a minimum of mbps and only received less than mbps mbps to be exact during the first them over the phone they said it was due to router software requiring upgrade speed still slow after week later then they said it was a faulty router sent a new one and speed was still slow was put through their manager who gave me a boost in speed and said i will be given compensation for the slow speed over the past week in speed still less than finally limped to mbps contacted them again they promised that things have been escalated to higher ranking managers and will be contacted within hours its now the th week and they still have not having to go through poor who had to receive the brunt of customers frustrations and on last contact they said i can request for compensation as compared to i will be given compensation as discussed with their over the phone this compensation was confirmed and promised on different occasions with different what a joke stay away from worth saving a few bloody bucks for atrocious service better off going to virgin or sky talktalk i have gone to your helpsupport page numerous times and got no solutions its always our managers are currently on your case and will contact you given template answers and not solving any problem just like your help support,Bad
3256,where do i start the internet service totally unreliable no error reports and nobody seems to know what is going on when the service is down customer service spent hour trying to have the service disconnected was passed around to people that could not help and was only given sales pitches finally was transferred to someone that could help but also then went into sales mode finally got the account closed the customer service is in india or somewhere like that and i could not understand what they were saying their english was terrible virgin as a company this company used to be great i have been with them before they became virgin in things have changed the internet is terrible and customer service is worse than star i am glad i made the decision to leave if i could give no stars i would,Bad
3257,i wish i could give this company stars i would not treat a dog the way they have treated me they have zero respect for peoples time or money and are out to get as much money as possible from people they make it extremely difficult to change anything the chat line is basically pointless because all they do is tell you to call which takes hours so if you have a job as most people do do not take a contract out with this company you wont have time to fix anything you are unhappy with,Bad
3258,to expensive looking into a nother,Bad
3259,im traveling abroad and needed to get a new sim and basic plan i went into ee and topped up for only to find out several hours later that my account had somehow not been credited i tried to go to the store the next day to sort it out but theyre closed saturday i tried calling customer service but it costs to talk with a human which i cant do because my account has no fing credit this enterprise is borderline criminal do not use,Bad
3260,absolutely disgusted with this company tryed to fone cancel it they refused to do so after hours of arguing on fone they agreed to cancel with a fee of was cancelling because there monthly payments had become ridiculous managed to get payment down a bit but only lasted months then it was back up to what i had been paying been a loyal customer for over years stay away from this company,Bad
3261,i applied for virgin tv broadband the order number and was told to wait while they would credit check it took days to credit check me because they had a back log according to them then they say my application is declined because i have adverse credit my credit file is fine i checked equifax call credit etc nothing on their all my bills are paid on direct debit and never had any issues after calling them on so many times and speaking to call centres in mars pluto the black hole and were ever else they are i phoned bt was accepted straight away virgin are a waste of time,Bad
3262,talktalk do not understand the meaning of the word service it really needs to be seen to be believed if you have an issue with broadband or telephone performance you are in for a battle with their offshore organisation to get any problem resolved my latest issue was being charged for an engineer fix which was due to damage at a telegraph pole and no signal to my house it really is appalling i will be taking my latest complaint to the ombudsman to get a refund i will be seeking an alternative provider at earliest,Bad
3263,i have a free sim card from o just wanted to check if their signal is better now i am bombarded with marketing calls and texts everyday i am sick and tired of it they have a lost a possible future customer,Bad
3264,a couple of months ago i was in the process of leaving talk talk when they convinced me to go with a new contract of a singing and dancing broadband package fast fibre using eero all set up by outreach engineers months in no internet am straight out of hospital no internet no tv bored put of my mind to be told it could be up to days for initial contact so angry frustrated and upset i know there is life without tv but am currently housebound on crutches and there us no plan for when rhe sees patter is a believe everything you are told they lie,Bad
3265,my name is dylan area code i am paying for m start off with how disgusting and non helpful this company is they clearly have shown that they dont care about me over and over making excuses which initially i was accused of lying through out this process until it was confirmed via the phone call i was on with the guy who offered me the upgrade that he indeed mislead me and i was correct firstly i was promised a free sim with my broadband upgrade being a year customer and they want to mess me never got the sim i had to get the phone call evidence when i got the file it was encrypted it said the code was sent to my number which it never did i called and complained about it its been months i have been without my bloody sim i have been played about with and bribed by the virgin media agents offering more crappy offers as if i am stupid to get another offer as if they didnt just screw me over i have been waiting for so long i am sick and tired because when i was offered the upgrade i was lied to this was then confirmed by virgin media and they are processing my free included sim ahah its been over a month i know theyre not doing anything about it i cancelled my old sim provider because i was promised one with my upgraded broadband package never happened and i have been without a sim for this whole time i refuse to pay for a separate sim in the meantime i have been mislead and mistreated i want my contract terminated with out fees i am also starting to think that my upgrade was a temporary discount temporarily which i specifically asked many time on the phone call about my pricing staying the same through out the whole contract and was told it will remain at,Bad
3266,terrible service broadband and value,Bad
3267,i got cold called by this company today supposedly on behalf of vodafone also quoting my companys name the male who called had to tell me some really important information after me already telling him twice that i wasnt interested in what he was selling me and that i had to go i was in the vets at the time with my dog and for all he knew she was getting put down but was still adamant he had to tell me this information despite me telling him this,Bad

3274,note do not make it easy to contact them either by phone email or webchat their customer service if you could call it that is mse bf bundle and received sim twice on against my uk credit card ending refs and received email that my payment of dkk had failed danish krona yet theyd already charged me after a long wait for the phone to be answered raised problem with currency issue and given a ref received email same day telling me issue had been resolved received another email telling me payment of dkk had failed danish checking my online account i noticed that the credit card recorded ended ive never had a card of any sort ending with that number this is why the debit had failed so where did they get the card number to add my correct credit card to my account but the website repeatedly refused to accept my details with a long failure reference tried phoning on several days but after long wait gave up finally on again after long wait finally answered and the i repeated my issue with all the details as stated above then the operator said she couldnt handle the problem couldnt see on my account where i had been charged and abruptly transferred me to another number after waiting for an hour and a half for the ringing to be answered i gave up my problem is still ongoing and unresolved i thought i was getting a reasonable mobile phone deal for the first months but it has turned out to be a very frustrating time with a lot of wasted time and effort on their website and the phone trying to get my problem resolved during the latest phone call i was advised they were having problems with their website has this been a problem since the beginning of january i dont think so whilst the financial cost has been a minimum i would have expected a better service than say on their website they have over m satisfied customers worldwide but they dont say how many billions are i want is to correct my credit card details charge me the correct amount and give me the benefits of the contract ive entered into with them also provide an easily accessible much much better customer i want to know why my credit keeps reducing when i havent used the phone im beginning to think this is a scam company as they do not answer when on their web chat after typing in live agent waited for an hour and no answer fortunately i havent transferred my old number yet so i still have access to a phone,Bad
3275,disgusted with virgin media my renewal package is on the th of each month on th june i got a text advising that i had used of my data allowance and could purchase an add on i checked to see how much this would cost which was and how much per day i would be charged if i went over which was per day i would therefore expect to pay less if i opted for the daily charges as days left before the renewed allowance kicked in on th i checked my allowance and was told that i still had mb and i ran out of credit later that day i checked later that day to ensure that i was only charged but was told that i owed i called up to query why and was told that i ran out on the th i said the system told me that i had credit even that morning and queried why it was saying that when it was supposed to update every minutes he said that if there were any erroneous charges they would be adjusted before the bill went out th i get the bill with extra charges rather than the i was expecting i spent minutes to someone who clearly was not listening and offered me off only in the end i stated that i was still being overcharged and wanted to take this forward as a complaint she gave me a complaint reference and said that i would hear from them by letter in days today i phoned up as still no letter and get told that as i had accepted off the complaint had been closed if they listened to the recording i never accepted the offer she chose to deduct the amount from the bill and the call ended with her confirming that the complaint was being taken forward needless to say that i am livid the person today has been notified by me that i want the matter referred to the ombudsman what is most concerning is that none of the three people have given the slightest worry that for three days i was running up charges when told that i still have credit the automated system is supposed to be updated every minutes and therefore there is a serious issue with the system i wonder how many others have experienced extra charges virgin media are obviously not concerned at all about what i deem as nothing more than fraud of their customers i have been a loyal customer for years but that may well change if i dont get a resolution i know the extra that i have had to pay after the reduction is not a lot but it is not only the principle but they have overcharged for days if i have been told that i have credit by their system when they have said to me when i called them to complain that i didnt they need to look into it rather than just me off also i was told that i can expect the letter confirming referral to the ombudsman within days why so long just to do that part i will not be going away if that is what they hope apart from to take my custom elsewhere,Bad
3276,we are in the middle of a line move since weeks the dates of the solution and fixing is keep postponed i just got empty words over the phone from the technical support and from the customer service too i am fed up i wouldnt choose them again never the best part the engineer ruined our old broadband from a supplier and they just dont care about it noone takes any responsibility so now i need to pay broadband and got nothing thanks for being incompetent and miserable dear talktalk nothing happened again just another appointment has been postponed this is not service it is the th of nov no broadband for almost months bit they still want me to pay for nothing such a dilettante company,Bad
3277,every time i buy a new mb day add on it apparently runs out after four days its meant to last thirty days i dont understand why my credit runs out that fast it isnt right im thinking of joining a different network they seem to be taking me for a fool,Bad
3278,wow that was the worst customer service ever experienced so rude and unhelpful,Bad
3279,was on hold to visit service for an they refused to help or offer any blaming the layout of my bedroom flat for poor i contacted the complaints department weeks ago and it was more of the what you want from this but it seems virgin are only interested in registering new customers offering a poor service and then expecting the customer to pay more to improve on the already poor service,Bad
3280,absolutely terrible service silly me didnt read all of these reviews and took out a landline and broadband contract with bt on the th of october which was supposed to be up and running on th october for some reason they cancelled my order after a few days and then placed the order again and told me everything would go live on the th of october which ofcourse i was not happy about but hey what could i do so i waited on the th for some reason my landline was switched on so i thought great maybe my broadband will be active too but no someone in india informed me they cancelled that again bt reordered my broadband and told me it would go live on th of november which is most deff not acceptable after my call being pushed around several departments i finally managed to cancel with them i strongly advise you to avoid,Bad
3281,at first it seems like a great deal and the first few weeks were good now if phones go on wifi at the same time our broadband dies but they keep telling me theyre not limiting it and that its our lines wasnt like that with you bother theyre service too many times they get rude and just end the chat saying nothing else they can do unless i want to pay for extra equipment dont get suckered in by cheap prices them and their services really suck,Bad
3282,awful company i recently missed a payment due to a change of circumstances i tried to contact them to tell them i cannot pay until a specific date but i was just told sorry well have to disconnect your phone cant you pay sooner despite saying i cannot afford to theyve now cut off my phone completely disgusting company not considerate at all especially to the current cost of living crisis they harass you none stop phone calls when you miss a payment not helpful when youre at work funny how when you miss a payment they disconnect you and harass you but when your phone has had poor data connection and phone calls constantly cut out they dont want to know or help you at all,Bad
3283,my engineer was supposed to arrive between and he arrived after pm i had to call the office several times to check whats going on or if hes even going to show up every time i just got a random time like he will be there is half an hour that seemed like they just made it up they could have let me know what was going on without me having to call so many times the engineer once he arrived was and helpful his name was working in acton town area perhaps worst of all the problem was that virgins subcontractor kellys just disconnected our internet cutting the cable under the ground for no reason we have seen their van outside our house doing works the same time the signal disappeared we waited days without internet for it to be connected back again and it was extremely difficult to find on the website where to book an appointment,Bad
3284,i cancelled my contract with virgin media in dec and was told they would take my final direct debit and me if necessary i had to wait weeks and then they would send me a cheque in the post by royal mail i rang on th feb to be told by an arrogant customer services lady that they had until the th to send me a cheque and then i have to wait days for it to be delivered i waiting until th and rang again to be told it had been posted on the th when i was told it hadnt been processed i was informed to wait to see if it would be delivered i waited until th and spoke to a lady who informed me she would get back to me surprise surprise no return call i contacted again on th and asked to speak to a manager to be told i couldnt so i asked for the complaints procedure to be told they didnt have one i was then put on hold for over mins so rang again on my husbands phone and was put straight through to a manager who told me that i would have to wait another days for another cheque to be processed and posted by royal mail he promised he would ring me back the following day and guess what no return phone call so i phoned again each time i have to go through the whole story again no one knows what the other person is doing and it is very apparent that they do not keep records of conversations or concerns otherwise i wouldnt have been able to be on lines at the same time without the nd person realising i will never return to virgin as their customer service is and i would recommend every one else do the same,Bad
3285,this has happened times now over years local area fault you look up the area fault reports none you run through all the various complex and time consuming setups eventually rebooting the router and losing all your passwords etc still doesnt work so you call the helpline the final choice and hear the recorded message telling you there is a problem in your area wont bother with any of the really clever help manoeuvres go straight to call centre in future why cant they just update the local area check would have saved an hour of my life tonight,Bad
3286,my broadband is slow im thinking about swapping to another company,Bad
3287,the chat service for talk talk was one of the most frustrating experiences i have ever had i have put one star but if there was a zero star i would have selected that instead the call took over one hour i asked questions over and over to get an answer which should have taken no more than mins the responses were inordinately slow and repeatedly did not answer my questions the end of the shat was surreal the agent told me that the offer we had taken an hour to establish was not available because i didnt accept it despite my having accepted it numerous times by the end of the chat i was completely unclear as to what contract i then had with talk talk however by the i had lost the will to live this was definitely the worst customer service experience i have had in my entire lifetime,Bad
3288,id been with this company for over years and when i had an audit on my charges i found i was paying four times the price i needed to after years of being with them i thought i would be ok to leave and use another company but oh no they wanted to charge me to get out of my contract fortunately the new company pointed out that they dont keep copies of call recordings nor do they keep copies of paper contracts so unless they were able to produce a copy they wouldnt be able to hold me to any contract and guess what after hours of talks they eventually admitted that they have no record of either a written or verbal contract as they dont keep them so they couldnt charge me any cancellation charges nice try though i wonder how many people would just pay it,Bad
3289,totally useless ask a slightly technical question you are disconnected user arvind,Bad
3290,do not even think to get any product this disgusting company,Bad
3291,i cancelled my account well over weeks ago as i moved into a property that already had internet so it wasnt required they have continued to bill me despite this and no longer living in the property or using their service ive called a number of times to resolve it but the closest answer ive had is to pay the bills which talktalk will then refund no chance mate how about you lot actually cancel my account,Bad
3292,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
3293,by far the worst company ive ever dealt with embarrassing,Bad
3294,i have recently bought a new apple watch and needed them to change the contract from my current apple watch to new one wait time to answer was to m waited for m when i finally got through was passed to somebody who did the change and told me it would be done between to hrs hrs later nothing so called again spoke to the person there who told me the previous agent had gotten it all wrong and told me to go through a different process which sounded odd but she assured me would solve the problem followed instructions as requested and suddenly my phone stopped working called again via my landline and finally spoke to somebody who seemed to know what he was talking about he informed me that both the previous people i had spoken to had given me the wrong instructions and that the last one had managed to erase the sim and that he could not fix it on the phone but i would need a new sim for the phone before they can look to deal with the watch switch as he could only send me the card via mail i decided to pick up a sim myself next am in a vodafone shop he said he had booked a call for me at with all the notes so they would be able to call me and sort out the problem once i had the sim again he told to make sure the agent at the shop read the notes so they would know what to give me and he told me i needed a new sim which they should link to the account but not activate again told the agent who told me that was not possible and she would put a new sim and activate so she did and phone seem to at least work again i went home and when i tested the phone at home saw that i now had a new number not my mbl number so back to shop she clearly did not know why that had happened and told me the only thing she could do was give me a blank sim and that when i was called back they would be able to sort it out so i headed back home again to wait for the call finally got a call late and agent is trying to get me to do the same process that caused the problem to start still no solution after calls and store visits and half a day spent on the phone with them i have never seen worse tech support for what should have been a simple switch from one apple watch to another and on still on hold so agent now is telling me to do what the other agent specifically told me not to do and send a form that may take hr to switch the number and that i should not worry as we are on the right if not she will escalate it to the second line again never seen any more incompetent group of people who all blame other for the issues and dont take of the problem,Bad
3295,worst worst company ever stealing my money even though i cancelled my contract one after setting it up i am being charged and the worst thing is no one has any information about my account as it has been cancelled everything about this company is slow including internet and customer services the customer services is appalling they have no idea what to do and how to solve issues,Bad
3296,it just the worst experience ive ever had i placed an order to change address as i move from one house to another i did it three times and it was cancelled without any notice or explanation nobody in customer support was able to solve the problem i thought it should be fairly easy,Bad
3297,same old rubbish by the same old rubbish company their customer service is dreadful theyre always happy to take your money and have every excuse under the sun as to why they cant provide what your contract agreement just going to cancel my contract as id rather get a threatening letter than put up with their th rate service any longer,Bad
3298,after using virgin media for years without issue arranging a move and then cancellation was a shockingly poor experience it took me weeks and nearly cumulative hours to arrange a house move finally cancel our broadband service with virgin media here is what went wrong virgins chatbot and text service doesnt work and i work in tech it sends you round in circles and then in theory redirects you to a customer service agent when resetting passwords or memorable words on our online account in order to authenticate our phone conversations with a customer service agent the new data doesnt upload to their server correctly then when you finally speak to phone customer service team who ask for characters of a password what they they should in fact be referring to is the memorable word so we ended up providing the wrong information locking the account for hour they commit to call you hour later and either are late or do not call at all the uk team who then are allowed authorise cancellations or moves have a limited number of staff the outsourced customer service teams in india the philippines or beyond can only log basic requests and no doubt are on the receiving end of the ire of all the frustrated customers when we finally spoke to a human being and negotiated a lower monthly deal the offer then confirmed by email the next morning was by per month my husband and i then spent hour trying to get through to a person to simply cancel it took a further hour to then get through to the cancellation team by this time i had simply arranged broadband with bt which was set up and ready to go in two days virgin customers are not doubt leaving in droves i feel pity for the remaining customer services staff humans who are answering calls to virgin customers their customer service employees will also start leaving in droves the management appears to be purely focused profit they have attempted to increase revenue from price hikes and save costs through poorly designed automation and cutting back on staff yet they have forgotten the basics that customers revenue and employees the to deliver their product if a business does not have customers nor retains employees then price hikes and lower operating costs will not deliver profits virgin have a great broadband product but the shambolic customer experience they have left in place while cutting operating costs simply doesnt work simply put retain your sanity and avoid,Bad
3299,took ages to get connected to broadband still waiting to be up graded to fibre,Bad
3300,currently having the most hideous experience i moved house and paid off everything owed but due to an error on their part it was put on my current property received debt collection letters calls and emails have now paid again to try to put and end to it spoke to numerous members of customer service team who could not find an issue and made me feel and dismissed me i raised numerous complaints which were ignored or i received a reply they have now found the error apologised yet i am still receiving debt collection calls and emails this has been going on since september and im physically sick and having panic attacks they have a process to follow and totally disregard the effect their actions have had on me as a customer and a person department targets are more important than you are,Bad

3304,star based on customer service alone and general service of customers alone based on their actual broadband service its not bad terrible automated phone service which keeps sending a text message and saying bye its not until the third phone call you can speak to someone i asked for wifi pods when i first moved in months ago as the internet didnt reach the outside cameras they ordered them and they never came first time second time i called up and asked where are they and they ordered them again months later ive called for the third time and now they have to complete tests on the line before they send them out ridiculous they greatly advertise free pods if wifi does not work in whole house but that is a farce false advertisement to get customers scam i was with sky before and although they are expensive their service is much better will try to cancel and go back to sky,Bad
3305,charged for the last month on a contract i did not take several phone calls was finally given no of a contract phone which had been taken out by carphone warehouse the t mobile advisor told me i would have to contact them even though this had already been dismissed as a legit contract by t mobile it has taken one month of calls visits to high street branches of ee and carphone warehouse to gt this line disconnected i wasnt even given a sim so how could this happen after being told lots of mis information and both companies refusal to put an info into writing i was eventually told that i would have to contact t mobile direct in writing to cancel direct debit i refused as i had never signed any agreement it took me to blow a and scream down the phone plus a two hour wait on the phone while t mobile and carphone warehouse spoke to each other etc to get the contract cancelled i know have to wait for a refund there us a paper process to a refund department hopefully this will happen i am disabled and suffer with several related conditions i am supposed to avoid stress thank you t mobile,Bad

3308,good product but totally ruined by stealth price hikes and the extreme difficulty to get to discuss this by phone and impossible by email,Bad
3309,the only good thing about talktalk is the telephone service free calls to numbers the rest of talktalk services are absolute broadband is so slow its hardly useable the tv service is hit and miss the set top box remote works when it wants and the recording service is useless the email is rubbish its run by aol i dumped aol years ago because they were rubbish they are no different now its hit and miss as to whether you can get to your emails or not and the platform is rubbish half the time i log in to it says not they use for their mobile service that is also rubbish hardly any coverage round dont have any services they just use the rubbish ones that everyone has dumped in the past,Bad

3315,if you are after customer service then avoid using vodafone the store staff have no power to help with any problem you have with your account and generally give you wrong information and little questions are referred to online customer service which is pretty much non existent as they are only interested in billing you as much as possible even after three visits to the store and calls to their number trying to stop my contract after the two year contract period they still went on billing me then passed my details to a debt collection after they admitted that i had made a genuine mistake when i did not activate my pac code the phone was unused after i told them i was leaving them they still took the money think hard before you are tempted with cheap offers,Bad
3316,i have been trying to activate my sim card for over a year theres no way that i can do it i contacted the support team several time they average time to respond its around working day very cheap company but now i understand why never again,Bad

3322,absolutely shocking service i have to work from home due to the current restrictions that are in place i called over a week ago to report an intermittent fault with the wifi i was told that i needed a new hub which i received a day later after installing the new hub i found there was no internet access at all so i called again and an engineer was sent the following morning he said the hub needed to be activated and it would be up and running later that day the internet started that evening but again it kept going off i called again and the lady i spoke to said i would have to go through all the checks again and the matter would be referred to it i asked to speak to a manager and was put through to an absolutely obnoxious individual he claimed to be a manager but i found out the following day that he had lied he refused to give me his name and when i said i needed it to refer back to him he just said he didnt have to provide his name i asked why and he very rudely said there is no why he then put me on hold or mute until i eventually cut off i have been trying to get the issues with the internet sorted out for days now the last engineer came on monday and said that there is an issue with noise at the main box that needs to be sorted out however i have not been told when this will be fixed and when i have called to chase a date i have been lied to and told i will receive a call which i have never received my work is being affected and i find the delay to resolve the issue unacceptable ironically there were engineers on my street yesterday fitting a cable in for seemingly a new customer yet an ongoing problem cannot be resolved absolutely dreadful service,Bad
3323,absolutley terrible company for placed an order but was not told about all the hidden fees spent over hours trying to cancel my order talks about complaints on webpage but gives nowhere or no email to address complaints to a terrible company do not give them your money,Bad
3324,my mobile phone was transferred from virgin mobile to o however i am the account holder for mobile phones this being my partners this second mobile was not transferred until a month later i agreed a new deal for my mobile at the time of transfer and expected the same deal for my partners mobile when it was eventually this second transfer took place i rang o expecting the same deal they said this was not possible and so i had to take a higher tariff i told them that this was stupid as they should have transferred both mobiles at the same time in my opinion it was another from virgin mobile who were a dreadful company to deal with it would appear o are not a lot better but at least they didnt cut me off,Bad
3325,service has been great then it went off with super fast broadband recently there have been severe outages across the uk at one point we lost virgin for days,Bad
3326,customer service shocking cant describe how bad they are with words transcends language just avoid it for your own sanity at all costs,Bad

3330,been with virgin media for around years from when i log on i cant see my bills or do any interaction as it say i am the secondary account holder and only the account holder can see this information i am the account holder virgin media cant seem to rectify this after literally s of phone calls this is the final will look elsewhere as virgin media cant seem to control their own system or rectify such a simple task at the moment they are trying again and they are now on day and cant seem to rectify very poor customer experience,Bad
3331,incapable company and incompetent customer service they wont even let me cancel my contract and give me my pac codes for my accounts i just get put on hold and transferred to someone else to start again then they say theyll put me on hold again but hang up on me coverage is terrible too unhelpful to say the least so far nearly hours wasted on multiple phone calls but they dont want me to cancel my multiple contracts which i was entitled to leave months ago on one account and over a year ago on the other im basically being held hostage and theres nothing i can do about it,Bad
3332,terrible service installed inner wiring for full fibre nov and said they would be back the next day to complete outside wiring never turned up two days later ive still heard nothing and its impossible to speak to anyone,Bad
3333,as they say from hero to zero disappointed by virgin media broadband after years they no longer want to keep existing customers they plan for is to gain new customers and kick out old customer or offer unbelievable monthly price virgin media quote me a month while i pay very rude customer services they keep you on the line for longer and then pretend they going to help me put you on hold and they offer you such astonishing price of although i told them i want to get the cheapest as the same plan on being at the moment they said yes and then they offer you astonishing price this is a clear message for all customers please leave us we are trying to get a new customers i really dont care about the existing customers,Bad
3334,the worst internet provider i have had and the customer service has been have tried with you fibre for months now as our internet keeps getting cut off or completely cut off i have been on the phone to them numerous times to ask them to fix this issue as we have the most expensive package and i am supposed to work from home every day and its affecting my work its affected it so bad that someone from my work who works in it had to come out to try and troubleshoot my internet we have just been on the phone to them as our internet has completely dropped and the resolution was that all of our wireless devices need wiring up now my mam has and her internet has been fine from day one but for whatever reason ours hasnt but sadly hasnt done much about investigating it and now im in a position waiting for the cancellations team to contact me after bank holiday as there is no one in their call center one word of advise to all of you your internet might be fine now but when you need to reach out to customer services you will be left like we have been for three months,Bad
3335,phoned talktalk loyalty on and spoke with charlotte on call was made at this gets back to the employee as her tone behavior and attitude were absolutely was talked down to and it was made clear that no responsibility was going to be taken while hiding behind technicalities and terms and wanted nothing to do with this as far as she was concerned she believed this to be a and was losing patience and being irritable just to have to explain the situation,Bad
3336,we the customer always have to give a review but never the business my review for com is not a good one quick to get your money but dont follow up and see how the customer is doing just leave you out in the say much more because they did nothing at all terrible service,Bad
3337,one of the very worst experience i had in my entire life i literally had to go through so much from day one when an engineer turned up for activation go live broadband the engineer had no clue what he was doing he told me the service provider was trying do something sneaky and get him to do all the work then he left putting in his report job completed and i shorty received an email from vodafone we have fixed the problem when i was left without internet at home then had to go through all the phone calls and complaints as you all can imagine waiting time and that it was nightmare only within the very few first days and before even having the broadband running for an hour they refused to send an engineer and they instead wanted me to do the job for them very frustrated,Bad
3338,for pound a month for just broadband is already a rip off let alone when it doesnt even work consistently worst company for broadband in my eyes,Bad
3339,the second handset has not charged up after hours and am waiting for some contact from bt for advice,Bad
3340,the person i got through couldnt speak english,Bad
3341,my unlimited data does not stay unlimited it slows right down,Bad
3342,lure you in with good deals then makes it almost impossible to exit contract even if the contract is up not worth it look elsewhere mediocre connection abysmal customer service they lie and then when you bring it up they transfer you to someone else rather than answer your question all i want to do is cancel a rolling contract slightly earlier than planned after being was going to cancel upon moving two phone calls and four days later they are still insisting i pay the higher bill not worth it,Bad
3343,firstly take hours out of your day to call them be prepared to be transferred serveral times with staff passing the calls not wanting to deal with you and only take sales calls i only rang to upgrade happy to pay extra they did not place my order rang another further times and had to replace my order to be told no stock the call handler did not speak very good english and refused to transfer me to there manager this company should be and fined by the regulator,Bad
3344,ive had poor service since switching to virgin supposed to be getting at least mbs on the m fiber package average speeds are around mbps customer service is atrocious took mins to get passed through to technical who then listened to my issue said they would investigate and then left me on hold for over half hour called back and logged a complaint was promised a manager callback withing hrs no call ever came,Bad
3345,avoid them at all cost i did a house move and i ended up with this month delay from the original date of installation in the new package sold to me in the end without my consent as the original package i ordered was no longer available because of the charged for a bt smart charged for contract hours today on call to verify this and still not incorrectly charged and pending customer care of course there are a few saving souls,Bad
3346,i have never had such an infuriating frustrating experience in my life i have been over charged been promised a contract that was then changed and when i question this they tried to charge me more to get the contract i originally agreed to customer service is an absolute joke always promise issues are resolved but then find they are not id advice anyone considering a contract with vodafone to stay clear awful company who do not care about loyal customers,Bad
3347,absolutely appalling here is some of the rubbish virgin put me through cancelling my direct debit then charging me an admin fee hanging up on me on the phone when i called to cancel said fee told me it was impossible and then someone else cancelled it an unusable site some site pages that you need to perform some change to your account simply dont exist and it just says oops spotty service at best download throttling blocks websites at the isp level looks like theyre down but if you check via a vpn you can see is better that being a customer at virgin media,Bad
3348,stay away from them at all costs vodafone had a technical issue with setting up direct debits so they couldnt take my direct debit payment and i had to pay manually afterwards which meant they charged me for late payment it took at least dozen calls for them to set the direct debit up properly and credit my account this month i received a text saying my payment is overdue after calling them i found out that vodafone cancelled my direct debit without informing me and now i was late to pay which means that i was charged for the late payment they are telling me they cant do anything about it because i should have made sure my bill was paid on time doesnt matter whether i knew or not about the direct debit being cancelled now i believe they do anything to overcharge you as much as possible and of course whenever you need to call them you have to wait ridiculously long once i waited literally for an hour plus they have no respect to their customers and when theres a problem all they say is that they cant do anything,Bad
3349,customer service poor employees rude devices supplied rubbish i been with ee for year and all ill say is i regret being a customer,Bad
3350,i had been with virgin media for over years since birmingham cable days and had been fairly happy with the service every year or so though they announced yet another price rise and i would phone to complain they made small reductions on condition i stayed with them for at least one more year all was well until i moved to a new home i wanted to take my existing services there but although well within their franchised area they had never cabled my estate i therefore gave the required days notice and had to leave them and source other service providers they then reminded me that i still had six months of the contract remaining i expected that they would waive this under the circumstances in short they just keep drawing my attention to the cancellation charges in their tcs for a saving of just per month they are billing me for over they had provided no additional expensive equipment or services it seems though that i will end up with a bad credit rating if i refuse to pay my choice is therefore limited to cancelling every remaining service i have with them mobile travel insurance and savings avoiding ever travelling with them and telling as many as i can to avoid them like the plague,Bad
3351,very very bad and worse customer service i have ever seen they asked me to give me new phone they offered plenty of things but that all was fake and they even didnt upgrade my phone it anything tried to contact plenty of times all stuff are stupid and misguided people they supposed to give me iphones and it has to be delivered but when i phoned they said i never canceled or anything they even didnt care not supportive at all i m just pissed of their service never ever upgrade my contract with them,Bad
3352,im not sure of his position but the manager at the front of the store dan according to his badge was very unhelpful and kept telling me to call up customer services on the phone even though i had told him several times that i had tried this and had no success cant wait to leave vodafone,Bad
3353,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad
3354,every month i get a text telling me i am being cut off or put on a high charge rate this despite being assured every month that i have an ongoing payment i recently was on a boat trip off the scottish coast when i got a text telling me as i was in the usa i was going to be charged large amounts for texts and phone soon as i can find a comparable plan that is one with unlimited texts and minutes but no data i will be it system clearly is very poor,Bad
3355,reported broadband down sep told earliest engineer was sep i missed him as i was told the wrong time will send him again sep so keeping days high no abysmal service tt we ahead in the race to the bottom on customer that ringing the community does is get you to the people i spent hours on the phone with on saturday broadband completely unhelpful insisted that ringing days was the best they could do for an open reach now the phone is dead perhaps thats what happens when you complain,Bad
3356,the worst company for broadband in uk when you have a problem they will never fall out of a problem the other day i told the customer services the phone call is recorded from my side and she told me im not allowed to record any calls by the law even if i told them in advance but we have right to record our course she said they keep charging me more money for no reason is there a mistake and they say is our mistake ill be calling them time of the time but problem is still there,Bad
3357,put proper people on contact phones who want to help weeks is shocking to fix a minor fault,Bad
3358,your website never works it wont let me view my bill absolute mess,Bad
3359,what a con if i could rate i would they use they o network and on busy times i can get around mb per second at least the unlimited plan i got around at quiet times and worse when the network is purchased the unlimited plan after speaking to them over the phone i was told to go online when i was ready buy a data plan and check the speed etc if this was no good i could get a refund i ordered the sim and as soon as this was the speed i had was below mb per second with a full signal none of the online webchat team are english and it shows with thier replies i contacted who logged a call with the tech team to look into my issue i had a text to say my apn settings were correct which i had already gone through with the webchat person after that text the speed was still just as slow so i asked for a refund around hours after activating the sim and straight after their text reply i was told that if you use the data plan you cant have it refunded even though the new sim has no plan attached and you are directed straight to thier bundle page to buy a plan you cant go anywhere else on the internet until the plan is purchased so your not able to test the speed now asked for a refund from paypal as over the last four days and many online chats no one can see my issue or help in anyway after reading their reply below you can see once again they have totally missed the point and have no clue in how to support their customers the point i was trying to get across was you have to buy a bundle to try their sim out if its no good you cannot get a refund as you have used the for info i did try the sim in my unlocked mobile and its still much slower than an o sim,Bad
3360,unbelievably bad the chat line takes almost as long as the phone calls and also gets absolutely nowhere i cancelled the mobile service via chat line in nov they confirmed at the time and have still been billing me up til now may they have just sent me a letter threatening debt collectors and blacklisting my credit for unpaid bills which they have generated all by themselves ever since i have not used the service at all ever in the chat line enquiry today the agent said the line had been terminated by me before the cancellation went through this is a complete lie but i cant prove it as they will send me a copy of the truncated conversation to cover the tt broadband well thats laughable it disconnects frequently and when it is actually connected its so slow that it scrolls repeatedly playing video clips they did send the right engineer round after days of complaining and hours and hours on the phone he agreed that the fault was at the cabinet it didnt stop them from billing me for the engineer service call anyway and a few weeks later we were back to rubbish connection again the area has good connection apparently so it really is down to tt tt may be cheap but then the service is so diabolical and the billing so biased in their favour its really not worth it my mobile g is faster cheaper and more reliable so i will be tethering from now on free at last to get on with my life,Bad
3361,an awful experience the amount of times that ive contacted them and had not resolved any of my issues is insane so disappointed with the customer service,Bad
3362,i have not received the item i asked for and am to say i have been a loyal customer to you from a very long time was hoping as i have been loyal and i just wanted an replacement sim card with my previous number it would not be that hard to do so from your with great regret i have been let down realy way cand regards and thank you for your service,Bad
3363,asked them to stop sending me marketing emails and phone calls but they still keep emailing me and phoning also dont tell you that you need to make the final payment manually rather than dd they dont tell you that you owe a balance until you see a missed payment on your credit box is slow and rubbish but their broadband was very good and very reliable,Bad
3364,ongoing poor broadband service and call package for a vulnerable and disabled lady rang to cancel the agreement following price increase told i could cancel anytime up to the th of july phoned today to confirm cancellation then told i would incur charges tried to suggest there was nothing on their records about previous telephone contact now waiting for them to review previous and minutes waiting time for them to answer avoid this business,Bad

3366,i have been with orange for some years my last contract was taken out months ago at that time the mobile signal where i live in devon was reasonable for the past year the signal has degraded to a point whereby it is no longer possible to send or receive calls and texts nine calls to orange customer care have made no difference whatsoever promises of a fix within fourteen days have never materialised a direct email to the ceo elicited a nil response a recent phone call to tech services took nearly mins did not resolve the issue and the sim card is now inoperable orange are now in breach of their contract they are the absolute pants as a network operator and flaunt the law their customer service is now non existent i would never use orange or recommend them in fact give them a wide wide berth i am now seeking legal advice to sue for breach of contract,Bad

3370,so i joined vodafone in and had no problems until my phone broke and since was out of warranty had to get another one i got a nokia and had to get a micro sim so went instore to get a new sim for my contract they took no info so i took the sim and left what they had done was activated someone else s number onto my sim and if i wasnt honest i could be running all sorts of bills on that number so i thought this is fraud or at least a breach of the data protection act so i went back to sort the issue and then emailed to make a complaint as its dangerous territory if it happened again so that was sorted then a price increase came and i thought well my phone doesnt work so ill go to o i was within my rights to leave and i got told i cant i eventually spoke to a manager who apologized and said as a good will gesture since i only had months left on my contract i can upgrade early so i thought ok why not this was a year ago since then i have experienced some of the worst service in my life i am so stressed i feel im on the verge of a breakdown i had a couple of issues with my phone which were sorted easily enough but in december i moved home big mistake i told vodafone of my new address and didnt think anything of it until i had a charge on my bill i didnt understand so i called to double check it and as part of security they asked me to confirm my address so i did and got sorry that isnt what we have here i thought ok probably just a mistake so they said they would change i got another price increase so contacted them to find out about it and again sorry your address hasnt been updated i was slightly mad at this point so asked them to do it again then i thought i would double check a week or so later and no it hadnt been done but i will do this now and i will have a manager call in hours about your complaint i was fuming a week later i heard nothing so i contacted them and this time the agent didnt even bother to follow the data protection act so i blew my lid and asked to speak to a manager as the address hadnt been updated again and i will update this and i will have another manager to call you in hours so i left it again and still no call so i went on the chat so i could keep a record of the conversation and got so mad at the agent as it hadnt been done again and a manager finally called me back the manager was the most rude and arrogant person i have ever spoken to and i work in customer service too so thats saying something again he promised he would do it and then said well im going now i have other escalations to deal with and i got told to write in so i did and recorded delivery i went back today as i knew it wasnt done and behold it still wasnt changed i struggled to keep calm but i spoke to agent and it was finally done i couldnt believe it i called back again to make sure but bottom line is on payday i will pay my breakage fee because i cant take the stress of being with vodafone i cant wait to go to o i apologize for the grammar i am still really really mad as i just got off the phone to them please save yourself the stress and go somewhere else,Bad
3371,i never got a top up paid via paypal constant error while trying to send sms not recognizing international phone numbers sudden lack of service for days insolent staff,Bad
3372,during a trip to amsterdam i was scammed by this company when i purchased a sim card they said the sim card would also work in belgium and france but it did not,Bad
3373,they could not solve a very simple thing before we get a deal we were told there will be no activation fees as we are regular customer no engineer was needed for installation we had to talk for more than and half hour to get a solution i think some of the staff are not well qualified for the job finally it was sorted frustrated upset wast of time,Bad
3374,was with virgin media broadband for two years they constantly phoned me to try and up sell tv and phone packages despite me requesting numerous times for them to stop when i eventually cancelled the service they made it very difficult i then received a bill for a cancellation fee two weeks after the account was closed this was never communicated to me during the lengthy cancellation process and when i phoned up to query it i was told by the operator that it was your fault for not reading the cancellation terms all this despite the fact that i had far exceeded the length of my contract and should have been able to cancel at any time,Bad
3375,in my now long life i am i have never encountered such incompetence as that shown by talktalk they are absolutely appalling and should be avoided at all costs the ombudsman services must be tired of dealing with complaints about them,Bad
3376,disgusting company full of excuses my broadband kept dropping so i rang them the lady goes its because of anyway she clearly had no clue just a operator with a book of excuses in front of her then few days later dropped again like every mins so i ring them up again yup another lady with a book of excuses this time the excuse was i have to many devices connected to the hub which i found strange because iv always had the same amount of device connected for the last years so i challenged her and explained about her devices excuse which she wasnt happy about she turned around and said so you telling me what the problem is with the wifi and im like are you serious anyway when i upgraded with them months ago i was giving a promise to always to be connected so i asked her about the promise she replied its not a guarantee its a promise i was so shocked i said so your promise means nothing then she replied if you want a guarantee then u will need to upgrade which i told her where to go the moral of the story is your dealing with a bunch of uneducated low paid workers with no technical skills been trained with a book of excuses to use i only have to wait till november then bin these con artist,Bad
3377,had the worst experience with talk talk in our house move we had to wait days for the new wifi to be switched on after moving when i asked why the delay they didnt give an answer on live day it still wasnt talk talk again as it was just flashing orange and told to wait until midnight despite having emails from talk talk stating it was not live i had not been informed of this before waited until midnight so days after move and would you believe it it still didnt work called talk talk again and yet again another delay having to wait days for an engineer to come around we booked and expected a the evening before to tell us the exact time never received this called this morning and was told that its actually which means we have to wait in all day i asked how much to leave and would have charged even staying they havent honoured my request for my old contract to be continued at has been upped to so its either pay and leave or stick paying its been so ridiculously slow every time you call you get told different info and no reasoning dont that it will work even when the engineer turns they do i asked to raise a complaint ans was put on hold so long i hung up sometimes they put you on hold for no reason ans dont you whats going to lorraine no i cant tweet or facebook as i dont have either of these,Bad
3378,terrible customer service my charges have gone up and when i rang about this they wanted to offer me a different package over just dont get it and fail to engage with customers genuine concerns about ever increasing costs way over the inflation rate,Bad
3379,bt cancelled my account for no reason they had no idea why it had happened their only solution was to sign me up again as a customer which involved days without the internet,Bad
3380,i have been speaking to numerous ppl on the social media site who have done nothing i want a manager to call me ive requested this a few times now your staff have ignored me and are asking stupid questions are rude and unhelpful l wish to take the complain higher but im being ignored typical for your poor company i cant provide telephone numbers as a they dont want me to l provided a couple of examples of problems l was having these were ignored l provided a dropped call yesterday after being asked to at the last minute she wants my friends number my friend has declined data protection the time of the call should be adequate information but it seems wants me to do their job for them weeks ive been asking for a manager to contact me and ive been up i have no idea if a complain has been lodged as your staff couldnt be bothered to actually investigate my complaint so waited now disabled all this time and your supervisor rings up nice girl but ive told her l want her to call me l always check social media thing is nothing has been done and i get rude comments from your staff sorry but arent you supposed to be investigating this matter lots of platitudes lots of were sorry little movement ive asked now times to speak to a manager any working ive heard lots of excuses and the fact you have two masks dead in my area and one under maintenance seems not to be an issue yet hear l am constantly contacting you,Bad
3381,avoid this company at all costs i had taken out a contract a few months ago and i am unable to receive text messages from people other than the ones that are on vodafone customer service had said they have fixed it and have not eventually it got to a point they agreed to cancel it but yet again they made an excuse because i have brought it from carphone warehouse i was told it will be fixed in the next few days and agreed to cancel if it isnt fixed think again before buying from vodafone as you will be paying for a very bad service,Bad
3382,bunch of charlatans i had accounts with vodafone and wished to cancel one and get a better deal on the other as i was out of contract i went to the store in person where they advised that i had to dial or go online to cancel moreover they could not offer me a competitive deal in store i went online logged in and saw an offer of pcm for months but was not able to switch because this was only available to new customers when i called to question this policy the best they could offer was over months ie higher cost and longer contract this represents a clear case of a loyalty penalty which may explain why my substantial shareholding has performed so badly in recent months the only saving grace is that the competition is equally bad based on my experience of visiting ee and stores in harrogate where the staff made me wait for half an hour before harvesting my data and offering a deal that is twice the cost of online alternatives then they send you the inevitable how did we do text total bloody shambles,Bad
3383,absolutely terrible from charges that never should have applied shocking internet connection the tv in my bedroom picks up of my neighbours signals stronger than virgin i spent months only being able to watch netflix upstairs because the signal was so weak complained got rings on a friday teatime vm and a voucher roll on march and the end of my contract,Bad
3384,i ordered home wifi hotspot horrible network quality horrible customer support extremely hard to contact them because they are hiding behind a wall of chat bots,Bad
3385,i was a customer of tesco mobile for a number of years before leaving due to having a mobile service tied to my broadband and tv provider i returned to tesco mobile weeks ago and have regretted it since the mobile data is very poor in all most areas except london and the reception for calls and text is the rely on having a mobile service for my work unfortunately i was to late to cancel my contract and am now stuck with them for months i have since taken out a contract with whos reception is still patchy but better than tesco,Bad
3386,awful customer services i was told that i was getting a free fibre upgrade two appointments made two days off work booked never showed up tried to find out what was going on through customer on the phone passed from department to department not able to help tried online chat couldnt service was barely above rude no idea who i am supposed to contact to resolve this,Bad
3387,i tried reaching customer care but after waiting for over an hour nobody bothered to pick the phone deducts plans without customers knowledge and dont even respond pathetic worst experience,Bad
3388,i have been with them for years my contract is up and they refuse to give me the deal that they are doing for new customers i will never use again and their broadband service is appalling,Bad
3389,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
3390,please find an alternative broadband provider to cant comprehend how companies as large as talktalk and are so inept and been without broadband for days now and they cant manage to book and engineer between them ive spent nearly hours on the phone over the last day and wasted half a day off waiting for an engineer not to turn upi only scored star as isnt urge you not to use talktalk,Bad
3391,after leaving this useless rip off bunch of jerks years ago im now forced to give this company money again because i was with sse and they sold us to origin who talk talk own another reason never to use this company they will rip you off lie to you and bill you excessively and if you want to speak with customer services hope you speak hindi or punjab cos they wont speak english,Bad
3392,absolute joke i told them i am moving properties and would love to have them as a supplier but to my shock they do not cover my but all my other neighbours in my flat block of flats same building have virgin now after joining them for not even months i am already stuck with a early termination fee their customer service is absolute joke would not recommend this will not care about any of your concerns but will immediately call you if you are late day with your payments i hope they go bankrupt,Bad
3393,shocking customer service no one seems to know what they are doing when you phone up i set up a direct debit when i took out my phone contract but still had to pay over the phone if it wasnt for my daughter sorting it out for mei would still be paying over the phone even thou i had set up a direct debit and as for the broadband its pretty shocking for going down,Bad
3394,the customer service is absolutely shocking honestly the worst i have ever ever ever experienced i would never go with virgin again even if they paid me from day one and every month onwards i was billed more than i should have and every time i call to correct it for next month it comes through the higher amount again after months of this i demand a cancellation it continued next month please cancel never happened third time finally cancelled they cancelled my direct debit no more virgin finally but the box to return the goods never came the wifi was still connected and the dreaded bill came at the wrong price called to cancel and i got late payment charges despite virgin cancelling the direct debit on my behalf now pressured into paying them despite the many months of wasted phone calls to avoid whatever impact it could have on a credit score it is honestly not worth it i spent more time dealing with the issues than actually using the internet i was paying for male west london house of two,Bad
3395,final edit after finally getting this sorted and confirmed by vodafone that the charge has actually been cancelled this time i checked my credit score a few months later and it says ive missed a f payment for them damaging my credit score even though the issue was sorted and they confirmed i shouldnt pay it complete joke of a company almost months after this situation should have been sorted i receive a letter from a debt collection agency i contacted their staff multiple times in march april and june each time they confirmed the account had been cancelled and i wouldnt receive charges obviously they were lying as this letter dated august says my account has only now been closed vodafone you are the worst company i have ever dealt with i have had to deal with this for the past months all because of your staffs failure to cancel my account when i asked i even asked before my contract was due to end and you are still charging me for months after its ended theyve added on some admin charges i should be charging you for all my time ive wasted and hassle your causing mei have already wasted almost hours being passed around to various vodafone advisors a few times passed to the incorrect team trying to cancel a contract that had already ended weeks prior i had also already been in contact with them weeks before and they confirmed there would be no more charges only to find out that it had not in fact been cancelled and they were trying to charge me for another month for a number i hadnt used in almost a year and didnt even set up myself they also refused to issue me any kind of refund or partial refund instead kept on pestering me to upgrade and start spending more even though i was paying double the amount i should of as i checked online and could of got the same deal with them for half the price at the time contract was agreed i believe they said they were giving me a better deal than others and also giving me free data which clearly wasnt true in the end i had to just cancel my direct debit to avoid being charged because they refused to admit their mistake i honestly hope this is the end of it and they dont continue to persue the extra month that they are trying to incorrectly charge me worst company ever,Bad
3396,i wish i could give stars this is by far the worst customer service i have ever talked to they literally do not understand anything they dont try help at all and all they do is asking you to call different numbers in order to get the service that you ask for,Bad
3397,a perfect example of a rotten company who simply continue to exist because of a monopoly that was placed in their lap they own the phone lines so can be as inept and useless as they like and youre stuck with them,Bad
3398,we are virgin media customers that are looking to move home in months time when advising virgin media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services the only thing that i could do was to pay the a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a rd party provider that cannot provide the full virgin media tv service i was given options pay a early disconnection charge or pay a month for a poor service as mentioned i was happy to stick to virgin media for the duration but they could not provide the same service they have it written up in their ridiculous contracts that you do not have a choice so beware what you are signing into i took the disconnection charge as quite frankly the service is not that good we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem it turned out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin media did not pick up with regards to the tv the pause rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky offers its slow and the screen often blurs we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both i would highly recommend sky over virgin media any day of the week the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it,Bad
3399,virgin media decided to increase my bills by didnt bother informing me and have told be theres nothing i can do about it as my right to cancel period has already expired as soon as my contract is up ill cancel and never return deplorable company,Bad

3410,after a visit to our new local o store cirencester we agreed on an upgrade that gave us a new phone plus a and signing bonus that paid off the remaining contract on the old phone by reducing the monthly tariff to a minimum after collecting the new handset they reduced the value offered for the old one didnt reduce the tariff on the old phone and tried to take over payment to terminate the old contract two months have passed and despite having a written copy of the terms agreed signed by the store manager many return visits to the shop and calls to o we have not received the signing bonus or resolved the matter of the excessive charges it appears that the o were prepared to go to any lengths and make any promises to grab new business from us while hoping that wed give up fighting them when they failed to deliver sorry guys think again next stop a formal complaint to gloucestershire trading standards and an online small claims action for the money owed and our costs incurred for travel and administration,Bad
3411,absolute joke do not sign up with virgin media broadband since installation last year i have had four outages in my area which took about hours also to they work on automated reimbursement scheme as well which means that the system calculates if im eligible for a refund due to the outage based on the duration of time it took to fix conveniently it never has felt that i am due a due to these outages what it fails to understand is you and if the problem is fixed within an hour the cumulative effect of multiple outages in the space of one year should amount to a refund customer service advisors are not able to help with that either more importantly working from home these outages account for a significant amount of inconvenience and time wastage secondly i live in a three bedroom house normal sized with mostly plaster walls and yet i cant get internet signals from the wifi on the first floor in the bedrooms virgin media charges a month extra for the boosters and says that they cant guarantee wifi signal everywhere in the going with them again getting out of the contract as soon as it runs out,Bad
3412,the most rubbish customer service i have ever been given this person mary joy was taking forever asking soooo many details and insisting on marketing preferences i was asking her to escalate me to the manager but she was hellbent on getting marketing preferences from me i have a flight to catch i spent more than half an hour with her just trying to get the tv package off i had no patience to put up with her and adamant service to get another package for wanted to have another broadband package but now i have decided to just go for another company,Bad
3413,i pay for the fasted internet package bt offer however i cant make a conference call or facetime without delays speak to people over a matter of weeks on the phone and they test the line and say everything is ok but still same issue they send out engineers and say everything is fine so i call again and tell them there are latency issues which is causing the problem so they agree to send out an engineer today between and i call at to make sure they are still coming and i get told they are i call at and am told they are unsure so will call me back within an hour no call back so i ring again and speak to someone who tells me to try something else but advised what would really work is an extender and ethernet cable into the laptop sounded good until he told me i would have to pay for this or he would give me credit even though they are over so in to have a conference call on my laptop i need an ethernet cable running up the stairs or an extender that i have to pay for not sure what my a month gets me i have to pay for the privilege of having a conference call when i already pay for the most expensive broadband then ask why the engineer didnt turn upi was advised that the person i spoke to yesterday shouldnt have booked the engineer in at such short notice so it must have failed and been cancelled without the need to tell the me turns out bt book appointments with engineers and cancel them and then cant be arsed to even let the customer poor service,Bad
3414,booked upgrade to fastest broadband earliest engineer visit was a month later arranged visit for between to avoid school run engineer didnt turn up called bt times and was passed pillar to post with no definite answer as to what will happen with my order stressful and bad service disappointed teenagers as need faster broadband for gaming will look to cancel,Bad
3415,this company renewed my contract without my permission and than tried to charge me to cancel eventually after months of trying to speak to a competent member of staff the matter was resolved and the charge was withdrawn but the charge did show up on my credit history imagine if i was trying to get a mortgage or a important loan i would stay well away from this company,Bad
3416,i hate the site with a vengeance my personal experience is that it doesnt work properly and has been in this state for years and thats not an understatement to have left it so long in such a botched state shows they really dont care for the time i cant login and cant reset my password or username this is how it typically goes i give my email and password and i get an error message forgotten your password no problem just tell us your username and well send you an email so you can reset it so i give my email the same one they email me on that i previously used to login to my account with and i get there seems to be a problem with your account please try again or contact seem to have given us the wrong user name please try again so i use my phone number instead one that i know is registered and previously had access to i get sorry we cant reset your password as youve entered a number thats not registered please check carefully and try again guess what happens when i try to enter my account number you guessed it another were so sorry error what ever you do never never never pay via the website its so buggy that one time they double charged me when i contacted customer services i got this response i have checked the system and can see that due to some technical error the payment was taken twice hoorah can i have my money back then no they wouldnt give it back instead choosing to credit my account so my next bill would be taken from the credit,Bad
3417,my router isnt working correctly i rang up and they asked me to call back after a few days to book an engineer i did when i did they said they couldnt do it i complained then they did it they then said as a they would send me a mobile booster i rang to order it and they said they couldnt i rang again and said they would they have now charged me for this booster and its not arrived my internet is great the customer service from virgin is some of the worst i have ever experienced no one seems to know the processes or know what they can or cannot do there is always a massive queue to speak to someone and they are genuinely hopeless i can honestly say that if there was a provider who offered remotely similar speeds i would leave virgin without a second thought in addition to that i also raised a separate written complaint on your system thats been entirely ignored,Bad
3418,only give one star as couldnt give i ordered talk talk broadband nearly weeks ago said i would get wifi hub before engineer came out but this never happened my partner whos name its in has had numerous calls to explain the updates but couldnt understand a word they said english is completely shocking and ended up hanging up the phone as was like speaking in a foreign language each time i spoke to somebody called on web chat on the website but was hopeless it took an hour just to verify my personal details which was just email address and full name engineer came today but still without the actual wifi box disgusting for such a well known recognized company at the end of my tether now,Bad
3419,service issues since am apparently fixed at pm however according to the advice im now getting on my phone through my phone signal the hub isnt connected properly so they have had to spend hours fixing an issue that was in fact a hub not connected properly many of my neighbours have the same issue so does that mean the installers are to blame pretty poor service avoid,Bad
3420,i have just left ee and went to talk talk from day one with ee i have had problems the line was awful i had to have engineers out to it before it was resolved but in order to get them out i had to use my mobile phone to call them and they refused to credit me for the nearly phone call to all the was through my contract the internet was so painfully slow they only said if i paid more i can have a faster i have left them they have charged me saying that the cancellation i needed to give them started from the time i went live with talk talk so i paid for weeks with different companies i have spend nearly hours on the phone trying to get this resolved but to no avail please please steer clear of these do off would be nil stars if i could give it,Bad
3421,do not purchase the wifi extenders they are total waste of money the product was in fact by talktalk,Bad
3422,talk talk are by far the worst provider of broadband i have ever had i would strongly recommend you say as far away as possible my partner and myself recently moved into a new home and had talk talk out in the wifi just keeps stopping and starting and is the worst internet i had ever had when you phone customer help line you get put in contact with someone you can hardly understand and they dont do anything about it im having to cancel the contract and wait for another provider that will be coming to install this means another weeks with internet just save yourself the hassle and go with another provider,Bad
3423,days before install is due to complete a fault means they can no longer offer the service even though they performed all the pre tests and installed the cable to my home i am now left with nothing no timeline for a solution no contract no network dont believe their lies theres a reason theyre so cheap its a con they are not ready i feel like a total mug for taking a risk on some new blood stick with more established providers to avoid the same situation i now find myself in update its a shame your engineering team isnt as proactive as your social media teams maybe then i wouldnt be left without internet and out of contract at great expense financially and mentally chasing you to even get a response before my internet dies maybe line tests should be done before you sell people products you cannot deliver,Bad
3424,what can i hasnt arrived very disappointed have waited in now days for parcel force to will probably end in i will buy from amazon,Bad
3425,after giving a star review for the initial customer service ive had to leave a star after changing over network providers ive been left with no service for days this has massively affected business and been infuriating to deal with especially when they said we will call back when we can sort it not possible when im complaining about no to be avoided,Bad

3448,things didnt start well when i discovered virgin use as their delivery company well known for being the worst delivery company in the ordered the quick start broadband package nothing was quick and in fact it never started because the experience virgin gave me so abysmal that i cancelled my contract with them before it even whole story is too long to tell but just to mention a few points cannot give you an estimated delivery time hence one has to take the whole day off to wait around for and virgin dont communicate with other and just pass on the blame for errors to each other leaving the customer taking the hit with costly time and to their help screwed up the delivery as per usual sent it to the wrong address did not attempt to communicate with me in any shape or form and didnt leave a calling agents on the phone first quote is always im sorry but i cannot do anything else for you in truth it takes min of battle and arguing on the phone for them to put you through to someone that agents in their systematically give incorrect advice in my case this led to a day completely wasted petrol and parking cost wasted when i was sent on a wild goose chase to a virgin high st shop because they will be able to help guess it no they didnt and god knows how much i will be billed for approx hours on the phone to beginning to end a nightmare and i would hope everyone listens to this and stays clear of them in the future yes they are slightly cheaper and slightly faster but the aggro isnt worth it trust me after i cancelled the contract with them the problems didnt stop because as before and virgin didnt communicate with each other and ended up delivering not one but two quick start packaged to my neighbour without my permission so now i need to waste my time further returning the modems to started with one day later and i had a working in days and internet in seven couldnt have been faster and clear of virgin,Bad

3454,first of all this review is being made on behalf of the account holder well if you have a shred of sense you will stay away from talktalk and go to a company who does comply with ofcom rules and regulations unlike this bunch of losers ive been with talktalk for many years and in the services you pay for are not worth a dime anymore lets start with the first problem out of three march th fibre broadband reported a broadband fault to talktalk in the hope that they would comply with the days they had to fix the issue without fibre broadband months later and still not fixed i told these idiots they call tech support the problem is on the outside of the property and with me working in broadband tech support myself i knew all the ins and outs of troubleshooting my equipment and testing the test socket to make sure it isnt a faulty faceplate guess what talktalk seems to think the problem is on the inside of the property and after agreeing to a sfi engineer visit i waited for the sfi to arrive on the day so when the sfi turned up from all he did was run a speed test via not exactly the most accurate test ever which read fine he also checked my routers firmware again i made sure of this before the sfi appointment was made made me sign it off as no errors inside and the problem must be outside this came from the sfi so after wasting my day and being worse off because of your companies staff i called talktalk back to tell them the sfi ruled out the premises as the main location of the broadband issue to get the response back that i need a second sfi visit after refusing the sfi visit i was told that they couldnt help me resolve the issue which then lead to me getting in touch with the companies ceo business manager lauren maitland who was also not much better than the call centre staff based in india after explaining to her my issue with the call centre staff and how they do not care about their customers i was told to rethink my attitude why because your staff dont care it gets better with lauren as on numerous occasions of trying to contact this woman was very hard to actually speak to her and insisted our communications was done via email fair enough no complaint there after sending off speed test results to lauren so that she could send them off to bt for further investigation days later i get a call from lauren to tell me that from weeks earlier that i was right the problem is on the outside of my home all though i do feel this is because i reported the company to ofcom the same day i sent the speed test results so after finding that my local cabinet had been due an upgrade and would take weeks this can literally take hours i have bt engineers as friends who can confirm it takes hours i had been given free fibre for months which doesnt fix my problem and basically feels like a bribe to keep me quiet luckily the nice people of bt wholesale and bt sorted the issue and i owe my thanks to them not talktalk second complaint the data protection act linked into the first complaint now i am not the account holder and i understand how dpa works but for some reason talktalk grandmother is the account holder and i am authorised on the account now on every single call made to a call centre you have to pass dpa or the call cannot continue so why when i call as the authorised user on the account is nobody asking me for my full name or password on the account i have had to beg and plead for advisors and a manager to pass dpa with me and have also told them that they are breaching dpa again lauren maitland was involved after i sent her an email telling her how disgusted i am with how theyre staff are not dpa compliant it took her days to respond and by this time i had gone to ofcom and then to the information commissioners office to make a dpa complaint her response wasnt exactly showing high levels of care that her staff are not passing dpa on every call third complaint mobile phone contract so my grandmothers mobile contract was up for renewal last month august and negotiated the same sim only plan she was on for the months previous of mins texts and mb of data for per month on a month contract so again talktalk why the hell am i having to call you again because you have an elderly customer a mobile plan im not even going to write the fourth complaint because this should be enough for people to stay away from talktalk sort your staff out and sort out your lame excuse for a high rolling company,Bad
3455,absolutely shameful all services disconnected altogether without a word of warning despite telling them last week that the money hasnt been taken they informed me that it is pending and not to worry it will be collected days later the money hasnt been taken and now no internet or mobile service have to work from home and will not be able to until resolved i understand the impact of but not being able to get through to anyone has left me very frustrated despite paying all of the balance now they refuse to reconnect my broadband due to their so called policies and their response is in a nutshell i would need to set up a new account thanks but no thanks taking my business elsewhere,Bad
3456,today we tried to access virgin on demand but there was an error message c we phoned virgin and was put through to a call centre in india and after minutes of being asked to reset our tivo box and home router and various other tests were told that there was an outage in the area why they couldnt identify this fault from the start is beyond me i said that we needed on demand that evening as we had guests and so what compensation could be offered for not being able to access this when we needed to i was told that there was no compensation being offered after some discussion i was then told that there might be some compensation but if it was offered it would automatically be applied and would be based on the duration of the outage all in all i am not satisfied we have lost our planned entertainment for the evening and i have lost valuable time getting nowhere on the phone not happy with virgin media and the compensation resolution is entirely unsatisfactory,Bad
3457,awful customer service ordered an apple watch the other day and they took nearly out of my bank and then said that the order is under review and they are starting to take my monthly payments out absolutely disgusting,Bad
3458,not satisfied we had a problem with our old talk talk equipment we have been customers for about years our television and internet were not working properly so i phoned talk talk technical department i was unaware the the no they gave me was a premium no the technician kept me on the phone for around an hour he didnt make me aware that it was costing me and didnt offer to phone me back i had to contact them again next day have been charged for the privilege and went two days with loss of service no offer for loss of service we pay for disgusting service will be leaving talk talk in april,Bad

3464,absolutely horrible company christine from complain department should never been allowed to deal with customers for years theyve been calling me and asking whether i want to update my contact then one day theyve sent sneaky email to inform tha contact expired they then increased my fees by without ringing me as theyve been doing this over the past years i fought hard trying to get extra charges back but they believe that they did nothing wrong avoid this at any cost,Bad
3465,after talking to three agents over a protracted period of time i was promised that the reported fault would be forwarded to a higher team and that i would hear from them within three days the fault still exists after three days and no contact from talk talk very poor communication and service,Bad
3466,if you expect help to rectify a fault in my case no land line then do not expect it to happen very soon we are now days without a phone line and two days of our land line is our life line literally in a household with two elderly and partially disabled people it does not seem to draw much response from talk talk what happens in non urgent cases i happy,Bad
3467,absolutely awful customer service they dont provide what you pay for and if you have an issue there is no way to talk to a human being how can a phone company not actually speak to customers on the phone avoid,Bad
3468,never use virgin media this is the worst provider company and customer service ever,Bad
3469,virgin media have a consistent lack of ability to properly communicate with customers when something does not work or to manage customers expectations for example this week our broadband and phone line just stopped working on monday evening no warning from them even though we found out they were doing planned upgrades to the network it is now thursday night and we still have no service the virgin media website which is supposed to list the service status was down more often than up so we could not even check the service status on our mobile phones we took to relying on down detector instead the virgin website now says the service will be down until next monday afternoon which if accurate which i doubt going on past experience will mean we will have been without broadband for over a week no ability to work from home no phone no doorbell no connected facilities because they have cut off our broadband with no warning in broadband is a utility akin to water and electricity virgins behaviour cavalier attitude to customers and just not caring that what it does affects its customers and its failures to properly communicate regretfully means i have to advise you to avoid this company like the plague basically use anyone else we actually had to go so far as to engage with them legally earlier this year when they took months to fix their exterior faulty wiring which prevented our landline phone working avoid avoid avoid they never apologise and always display lack of care their customer service is nonexistent with an automated system that takes minutes to navigate to speak to a person and when you finally get through the person you speak to is so they know nothing and just parrot their standard scripted responses,Bad
3470,got a cold call sometime in advertising free contract for a month asked the agent three times if it would go back to pay as you go she said yes after that month completed i heard nothing of it my phone then got stolen so for safe measure i asked for that sim to be locked and have a new one with the same number oh sorry you cant do that on contract rubbish first of all i shouldnt be on contract secondly numbers can be transferred when i begrudgingly asked if i can get rid of that contract i was told not without paying upfront the year worth of contract lady in the store was patronising put me on the phone to someone else because customers with real issues were main priority and in that call was told regardless of what i do im paying i phoned them again sometime later explained i shouldnt have even got a contract for months i only agreed to the month the agent then said oh well do you want me to listen to that call she couldnt actually follow through with it i know call centres work they have to dig out the call they charge you to receive the call in writing which takes longer than a week i decided without a phone i paid up front for because itd been stolen whats the use of the bloody contract i didnt agree to no terms were read to me no one mentioned anything about after that month nothing i called them again in may this year because now theyve sold my debt to some debt collectors who for intentionally sabotaging peoples credit scores even if they pay their debts and chase immediate family for debts that arent theirs to pay been putting letters through my mums door a minute call with a patronising scottish woman called stacy who was no help spoke to me the entire time in an accusative tone and kept putting me on hold to find out simple details about the partners they work with to send debt letters this company that somehow found my mums address and didnt even address it under the correct name she took minutes to only find out that they were employed by ee and that they could print letters using the ee logo which wasnt at all what i asked i asked to speak to someone who could efficiently look up my previous details and actually listen to the offending call that started all of this mess up that was dodged clearly their internal support is lacking but it was something she should have known i was told well you used the service its your fault in what bloody world is anyone with a life expected to have no phone to use anyway in spite of that in the past i paid up the debt stopped using the phone after it closed down the service over and theyre still harassing me over services ive not used but the call with stacy was the topper on the cake she was patronising she didnt know her facts without putting me on hold presumably to ask a colleague for help and at one point intentionally winding me up with smarmy questions for every single reason i provided for not being able to call the moment that month was up first of all i didnt know the contract was months i was told month for free then pay as you go secondly the dont you have friends who have phones question was the one that absolutely topper for this girls attitude and thirdly the first and second point combined how the hell is one supposed to call to complain about something prior to it happening on someones phone if you dont know the company have thrown you into a contract to begin with not to mention no one gave this company permission to use my mothers address theyre answer for that is we employ them but we cant speak for them they can speak for us though but theyre an investigative team who can access those details and will one would think thats a breach of personal data somewhere in there and to think i actually applied for a job there certainly dodged a bullet there store staff useless cold callers liars customer service agent smarmy af by all means services are good but their customer support in any format is god to say this review will go right over their heads as their templated response probably asking me for more details frankly the company can sod off this review is for other customers considering ee dont waste your time what started off as a compliment for being a long standing customer ended up being a major inconvenience that keeps haunting me after so long the company can do one cause ive had to move to another company since who dont make unsolicited cold calls with fabricated offers,Bad

3491,best way for you to form an opinion is by way of judging this online chat one of several trying to fix a slow speed at aug were sorry that youre not getting your minimum guaranteed speed of mbps we will do everything we can to fix our speed code of practice we have calendar days to make improvements but may need to talk to you again within this after days we cant improve your service we will notify you by email of your right to cancel your contract without any termination we fix the issue you change your package or we determine the issue is caused by something within your home the right to cancel will not at aug to confirm robert do you regularly turn your broadband router off for example do you switch your router off at brown at aug laptop has dropped to robert brown at aug no i dont turn it off unless tt ask me brown at aug youre going through all the same questions as a few weeks ago that led to tt sending me a new brown at aug the new router has not solved the at aug i do understand however as we run these checks it is for us to be able to see where the actual issue at aug the last time you spoke to us we identified the following telephone socket type see below can you please tell me if this is still correct and there have been no changes since we last spoke brown at aug same ask me to take the cover off again at aug does any of the equipment appear to be brown at aug same brown at aug youd better escalate this problem now im running out of time and brown at aug laptop has dropped to at aug i do understand that you have been through this process however we run these checks in order for us to see where the actual fault is as you have received a new router but still experiencing the same have detected that you have tested on your test socket so we are currently conducting further at aug im now running a quick check of your connectivity which will take about a minute to at aug thank you for your patience robert so we are done with checks and i can see that your connection is stable with a speed of mbps with the point of sales of mbps youre currently using wifi hub connecting which is our best can also confirm that youre usage over the past month is gb which is good for the level of service you are at aug in addition to the speed issues youve seen on your broadband connection we can also see there are issues affecting the wifi performance and reliability in your can send you a link or an email which provides details on how to optimise your home setup to get the best from your wifi would you like to receive the brown at aug there is no need for that when i connect my laptop by ethernet cable and its the only device in the house online the fault is still brown at aug same with my tablet stood in front of the brown at aug this laptop is capable of mbps because thats what it read when i took out this aug i do understand robert however on our end the diagnostics prove that your speed connection is good with no issues minimum guaranteed speeds on your account is mbps please note that speeds changes everyday depending on the number of devices used on that day and the apps being used in some days you will notice the speeds being lower than the guaranteed and sometimes much higher than the guaranteed at aug please bear with me while i check something on my end thank brown at aug ive never had much higher than the guaranteed download brown at aug not even at the beginning of this is where and my next went through almost the same procedure all over was ok at the beginning of this contract but something they are not willing or able to say has put me back to a relatively slow broadband speed whilst claiming they are not responsible even though they diagnosed a faulty router and replaced it to no frustrating what exactly guaranteed download speed mean to you,Bad

3493,awful company my father took out a mobile phone contract in his name some years back but when he passed away we did not spot the direct debits coming out until some years later my mother who is elderly was unaware of the contract as dad dealt with everything and she never uses mobile phones when we spotted the direct direct we cancelled it and asked for a refund backdated to dads death offering to send them the phone and sim to prove it was not bereavement team dont seem to care nor do their complaints dept so we now have to let the ombudsman bother with them is my advice they only care about the money not the customer,Bad

3500,today is sunday and i have been disconnected and can do nothing about it does anybody know how to contact on a sunday have recently switched banks and it appears they havent changed this direct debit to my new the week i contacted as i had a message telling me that they were unable to take a payment as they hadnt got my new details in time i asked to do a one off payment and gave my card details but they said they could not get authorisation the advisor said not to worry and my phone would be reconnected within hours even though at that point i had not been disconnected now today sunday i have no use of my phone which has caused me a lot of grief and i cannot get in touch with anyone to rectify the matter,Bad
3501,crooks two years ago i upgraded my son wife and myself on a contract where my son pays his own direct debit and i pay for my wifes and myself which has been ongoing for some years in feb they took in on themselves to start a direct debit in which my son started paying for his and my next i went on a tour and called and ask if i could purchase extra gb data on top of gb on my contract while on the trip this i was explained was a one off payment which turned out to be a complete lie because they had started charging my wifes account to my son direct debit my bill was about the same so i was unaware that from that date they repeatedly charged me an extra per month over the next months even though i failed to use even my basic contract allowance continued charging me for the extra unused all only came to light this week when my son questioned why there was two direct debits i was told by a customer service manager at voda that none of this their fault all mine apparently i was told that the was for me to cancel and that in the small print that was emailed to me this was stated also changing a direct debit happens occasionally although i paid per month for months and they changed the direct debit they gave me as a gesture of good will i wish i could charge customers for something they dont want or get and if i set up a direct debit without authorisation from the account holder i would probably get locked up but its all in their small print and they have done nothing icing on the cake is they carried on with the extra with mentioning it on my last upgrade which the manager says is quite normal even though on my most recent upgrade they removed it maybe even they didnt want to push their luck to far,Bad
3502,run run dont talk talk recent update to emails have meant that this wonderful change defaults to one of my email addresses and has lost my other two the manage existing account route doesnt work the facebook help is so slow that after hours talk talk closed at pm it runs at the rate of about messages an hour the tech line managed to get me emails on my kindle but not my pc where i need it and the nd tech call hung up my missing email addresses are vital for my work and theyve now been inaccessible for days causing me inconvenience extra costs and lost work disgraceful,Bad

3505,just cancelled my contract with virgin media after years like most providers they are to expensive for the services that i use everything sold in packs that adds up but the reason ive cancelled was the internet kept failing and virgin was unable to fix the issue on top of it on on of the calls the customer service was poor and they failed to put the call trough the manager after months of trying to fix the internet with out any luck it was clear that i had to move on,Bad

3522,first and foremost i am not a vodafone customer someone used my identity to take out a couple of contracts with vodafone despite me raising this directly with them they still felt it was appropriate to chase me for debt which i specifically asked them not to do and they agreed this has led to a negative impact on my credit rating i had a letter from the fraud team to confirm that they have identified it correctly as fraud and the contracts have been cancelled and i wouldnt need to worry anymore about it i called to complain about the impact on my credit rating and the customer services representative i spoke to was awful initially they tried to transfer me to the fraud team when i described the issue with the debt collection but the fraud team wouldnt take the call due to the manner in which the person spoke to me and their outright refusal to help i asked to speak with someone else they then lied to me telling me that their system does not allow them to transfer calls despite already trying to put me through to the fraud team i then raised a complaint through resolver which vodafone immediately undermined by setting up something on their own complaints system and tried pushing me towards they have this far refused to respond to anything on resolver the person that has been responding to me has failed to understand that my complaint is mainly about the failure of the departments ive spoken to and they are refusing to comment on it saying that i need to contact the fraud team this company is a joke and they deserve the overall star rating,Bad

3530,for a company built on communications they are now the worst in the recommend everyone to look at non landline options for their broadband ee look interesting you can get a device from them which creates a fully mobile wifi hotspot in your home or anywhere which will connect to any device in its vicinity and with the advent of g the speeds will be compatible enough for most bt cannot compete with this technology and are happy to milk all existing customers for all they can get for as long as they can bts monopoly on landlines is virtual history in the making with the cost at per month put it towards your broadband,Bad
3531,agreed to upgrade to fibre last thursday left without land line and without upgraded broadband since contacted customer services twice promised it would be working by today and isnt now being given jargon about sub contractors of no interest to me no date for return of land line or upgrade of broadband bt have not actually delivered on any commitment they have made,Bad
3532,if i could them stars i would i am on a pay monthly contract i have set up a direct debit times no and still my bill doesnt come out of my bank like it should which is probably a good thing as they are forever charging me for things i havant used or once a was late on a payment so rang to pay it and get my phone back on and when they got my money they payed the month ahead that wasnt even due yet rather then the one that was late sense i must ring them at least times a month and not once in years have i spoke to an english person which wouldnt be to bad but the people you get either dont understand you or you cant understand them and they are obviously not doing there job properly otherwise i wouldnt have so many problems i cant wait till my contract finishes so i can go elsewhere if i had the money i would just pay of my contract now worst phone contract i have ever had so much stress and phone being cut off you wouldnt believe stay clear,Bad

3535,i am an independent phone engineer on the isle of customer contacted me to complain about slow speed from his dont charge a call out so i was asked to come have a look at the internal fault proved to be an external fault because the slow speed remained with the router plugged into the test socket behind the though the customers router was relatively new talk talk insisted they send the customer a new one and wait the router gets delivered the next day and the customer who is paying per month continues to get less than returned to test the speed after the days and phoned talk talk for minutes to raise the call to they refused saying the line was to long and fibre wasnt basically thats your phoned talk talk sales department and posed as the next door neighbour who wanted to swap providers to talk was guaranteed a minimum speed of phoned talk talk to speak to a manager who might see sense and just help but no the system was downi would appear to me that the way talk talk deal with there customers is systemically wrong they were obstructive rude liars and an old age pensioner is paying a for mbps should be ashamed,Bad
3536,this broadband is just a joke and it would deserve stars if there was the possibility not even for free such a preposterous service should exist not stable so slow that if you download and upload at the same time either the download or the upload drops speed almost to zero sometimes is not even powerful enough to keep the alive with the result of losing hours uselessly its basically affecting my job badly sometimes is not even able to do the buffering for a netflix series or a youtube video and i am connected with the ethernet with my modem being just next to the tv ive never seen a broadband as bad as this anywhere in the world to be honest is it still victorian time in bts world,Bad

3565,this is the worst company ever not just worst broadband company i have had the misfortune of using talktalk twice when i have lived in shared housing both times the wifi has been appalling i have lost work days where the wifi has just not worked and the engineer cant come to fix it for days it takes so long to even get through to a real person when i called they could not put me through to the complaints department on one occasion they sent us a new router because apparently the other one was faulty i had hoped that this would solve the problem but im currently unable to load emails on top of all this our prices go up almost monthly so i have the pleasure of paying more for this crappy service to summarise they have never fixed any issues properly and they are so hard to get through to i will never ever use them again and i urge anyone who is considering to not make the mistake i did,Bad
3566,i had my talk talk router installed last month broad band speeds are less than half the minimum we have called and spoken to the call centre five times now kept on the line for minutes at a questions and promises e mails bear no fruit either the hour response to mails is a figment of someones dont get any credit for pathetic performance have been promised an engineer,Bad

3571,on signing up to virgin media we have had nothing but issues our bad experience started with incompetent workmen offering nothing but problems in the garden and being rude to our neighbours it took attempts to install the wire to our property which meant our original go live date was pushed back weeks an hour on the phone left us with no resolution and a frustrating back and forth with customer services who couldnt find a date that suited our previous supplier kept us connected until virgin media had capacity to fit us in when an engineer finally arrived to connect us to the fibre network our experience continued to be nothing but engineer was great and approached the installation with a good deal of professionalism unlike the workmen who added the cable across our property everything was set up fine however an hour or so after the connection was intermittent and we had days of internet on checking social media it seems that everyone in our area was also experiencing the same has been a common theme ever since even to the point where the outage has featured on the national news we never had any problems with our previous supplier and cannot recall a time where we had to reset the router or go without the internet a company you can spend all the money in the world on fancy advertising but when your product doesnt live up to the hype its a poor reflection of your im thoroughly disappointed and i wouldnt recommend,Bad
3572,the vodafone mobile wifi is awful we have had two different and none of them work the customer service is beyond really dont care and repeat the same rubbish everytime that they have no stock so there is nothing they can do if i could give them no stars i would embarrassingly bad customer services and awful product avoid at all costs,Bad

3576,signed up for the all inclusive package in early january with an installation date of the th february sub contractor kelly communications turned up late in the afternoon on friday th to install the cable watched them lay cables on the footpath down the street then advised the guy where they need to route the cable across my garden to the house just as it went dark i heard the operator chasing out across the footpath with a stihl saw as agreed the guy advised the installation engineer would route the cable from the junction box in the footpath outside my property to the connection point alongside my morning the installation engineer from the same company turned up at in the morning he advised that he could not complete the installation because the guy who turned up on friday should have installed the cable to the house also when we both lifted the lid on the junction box in the footpath outside my property there was no cable at all so i noted to the installation engineer i had seen them lay the cable along the ground he replied that it must have been too difficult to pull so they will have not installed it common practice apparently he then said he would contact his manager to get someone out to fit the cable and that he would not return that day because he had other installations planned so he advised his manager that another installation engineer to complete his work would be required think you might be getting the team turned up at midday and installed the cable to the connection point of my house pleased with nobody came out to complete the installation into my home and nobody advised from virgin media vm contacted them in the afternoon to be told i would get a call from their installation team within an hour can only assume all the clocks had stopped at vm as i finally got a call on the following day sunday at pm no apology was forthcoming and was told they could come to complete the installation this point i felt extremely let down and told them i expected them to rectify the issue which was of their making i told them i expected an installation engineer to complete the work the next working day monday at this point the lady i was speaking too said she would need to make further calls and would advise an alternative and hopefully an earlier installation is now late tuesday evening and after contacting them frequently to get this resolved i have not been contacted by vm all they have done is send me a text which you cannot reply too asking me to contact them on the noted number i have tried this number numerous times and on each occasion was placed hold after minutes you begin to lose the will to live never got an answer or a reply from the sunday have clearly not organised the installation as any competent company would and now they are doing absolutely nothing to resolve the can only reiterate what others have said and avoid this bunch of jokers at all cost i think star is too good and would give a lower score if vm at all costs and learn from my foolishness thinking i would get a reasonable service,Bad

3579,i would give a zero if i could oh my days me and my other half have spent about hours overall ringing up to sort an issue with o via phone and live chat it would take too long to explain what went on but cut a long story short an issue that couldve been sorted at a fraction of the time took so so long we were so frustrated the amount of times we had to explain our situation because the cs team dont communicate or seem to leave notes we were told at one point that a manager would call us back after we requested we were told wed be called within hours days later no call so we had to ring back i feel sorry for anyone who works for o they try to be polite but they just dont resolve issues or know fully what they are on about we got told different things by different advisors about the same thing definitely one of the worst customer service experiences ive had avoid,Bad

3587,we were with virgin media for many years and ntl before lately however probably since takeover by liberty global their tactics of fleecing customers at every opportunity became too much i asked them times to move us to current tariff for new customers to save off the bill and get double peak data rate no special promotion deals just the same regular monthly amount a new customer would pay after a while virgin media consistently refused then started ignoring my requests as a result we now switched phone broadband and all our mobiles to talktalk saving over month however the matter does not end there i phoned virgin yesterday to ask about a refund of outstanding balance i had line rental paid for full year and only used months of it and i was told i will be sent by cheque and no further payments are needed so i cancelled vm direct debit only to receive another call from vm in the evening offering me to generously reset my account balance to even though i cancelled my direct debit i refused demanded to see the final bill after which apparently an executive director customer care emailed me a bill charging me for an extra month of broadband and not mentioning the months of line rental to be refunded i am still in the process of disputing this bill will take it to court if necessary but you can see that these people are only after one thing and it isnt good customer experience avoid avoid avoid,Bad

3619,brave of them to complaints throughout the length of the contract so far for a variety of reasons ranging from what was promised in bundle when we signed up vs what was actually provided errors on bill when nothing has changed drop is speeds drop in coverage repeated attempts to resolve successfully failed callbacks dropped calls and chats when agents realise its a complaint or complicated drop outs in coverage self help is poor send you around in circles without helping you escalate the matter cant wait to leave,Bad

3633,i advise you not to use virgin media for broadband or calls or tv they are a nightmare i have had a terrible experience with them if you have an account with them and then decide to close the account they do not update your credit file so even if you was in arrears and cleared them they do not update experian and equifax you have to do all the leg work in addition they mess your credit file report very badly your points will significantly reduce given you lower credit i paid my bill and decided that i might continue using them however when thy decided to do a credit search in my name for a particular package deal it went down on my credit file as a hard search and i lost alot of points they do not carry out soft searches they do and it really messes with your credit my advise would be to avoid virgin media like the i called collections to ask them why does my bill remains as unpaid when it has been paid they apologised and said i must write a email to their credit file address so they can look into it i paid a tesco contract bill the same day i paid virgin actually straightaway after i paid virgin tesco immediately informed my bill was paid and it shows clear on my credit file with experian with virgin media its a whole diffrent scenario they did not even update thir systems so i asked to speak to collections and they confirmed after much digging that yes the bill is paid th previous worker not in collection sent me bill which was already paid for and thats when i new i had to speak to collections the time now pm and i have been haggling with virgin since pm i am exhausted and dont find them worth it advise go elsewhere,Bad
3634,ill summarise the reasons of my frustration with customer service cs mentioning issues one about connectivity lag the other about frequent router cs agent insists with two speed connections while i insist ive got no speed related issues during the process they manage to factory reset my router yes without any warning all my settings lost reconnecting with cs agent who is only able to see of the conversation i had with cs agent they also read that i have a speed ended up with not solving either of my problems lost hour and lost all my router settings thanks talktalk brilliant karl who responded and yes they wont allow a reply therefore i edit my you answered how much attention did you actually pay reading my message speed issues didnt i explicitly say that both my issues are not speed related,Bad

3678,my experience with virgin as new customer has been appalling i subscribed over month ago installation date was postponed times since without explanation and new date postponed in days customer services are blaming other departments but cannot provide any explanations the only short term solution offered to get internet is for me to subscribe to a mobile wifi and pay upfront for this in addition to my initial service virgin media is the absolute opposite of customer obsession and to avoid at all cost,Bad

3695,my wife and i moved into a new rental property so first priority once we settled was the utilities everything was pay as you go but we needed a land line so good old trusty bt seemed the obvious choice money paid via dd landline was already installed so all they had to do was switch us on yes fully working land line on a family and friends package but we started getting asking for mr so sometimes calling him by first name sorry wrong number the penny dropped when letters started coming in addressed to mr so and so bt hadnt given us a new number they reactivated the previous tenants number plus they were charging for direct debit payments we put up with it and once the months were up we canceled the dd but the customer services insisted we owed them for cancellation of the services or something i checked ofcom nope we owe nothing so cut the line and go to hell hours later an asian lady phoned claiming we were owed cash back from overpaying on our bt account i heard my wife on the phone to her she came into the living room to get her purse whats that about bt owes us but needs the bank account details i took the purse off her and hung the phone up bad enough bt ripped us off but now our details are in the hands of scammers two hours after we canceled the dd coincidence i dont think so,Bad

3697,i requested broadband towards the end of november which failed to arrive talk talk sent a router which was of no use without being connected to a phone line so a poor show from the out set contacted them about this and gave them one last chance of hooking me sent an engineer who was unable to connect to the several phone line connections in and around my that was that i called up to cancel the account having established that talk talk were not going to be the service provider for me and no harm done because id cancelled within the day cooling off period incurring no costs right wrong the talk talk representative had clarified that the account had been closed to me on the phone but for some reason it remained i called up again and cancelled it again still within the cooling off period which im told is actually days as opposed to the operative clearly stated the account was now closed and inactive i thought nothing of it going back to my day i get an email stating that my bill was now due from talk talk honestly i wasnt that surprised because of my previous dealings with them but it was just pure cheek they know they failed to provide a service they know i cancelled the account before owing left the account active to run up a bill against my request and average person would be arrested for fraud deception and attempting to obtain funds through deception for this kind of behaviour so last week th jan or so i spent over and hour and a half speaking to them and being passed around departments in an attempt to finally get this account closed eventually they agreed to close down the account for the third time with no charge admitting that they had initially failed to not only provide a service but close down the account when first said it would take days and i would have a confirmation email confirmation email never arrived days later the bill now stands at you will not get a penny tried that karl didnt work,Bad
3698,i was a mobile customer of vodafone for years over the last two years i was left annoyed infuriated and disappointed for a variety of service do not about price changes even though i specifically asked months earlier if it would change at all no was the dept offer at more expensive prices than for new customers can go on but i am boring myself in the end it actually felt that they were trying to force me out by annoying me persistently it worked so they do that well star for that in response to their how a loyal customer is offered a worse deal than a new customer its laughable,Bad
3699,third review in order to stop virgin media answering m with things everyone already knows which are most annoying and unhelpful what i suggest is that they join me in a conversation with one of their so called support team next time and time how long it takes to get through and then the awful rudeness and utter intransigence from the team finally second visit from technicians on friday to finish the job the last one left unfinished,Bad
3700,had the worst experience ordered a phone and did a downpayment of pounds after miscommunication about delivering i stayed home an entire night the next night they should have came again this time they couldnt find my house and would send the phone back to the office which will take days after that they can resend it again at this time i cancelled it all and wanted my money back they said i could only cancel when the phone was back in the office after those days so days later i cancel and ask for my money back they said yes i can do that but call again on monday to confirm if it went through all right this was on a saturday and the guy on the phoned sounded stoned and was laughing the entire time my situation was not funny at all he also asked me if i could hold on so he could speak to his friend who walked in monday i called again and they said it worked out well and the money will be transferred but call next week on tuesday if the money isnt there they refunded pounds and the remaining wasnt processed the previous time so they are telling me right now they will do it again and it will again take to days but if that wasnt enough yesterday they took out the first payment for my pay monthly and for my phone which i never got which is also pounds so now they will transfer back the the pounds took more than a month spoke to people on the phone over times and hours and chatted to people over hours as well this is the worst service i ever experienced from any company and i still not know if next week it will finally be fixed,Bad

3703,hello unfortunately i am extremely disappointed with my experience with you two regarding my phone which i sent off to repair as it would not turn on at all the staff at ee in islington were helpful by sending it off and lending me a loan phone i was happy with my ability to track my phones repair and received an email saying it was ready for collection but when i got back to ee it was not repaired at all due to water damage one my phone had no contact with water prior to this and secondly i did not have to wait two weeks to find this out instead i had to buy another phone which i could have done anyway had i known it was unable to be repaired instead of wasting my time and money they did not even let me buy a replacement phone or offer me any compensation for example some phones were with a contract but to buy and as i have a contract already no body offered to sell a phone to be at the cheaper price to compensate my waste of money and time,Bad
3704,internet services have been dropping in and out intermittently for years every now and then it is worse and i lose connection for hours i have tried several times to call and discuss this with virgin only to be provided complaint links that go to blank pages or do not exist my only other option has been to sit on hold for literally hours to be told there is nothing wrong by a robot or passed around until i get cut off virgin i implore you not to give a standard template response to this complaint and actually engage with a customer,Bad
3705,awful very very unreliable internet they overcharged me for my contract and refused to refund me it then took over hours being bounced around phone departments just to cancel the contract after they messed me around avoid at all costs you literally could not pay me to go back to them,Bad
3706,obviously wont allow to rank them as its a given that they never ever answer the phone apparently due to really factor in the worst indian call centre staff imaginable lie to customer to get them off the line cut customer off of cant resolve the issue a text service not fit for purpose imagine previously mentioned awful indian call service agents hiding behind an sms broadband is down you know its down everybody in your street knows its down no known issues in your to mention but the response from virgin reminded me constantly trying to get you off hold by suggesting you may want to use their useless text service or go onto a forum full of dissatisfied customers venting about how nobody answers the calls,Bad
3707,sat waiting for a long time for the call to be answered hung up,Bad
3708,very poor response when i tried to end my contract on my expiry was owed a credit from mobile dept but the was more interested in transferring me to mobile dept instead of sorting out my contract,Bad

3741,after many calls and false promises of a better and more frequent less interrupted service we opted for an upgrade we then experienced an even worse service and we were advised to have boosters at a monthly cost we were then told apx months ago these boosters were out of stock and we would be notified when they will be ready for delivery when i quizzed the representative if i could simply purchase generic boosters to help the connectivity she advised me there was no guarantee of these working due to them being produced from a non virgin truly believe this is mostly fiction and i would like some explanation to why we have repeatedly had a degrading service over the past many years as a loyal thanks adrian,Bad
3742,its really bad company im with then for almost months honestly worst in uk really bad service,Bad
3743,suddenly went from paying my usual contract amount of around a month to being charged several hundred pounds at first i assumed it was an honest mistake and contacted customer service but they refused to refund the amount they stole saying that it was for services that i had neither asked for nor received spent months fighting to try to get answers and my money back but they just kept repeating that i was charged the correct amount while refusing to give any more details then eventually just ignored further communications of course i switched to another provider asap and now i pay per month and have an infinitely better package along with superior customer service but how could it be worse compared to what ee wanted to charge almost a month for in conclusion avoid ee they add on expensive extras that you dont need dont use and dont ask for direct debits are dangerous as your bank account is turned into their own personal piggy bank with all their unauthorised charges and to add insult to injury they will ignore you and refuse to give any details concerning all their mysterious charges big companies can get away with murder an expensive lesson,Bad
3744,now i know why they are called talktalk all they do is natter on and on and offer no assistance to your problem they leave you on hold for copious amounts of time and then hang up on you the rest of the time they are as clueless as i am when it comes to resolving a wifi issue this is by far the worst internet provider i live in a small flat but only have bar of signal around the talktalk says im on the best package ridiculous all they ever do is tell you to monitor your issue but never resolve it how can a company be so useless so much so that my partner has wasted hours over multiple days on a call with them all those calls and still no solution funny thing is my partner managed to resolve the issue herself and shes no it expert talktalk you really need to reconsider the training of your staff and your prices as this ludicrous service is not worth the amount you wow talktalk a speedy reply oh wait its generic that does not even refer to any aspect of my review surprised you didnt ask me to monitor my issue and see if it resolves itself,Bad
3745,i wanted to address this message to talktalk company and its team i cannot express in words how disappointed i am and angry to talktalk my auntie left uk ago and contacted talktalk to terminate the agreement then she noticed that the company is still charging for their services she tried to call wrote the letters emailed had live chat and each time the team members just cut her off or didnt do anything a week ago she contacted me all in tears saying that all her pension is gone to talktalk to pay their fees and late payment charges bear in mind my aunt is years old i said i will help you i called i message i had a live chat and each time we closer to the cancellation procedure the gen just cut me off i chatted with of talktalk agents today and called several times each time person put me in hold and i waited for minutes and at the end i was cut offi am starting to think is talktalk a scam company where the customer is not heard i hope that someone from management will contact me to sort this issue otherwise we will have to go further with this issue,Bad

3749,the most dreadful customer service i have ever come across for a broadband provider and thats saying only does their broadband service goes down randomly with any notification and any response or resolution timeframe they never answer their phones and divert you to a terrible whatsapp chat where they ask many market research questions and delay addressing one simplest request its common to end up there for days before someone addresses ones request and then when one had enough and decide to cancel they hold you in a waiting group for days so they can charge you more money for a service one longer,Bad
3750,pay for an expensive broadband deal at mbps their contract says minimum speed guaranteed normal speed actually delivered mbps on average its quarter of whats advertised i had put up with this for a year now but now enough is enough they dont fix your issue they say they will but never do they just ignore you all facts,Bad
3751,got slow speeds completed all checks virgin media ask for such as resetting router and checking connections i completed a speed test on the speed test app for windows connected via cata ethernet just like it asks to to im getting mbps when i meant to be getting mbps ive tried and tried to contact them and their webchat dont respond for days their website doesnt allow you to report slow speeds faults yourself and their phone lines have ridiculous queues its honestly atrocious,Bad

3801,hi p thanks for taking the time to leave a review although i am sorry to hear youre still waiting on a refund the way the refund is processed depends on what its for aswell as what was selected when you disconnected your service if youre still waiting on your cheque the teams would raise this and then the refunds department will then resent the cheque this can only be done once every days though if its been more than days then please give the team another call for them to check this for you you can reach them on kath,Bad

3821,internet keeps dipping out if we switch off and on to resolve as advised by virgin media then the service becomes unusable for one to two calling however i stand more chance of speaking to the pope than talking to an advisor due to ridiculous waiting times i tend to hang up after an hour on making a complaint and had no response tried cancelling however phone advised to message tried messaging which advised me to call on the point of simply cancelling my payments and awaiting a call from their team to ask why,Bad
3822,my response to vodafone not computer generated but real true feelings thanks for nothing vodafone usual generated response from you just like all the scripts that are read out be it by phone or chat line that i have endured over many days as i do not have twitter or facebook accounts its impossible for me to contact the social media team i think it would be a complete waste of time anyway as you vodafone hide behind generated answers scripts with no real human interest in your loyal customers who have been with you for a long time thank goodness ive left even though it has cost me money to do not be like on you perhaps the would have something to say but do you know what you are not worth my time and rid of you thank goodness,Bad

3842,i joined talk talk on the th january i moved after being with bt for years with very few problems and a reliable internet service through i moved because talk talk offered full fibre at a good price and it was cheaper than bt i was wrong to move and was blinded by the i moved ive had ongoing problems with my wifi connection it constantly cuts out daily mostly in the afternoon when im working i am sat beside the router and it doesnt make any difference it cuts for hours and i have no connection i call or chat to customer service and it takes so long to be put through and explain the problem to someone that understands my issue im kept waiting excessively and it is never fixed it is a waste of my time and there is no other way to report problems with anyone that knows what they are talking about the tech team lacks knowledge and tells me its fixed however they can not tell me what the problem was or what they did to fix it i am told the work is done by the back office amd they dont have the info every time i report it they run line tests and i get an email saying its fixed then the next day i have the same problem and internet drops againi think and it appears to me that talk talk can offer a low price due to cutting costs in customers services and training for staff and by providing a poor service clearly not what i signed up to leave and go back to advice is avoid this company or be prepared to get a poor service,Bad
3843,well o i will not be renewing my contract with for the phones i have to me i have put up with you putting up every year by some amount maybe you can tell us what you have improves yo the increase we know you need it to pay the ceo but inm a cost of living you raise but the service has no improvements think it time clamped down on this poor company mind dont help when they have a conning company like virgin with avoid best just have a home phone,Bad

3850,wanted to switch to zen not sure which package asked to start on say mb but asked if i can upgrade later but apparently that would mean cancelling my contract and being fined couldnt care less attitude from sales staff gone for your message what you have written is not what the salesperson said i have provided the additional information you have requested but still nobody can be bothered to contact me i am now reviewing my business account with zen based on the lack of response requested to upgrade connection to full fibre for my business premises about weeks ago promised an answer in days still no response will be moving business account asap no time for time wasters rating downgraded to mails offering to contact me over the past weeks but still nobody bothered to call disappointing,Bad
3851,on saturday we contacted virgin regarding our contract coming to an end we were connected to a customer service guy who was not listening to our preferences continued to be very vague with prices etc at this point my wife ended the call she then rang up again got through to a chap who started off okay but again as the conversation went on about the price etc my wife wanted to discuss it with myself husband son to this he then said i can hear the on your shoulder at this point i was furious that a customer service employee would say such a thing again we ended the call only then to receive an email saying thanks here is your new contract which at no point did we agree to anything we would like a senior manager to contact us directly asap,Bad
3852,unhelpful will not listen if you have an issue i request to keep my old number sent the pac number to them they said it failed but instead of contacting me they just ignored it im know trying to cancel the account but again having problems would not recommend this company i have been cut hours yesterday on the phone,Bad
3853,gave another go due to my current contract ending in the hope it was more stable since i was last a customer upon joining noticed i was getting mb g speeds at home so to rule it out i tried a at work this was in a total different area and yet i got a similar result i then tested it elsewhere on my travels mb was the max i got contacted an agent followed all the advice despite it being scripted and not useful and still the blame was put back on me so within the same month left them and now get full g service with ee not this so called g service they advertise either over subscribed or they are desperately trying to keep costs down at the customers expense absolutely pathetic,Bad
3854,quite frankly the worst company i have ever had to interact with for a communications company they are unbelievably difficult to communicate with the left hand never knows what the right hand is doing,Bad
3855,despicable customer service manager call backs never appear argumentative and can only respond with preempted replys then soon as you get upset because they are not listening they threaten to disconnect the call,Bad
3856,i have just rejoined ee in a mobile contract and it was the worst decision ive made in a long time they have wasted a massive amount of my time this week with their incompetence the customer service is unorganised and therefore unhelpful theyre obviously not training staff properly the people at complaints are probably the best at their job but that says something about the company in itself,Bad
3857,do not join virgin media they are rude unhelpful and their service is have not had broadband for days now and there is no resolution in try to get updates on when it will be up and running and they just say theyre a major fault with the cable in the area and their engineers are working on it its ridiculous they do not offer us any compensation for the inconvenience or for the fact that we have been forced to buy extra data on our mobiles which is expeditiously broadband means no tv on demand do we are paying for half a tv service we complain that do not even attempt to refund you for three days with out service even though there aware of the fact theyre charging you for a service youre not of our homes appliances run off wifi our home alarm sump pump alarm bell you name a few its not are trapped with virgin in a contract for months we are continuously having problems with their services they even have an automated voice message when you call their phone line apologising for the fault in your area more lies as sometimes there isnt a fault sometimes theyve just over charged us or put fees on which we are told would not be applied i hate to think how many customers get ripped off because they do not have time to go through their bill and just trust trust that theyre being charged choose another company one that values their customers and one that provides a service and doesnt just charge for it even when its down half the so we had no internet for days before it was finally resolved according to the engineer it was virgin media who cut it off in the first place they were supposed to leave a leaflet through the door to notify us they didnt also why didnt someone from virgin tell us this when we asked a million times they just knowing the problem you make matters worse theyve just increased our monthly bill by we only just joined and are supposed to be in a contract for months for what i thought was am agreed set amount apparently they increase the bills annually and do not care what your contract days be very wary before getting involved with this country who is going downhill fast,Bad

3887,after making numerous fruitless complaints about my elderly mothers landline and broadband not working i helped my mother to discontinue her contract with bt we returned bts kit as requested using their tracked returns label immediately nevertheless bt pestered my mother to return their kit or pay a fee for it they also continued to pester my mother with notification of increasing charges after her contract had people are terrible you cannot even report a fault to them without giving the date and amount of your latest bill and the date the bill was paid they claim this is for data protection reasons but will not say what data they are trying to protect it seems to be more of a delaying tactic to try to get customers to give up i would not recommend this company to have been communicating with their customer services staff for over months now and they are consistently unhelpful unreliable and generally difficult,Bad
3888,absolutely rubbish so rubbish that i have to swap to my mobile data to leave this review it constantly drops out and needs a reset and when you get away without resetting it buffers up load speed is non existent i would strongly recommend a different provider my year old blames me for choosing the worst internet because he cant stay in a game shocking connectivity my so call deal is for just broadband i suppose the saying is right you get what you pay for my advice is have a look around ask friends and family about the packages they have this close to christmas theres some great offers ive just found a tv and fibre deal for months low fixed price up and running in weeks,Bad

3896,they use to sign up customers on its behalf and then try to disassociate themselves with the dishonest practices at they promise gift vouchers after a qualifying period and then completely ignore any communication a complete con vodafone are clearly aware of the number of complaints online but continue to work with them a complete lack of responsibility and integrity at vodafone,Bad
3897,offer pretty poor value tried to convince me they were a better provider as they offered shorter contracts but this makes no sense when you can get month by month deals from other providers for a fraction of the price and without the inflated setup cost they seem to benefit off the situation short term renters find themselves in and its just shady as all obviously they dont want to discuss things like this on a public forum,Bad
3898,i put onto my account for my next top up i got the text from ee and it was taken out of my bank account the next morning i got a text from ee stating i do not have enough money on my account i only have so i went on to call ee not knowing and was not warned that charges apply when i checked at the end of the call i had even less than i originally had these crooks charged me for a call and i ended up loosing money in the end and had to purchase a pack i paid my correct amount the first day and ended up with less due to a company with a bunch of crooks do not use ee or tmobile i have ee and had tmobile awful companies just taking your hard money and do not i repeat do not call any of their costumer service numbers its not costumer service its you giving your money to them this company is a scam and i will terminate my account next month and warn everyone i know and people online about their ways,Bad

3903,for three months the internet barely worked most days it worked for half the day when they were not doing works customer service is appallingly arrogant and says that that means that the internet works i pay per month but virgin has not kept its end of the contract they expect their customers to have no internet while the same customers are meant to be working from to say not staying with virgin,Bad

3985,connection drops all the time so many zoom meetings where i had to apologise because of internet have to reset router constant speed router is not the best and has lots of issues if theres a neighbor with virgin too got tired of complaining website redirects always to theres ongoing work in your area well if theres ongoing work why is it just as horrible as it was a year since i cant reply to your message emma thank you for your response wifi is only one of my issues ive used appropriate wifi scanners to confirm no overlapping channels ive also tried the router in different areas same connection drops are primarily at source so can be seen if i am wired in directly as per tv and in office the self help does its checks and so not find an issue as they are not consistent and vary in time of day and length of connection outage i could go into more technical details about how ping rates or routes play an think ill leave that out for now the annoying part is that online checks support regularly say theres work in your area,Bad
3986,after many many years with we noticed the deals for loyal customers werent there so decided to change rather than go online sign up and take ms vouchers i spoke to customer services as i was a little nervous about making the change and wanted to be sure all the services would meet our families requirements the sales side was great ordered infinity package with extra box bt sports came free phone and broadband i was told we could upgrade our subscriptions to sky sports movies etc if we needed to later on family are big footy fans and sky sports is very important i was also told the broadband was superior and would more than cover the many wifi gadgets in the house family of ipads phones etc etc engineer was great set up fee and all looked rosy after a few days absence of sky sports became noticeable kids and husband very miserable as i was informed i could subscribe to sky sports at anytime i phoned to get sports on for per being passed onto different departments in different countries i was told no you cant have sky sports because you have an extra box this was the day before the manchester derby so desperation frustration was setting in i tried again another department said yes and then after minutes going backwards and forwards to a manager she said no you cant have sky sports because you have an extra box why i asked the response was basically you cant why why why if all they could offer was to watch sky sports on one box i was happy with that but i cant have sky sports because i have an extra i had been informed of this when being sold the package i would not have gone with bt as i require an extra box and sky sports to keep the family with bt broadband for the past week has been a nightmare regular drops in service has left all of us very frustrated home working and kids doing homework is a nightmare watching tv on our nd box is a joke and kids facetime and xbox activities interrupted has left us all feeling very cheated i have raised this with customer services the drops in service is normal i dont think thats good enough someone is listening to the sales call to determine whether i wished to have sky sports i most certainly did as this is such a huge family requirement ill have to wait and see what happens with that one i was told i was within my day rights to cancel period but i am concerned that bts investigations will take me out of that i am so disappointed,Bad

3990,virgin media claimed that i had missed a payment i sent bank statements proving otherwise virgin media stalled and avoided till the point we are in deadlock and it will be settled by a third example of virgin media despite having bank statements as evidence the customer is always staff including managers are all rude and couldnt care for the customer takes literal weeks for a manger to call this was a simple problem that could have been solved easily but yet virgin medias incompetence is what escalated the media also done a fake reply to this post below we are in deadlock virgin media refuse to talk to us about the issue the fake reply is an attempt to look good dont be fooled,Bad

3993,im not impressed by the bullying tactics from from ee having excellent customer services isnt an offer for days it should be something ee should want to demonstrate as a company ee shouldnt be attempting to buy me out but instead have the customers complaint at the forefront so you can actually respond with some knowledge of this case what you have put in your email below is not accurate ee should be working to make improvements to their services i am receiving conflicting messages that are borderline harassing when my ee contract rolled over in october i was assured that this issue would be resolved i have had issues with no connection and drops in connection for several months regrettably this issue has emerged again and unfortunately i cannot agree that this is an adequate service i rang ee on to ask where i could find information on your website or the email to ee complaints i spoke to an agent who was very uncooperative he refused to give me any information on how i could make a complaint unless i verified my account i did not want to access my account nor did i want to make a complaint on the phone all i asked was for the complaints procedure to be explained to me he continued to explain that he could not help me further because i had not verified my account with him i then asked him if you he could put me on the phone to his manager after being put on hold he came back on the phone to explain that his manager had refused to speak to me because she needed me to first verify my account to philip i am very disappointed in the conduct of ee during this call ee should be able to provide general information to anyone who calls ee whether theyre a customer or not the question i was asking would fit under general enquiries and has nothing to do with account information when i found ees number online there is nothing to suggest that ee will refuse enquiries from non ee customers in fact it states that youre on hand to help i expect call agents whether broadband phone or general enquiries line to use their initiative when handling calls this is unsatisfactory behaviour from ee after several attempts i finally made contact with a manager at ee i informed her of the issues that had arose on and my overall issues with ee customer services and my broadband i was informed that she would advise me further once an engineer came to visit my property and she provided me with her number and email address despite this promise i still was still without broadband services at my property likewise i had not heard back as promised consequently i emailed the manager to follow up,Bad

3997,the only reason i give this company one star is because its not possible to give zero our broadband is down again their service status for this area is showing everything is ok but their phone message says that repairs in this area are taking a little longer than usual after wading through a list of phone options i finally managed to find a person to talk to in india to be told that the repairs wouldnt be complete until th feb thats a week offline and i use the internet for my work ive been chewing through my mobile data allowance for important traffic but virgin show total disinterest in should show more interest in whats happening with the company he heads rather than interfering and pontificating on brexit,Bad
3998,i moved from vodafone back in november due to not getting a great signal at my home but not knowing o share the most of the same network masts my home signal problems are now far worse than ever before and o deny all knowledge to make matters worst out of shops i have visited to try speak about these issues the staff are too busy texting or playing with their mobile phone to listen to what you have to say horrible experience so far with this company and cant wait for my months to finish they deny all knowledge that network issues exist in my area and as for customer service all they speak about how the won best customer service satisfaction award last year well things have taken a massive turn is all i am saying i am not by any means saying i had a great experience with vodafone but at least the staff are helpful and not rude g is all a complete joke i work glasgow city centre and can honestly say the g is almost as slow as g vodafone and ee are at least twice as fast from my experience o staff are great when they hear the words new contract then you walk in a store as a customer and they are not interested horrible company,Bad
3999,terrible company besides them giving me high bills by mistake they also routinely increase the price so my original deal was a month for basic internet it rose to then and then when it got to i called them they ended up disconnecting me by mistake and the next bill was instead of the we had agreed eventually they reconnected me later i had weeks with very slow internet and then a weekend with no internet at all so i called them again every call goes through to india to someone who is hard to understand and they also cant help you with anything they just have a basic script of things to say like have you tried turning it off and back on they will also try to blame the customer for everything so you have to use their terrible hardware or they wont support you if you get a better router they wont help there is never any warning of outages and when i call they say they will do a test and they get back and say everything is fine even though it isnt one time they wrote to me to say they had discovered a fault in the nearby box and would fix it soon but the other several times i have had outages they deny all responsibility after the last outages i made a formal complaint and a week later i was called at am on a saturday morning which woke me up an indian lady asked if the problem was fixed now which it was so she closed the complaint but i was complaining because of having no internet for a week and terrible support and service but i would have to make the complaint again and it is just too much hassle i am now paying for mbit connection and today i am getting half a i cant even get my emails this has been going on for a few days and i dread to even call them because they always say there is nothing wrong and they insist i restart the modem and router which i have already done twice and i dont like having to get on the floor to reset them again my parents also have virgin media at their house and they have all the exact same problems constantly rising bills wrong bills internet outages and terrible customer support in fact my parents are elderly and a bit slow to deal with things so at one point they were paying a month to virgin media so i had to get involved and get the price down to they are truly horrible i need to find some other company,Bad

4012,after an hour and minutes the issue is not sorted we did everything asked of us and then the agent ended the chat without letting me know,Bad
4013,signals is the best out of the ones i have tried broad band could be a little better customer services stores support upgrades second to none update minus stars the wifi became to expensive there were drop outs when i switched providers i cancelled and they still charged me a full month when i finished around days early so beware this must be a well known and common scam as my new provider also did the same and added days onto my billing for no reason so buyer beware without adding the coupons on compare the market,Bad

4018,i contacted talktalk with a view to cancelling my contract the customer advisor suggested that they could do me a deal that would keep me as a customer but the best they could offer wasnt even as good as the cheapest deal on talk website for the same package my opinion of talk customer service was a a real low before this call and frankly this experience has convinced me to leave talk talk they may be cheap but customer service is non existent,Bad
4019,i left my purchases in the basket and sent an email asking who they used to deliver this was because hermes or whatever they are calling keep the products or dump them in hedgerows following day no response to my question and the cost of the telephones had been raised by we are in an isolated area with no mobile signal and because of severe health issues we are reliant on landline i was left with no alternative but to pay the extra money i did manage to speak to someone and was told that this was quite normal for this to the phones are not worth the money,Bad

4021,signed up for new month tariff at per month within two months was increased to due to rpi despite no mention of pending increase during sign up following my complaint the uneducated response was as a company we must treat all of our customers equally to ensure that everyone is treat fairly no changes will be made and no gestures offered judging by the comments on this site at least the statement above seems true they treat everyone like october after appallingly poor connectivity during august and september with speeds on g faster than on g they agreed to cancel my contract,Bad
4022,i have had problems with billing and was not happy with the result i never got any of the promised boosts that were meant to be free when joining o and every time i rang customer services they were very dismissive and would not listen to what i was saying it was like talking to a robot reading from a script,Bad

4029,my experience with this company is terrible we had problems for the full length of time we were with the company we took it to an ombudsman and eventually they agreed to cease the contract i had taken this in writing and actual asked for a print out for their system which is just as well now they are have charged me for some time after then put me on to debt collection agent in fact they are still due us money i with the livingston branch whom were actually very helpful although they received no back up from head office to get things done problems that we had at the time is wrong billing wrong name on systems problems with signal we later fund out that vodafone had not paid the bills for the hosting of the satellites we had phones as we run a business we are still trying to get this sorted years later think that more should be done about this sort of thing this is bullying and harassment ks,Bad
4030,i had been with talktalk for years and always paid my bills this year in july i was placed in refugee due to domestic violence and have been there ever contract was supposed to end in august so i didnt worry to much and was expecting the last bill i called them to make sure my contract was ending and they agreed it was and it also still states the end date on my online right now but they are still billing me monthly for a disconnected services and will not credit score is now impacted and everyone i speak to is so unhelpful and the service is awful considering the actual time i was with this company,Bad
4031,after purchasing a new iphone mini and told there was months free airtime which one would take advantage of only to find i had been mis sold by the o shop falmouth only after countless calls to customer services did i finally get the right result with a lady called debbie many thanks to her after going round in circles and speaking to an african call centre which were absolutely should not give up and be put off which does seem to be what want when purchasing a new phone be aware and do not be mis led as i would also have been charged for many months if i had not double checked my account each being with for fifteen years i am extremely disappointed there needs to be some serious investigations into their customer care and selling new devices with free airtime which is not honoured,Bad
4032,worst company on this planet theyve messed us around so much theyve cancelled on us time now and have even lied about connecting our house up when not even coming to the should be ashamed of themselves and im not surprised they have so many bad reviews,Bad

4034,months into a year contact so far they have increased the price by called and told them this is now too expensive but they say there is nothing they can do asked if i could downgrade my package to bring the costs down and they cant do that either feel like i have been completely ripped off do not join bt broadband they offer a good intro deal but then they raise the monthly price as much as they like within the initial contract period price increase in months is outrageous,Bad

4036,they made it extremely difficult for me to cancel my contract following an email from them advising of a price increase from may i was absolutely appalled by the customer service received from their agent stari received an email from virgin media advising me of the price increase and the right to cancel should i wish to when i told star i wanted to cancel not only because of the price increase but because my internet connection had been poor over the past several months she said that the email had never been sent to me so i didnt have the right to cancel when i told her that i have the email she tried to then deter me from cancelling as much as possible and placed me on hold several times to speak to management to see if i have the right to cancel i have anxiety and she flared it up with the way she handled my call really poor customer service,Bad
4037,i so wish i had looked at the rest of these reviews before i put my broadband order in i had my installed on th oct on the same day my dsl was disconnected i have called the support line umpteen times and been through the with each adviser as if it the first time i have reported the issue the router and fibre box has been rebooted more times than i have had hot dinners and no one seems to understand the fault which i keep telling them as my gateway hub is saying no ipv i have no idea what this is but as an isp id have thought vodafone would knowi have been without internet since the th oct had to pay for a plumber to take out my wifi heating system and replace with a non smart one so i could get some hot water this is disgusting service they have said i should have service by wednesday all i can say is if i dont i will be cancelling the contract with them absolute car crash,Bad
4038,i took out a broadband contract with talktalk in december since installation not a week went by when i didnt have to check why i had no broadband call technical support only to be told there was nothing wrong with the service or reboot in the end i had to increase my data allowance i gave notice to talktalk in september and have had to pay them to get out of the contract as i hated the service i was getting just awful i have since joined virgin media and the service has not dropped at all just brilliant compared to talktalk,Bad
4039,i can honestly say the worst customer service ive ever had please please please do not use them calls and over hours on hold they just dont answer the phone how anyone can actually work there i really dont know they must spend the whole day dealing with complaints just do yourself a favour and dont use virgin,Bad
4040,what a crap company terrible broadband signal they try to sell you boosters to make their millions in profit stretch promise lightening fast fibre and give me a shocking service when you ring them you are put through to an indian sweat shop probably in the depths of calcutta who have no idea how to sort out your on you branson sitting in your plush mansion on your opulent island whilst you pay your workers your act together and stop telling people you promise the earth and give them a company,Bad
4041,most recent,Bad
4042,talktalk dont care about their loyal customers at all and think that they can just delete customers email data without authorisation or contacting the user beforehand and when support are contacted about the deletion and told to recover the data from their backups or disaster recovery copies they say that the data no longer exists anywhere how about that for a paid service customers in response to the comment from emma at talktalk what happened emma is that i discovered that my email accounts had been arbitrarily deleted by talktalk support without contacting me to discuss when i found out that they had been deleted i demanded that they be restored immediately only to be told that this was not possible as no backup had been taken before the deletion and i got no satisfactory answer when i asked why then asked for them to be restored from themost recent backup before the deletions only to be told that no such backup existed again no response to asking why whole process took several months to get nowhere and at several times during my attempts to get this resolved i was lied to by the support staff finally talktalk do charged for email as its an important integral part of the service that i have been paying for each can you explain the bizarre link you posted as i find nothing funny at all about how i have been treated by talktalk,Bad
4043,stay away from this company not only did they take a unauthorised payment from my dads card they also renewed my contract without my knowledge or authorisation and when i spoke to them they told me we have our money so we dont care and when i asked them why they renewed without my knowledge their response was we are not obliged to tell you so live with it needless to say im taking this further and am cancelling my contract,Bad
4044,unfortunately i have never experienced such a poor customer service as that with talktalk my complaints and explanations eventually caused me to close my account even though human beings have acknowledged my account is closed and there is nothing to pay i still get monthly emails saying i have to pay and then chasing letters each time i speak to a human they blame an automated system that they cant change ha im feed up with calling them to more go away,Bad
4045,avoid this its simply unprofessional the installation was postponed for over a month before i decided to cancel the order i live in cambridge centre so i doubt the location is a problem when i tried to get in touch to cancel the order i had to spend more than an hour and communicate the problem to people before they asked to contact hr later to check if they can cancel the account it is simple the worst service i have experience in the uk i hope i dont have to waste any more time with them,Bad
4046,i really feel compelled to give a review of the service level i have so far endured from tesco mobile my coworker and i both had our devices stolen from our workplace i reported my device stolen to tesco mobile and was informed by their team that the imei located as used with my sim card was invalid they said they had never seen that happen before and sought manager advise i was told i needed to provide a proof of purchase of the device and then tesco mobile would add the imei to the blacklist i provided the proof of purchase and was hoping to get it all sorted i contacted their phone support today only to be told that they decided not to blacklist my phone they said that the company i bought the phone from had now gone into liquidation proceedings i also checked and the site that i bought the device has now been taken down so it looks like that is correct i really do not feel that is in any way fair to me tesco system did not store my imei and my purchase proof is no good as the company has gone bust it seems like i am being deprived of help through nothing to do with anything that is my own fault i genuinely believe if this had been vodafone three or ee they would have got the device blacklisted by now it is little trouble for them to do for me it is not something that should be a cost to them i do not think i have appealed to the regulator but the chances are that tesco mobile helping me is voluntary it is likely no help will be given and it will not be enforceable i thought i would share my experience with others and with tesco mobile to let them know what problems i have had maybe they will assist me from here it is a last hope thing so time will tell,Bad
4047,customer service is beyond terrible the internet service is intermittent at best and slow i would not recommend this company to anyone,Bad
4048,stay away from this company tried to cancel a contract within hrs because of the lies they told at the start the rep said he is no longer able to cancel it you then get bounced around the customer service they hang up on you or leave you for long periods without speaking a scam outfit is branson still in charge he ought to be ashamed of himself if he is,Bad
4049,you for taking the time to leave a review im sorry that youve had a poor experience with our services this is very disappointing to hear and i can assure you that this isnt the level of service that we want to have these tips available to help with broadband broadband help status page hints and tips troubleshooting do have the connect app that will allow you to scan your property to optimise the wireless network and if needed order pods depending on your package these may be free but any package is eligible for these if can also give the team a call on from a virgin media landline or option then option this will get you through to the broadband technical team who will be able to look into this further for you we also have a vast variety of ways to contact us for help or support and i have listed a few below for facebook,Bad

4054,if i could i wouldnt even give them one star i have used ee for a very long time recently my partner got me a month contract ended in june i called days prior to cancel the contract they continued to charge me till august and and i was told they can not cancel even if i as the customer to has asked them they would investigate the matter and i would contained to be charged while the investigation has been carried out at they end they offered me for the inconvenience i have call logs with them which shows they had me on hold for hour mins and recorded conversations how rudely they spoke to me as a customer who laid there bill on time every month even during the pandemic please avoid ee at all cost no matter how good the deal sounds you will be over charged and treated badly,Bad
4055,well ive been posting my issues with talk talk now since lst it was all sorted i was assured for the rd time from talk talk customer service that i owe any money this was there mistake and i will be credited for all the calls i have had to make to sort this morning i get another demanding letter from talk talk and a another letter from the credit agency they use for bed enough is enough im just going round in circles so fair warning talk talk in now going to take you to a small claims for stress and anxiety i guess im going to have to call credit wise my self as talk talk are not doing there job and closing my account,Bad
4056,over priced always repeats going to switch provider over for viewings ive already viewed disgusting,Bad
4057,the internet is generally ok but the customer service is useless every time you talk to someone they say different things there is no managers available to make decisions i think its worth spending the extra few quid to be with one of the providers who has actual customer service team,Bad
4058,everything has gone wrong i wonder if one day ill hear back from my complaint i cant wait till my contract ends id rather pay double anywhere else you may as well have cats be helping you cats are less useless i genuinely believe a cat could do a better job also it doesnt give me the option for stars id go into negative numbers if i could cats are horrible but id rather they provided my internet,Bad
4059,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad
4060,bt was the only provider available in our area thus the only reason we opted to go for them initially our router for our broadband developed a fault and for one month we were paying for something that we could not use when we finally got someone to acknowledge that we wanted to make a complaint about the issue and the awful customer service we were promised an amount off our next bill the date of our next bill rolls by and its no lower than usual we had a voicemail telling us the complaint will be closed with no contact number or even a name to get in touch with if we did not want this when we eventually got through the advisor told me there were no notes on the account about the refund at all saying that we shouldnt get anything back anyway disgraceful customer service the option should be there for stars if there are other options in your area id suggest staying as far away from this company as possible unless you like being made empty promises and wasting your time speaking with impolite ill advised staff and getting nowhere,Bad

4063,slow and terrible speeds constantly dropping to or less than what they said they would offer con you into buying more expensive packages and deals an engineer comes to fix the issue and all is fine for a few weeks before the same issues arise again ive got through probably half a dozen or more routers in a few years with the next being hardly better than one before random crashes are frequent i only get around mbps whereas my friends with different providers are getting xx that in the same area youre locked into a year contract and must buy your way out so dont fall for it,Bad

4076,my income date changes from month to month and im always a couple of days late i have been charged atleast times in the past year can someone show me some evidence of how these charges and what they are covering because to my understanding it just sounds like being penalised and punished for jot having a direct debit set up i pay my bill every single month youll see on my account and yet im penalised and have been charged multiple times im considering leaving your company just because of these charges id rather you cut me off to remind me pay my bill rather than be charged when i was already going o pay it im fed up of this my money is tight as it is thanks for taking my small amount of savings over this past year much appreciated if i could rate zero i would otherwise you guys are acc the best internet provider ive had its you scam so many customers with these late penalty fees banks charge p if that for a late charge banks arent even aloud to anymore if you scrapped this and switched me off instead then that would be a better way of reminding your customer to pay the bill not make them pay extra customer is back to front im shocked i would like to think i can remove this review with my complaint being resolved and ill like to think i can put a more accurate review of bt as a company,Bad
4077,as always talktalk gets it wrong every time i log into the my account there is always something wrong then when you try to call their customer services what a joke its all automated messages stating how they are very sorry but they cannot do the job everyone is paying them to do and of course the obligatory dead line after several numbers searched through the internet and old emails from talktalk they are either dead lines or the same automated message email them get the same response but in more flamboyant language with a hour waiting period before they are willing to respond if at all i thought talktalk were finally starting to grow up and become a proper company after all these years but alas i was living in a deluded world of my own time for me to move on to another company,Bad
4078,i have rang the times to sort my bill out has i dont get paid til the th of april has i lost my father not long ago i tried to explain to them i cant afford to pay anything now it would be the th april the can only give me to the march to pay it but how can i when i dont have the money to do so also how am i ment to get my bill sent to me when i cant use my data when im on the phone to them has i have set up a direct debit with them and i have been because of my bill not getting paid on time even the supervisor couldnt help me when they can under rule the decision,Bad
4079,iv been with talk talk over years and had nothing but issues anyway today i have tried to cancel my broadband with them times iv had the line cut i can speak to any other department the ones that say they cant cancel your account but as soon as i tell the retention team iv gone with another company they cut the line iv messaged every which way i can to get them to cancel and the only reply i get is has to be with the team you know the ones you cant speak to so how the hell am i suppose to cancel,Bad
4080,if i could give virgin stars i would or even a negative wasted the most ridiculous amount of time and energy trying to sort out a problem with my account last year spent over hours on the phone and dealt with about different people who kept messing it up utterly ridiculous and now they have the cheek to keep emailing me and asking me to rate them,Bad
4081,have been a customer with virgin on and off for years now and yes you get a few hiccups with a company this size but normally when its running smoothly it stays like i have been feel like i have been abused by this an email offering to double my bb from mb to mb free what a nice customer loyalty thing to do i thought no such thing as a free lunch my contract ended soon after and i found i was paying almost double a month as i now had thats a bit the contract and was later offered a better deal i didnt take it as i wanted to see what tv package my wife and child wanted i was told i could phone back and speak to the customer services chap jamie and take the deal called back the day before disconnection to find that they have disconnected me services were rude yes plain rude it was like speaking to a broken record talking over me and not letting me finish my not help would not transfer me to a complaints department eventually managed to get a po box to write to the point of theft liar bully rude virgin does have some good bb speeds but so disappointed in the way i have been treated if this review helps one person stay clear and save them the stress i have been through it has been worth you read this please try not to lie to your customers almost a joke there about a virgin lying,Bad
4082,seriously avoid read their reviews and completely avoid please for your own sanity,Bad
4083,thanks for taking the time to explain what has happened id really love to see if we can look into this further for you and find out whats happened if you can send us a message on ees facebook or twitter we can arrange for a call from one of our team thanks sam,Bad
4084,i am very distressed and shaken from the most unbelievably appealing customer service i have ever witnessed in my life so far a call agent started off rather cocky and snappy later speaking to me in a sarcastic tone with which i complied this later turned into a slight hostile tone and unhappy with the service by now i asked for the operators name the agent refused to give his name and started in turn to argue with me to which i admit i did become emotional i am very pleased with the package i have received and know very well that most employees at ee are not like this i am aware of this as i spoke to an agent called matt who was extremely helpful and compliant despite all of this i feel i have no choice than to give ee a review simply because of this one caller so that such a giant like ee will take swift action against this culprit in order to avoid this happening to another customer,Bad
4085,worst customer service experienced my phone was stolen asked for replacement sim days later still no sign of it asked for a pac code to get a sim from different place cant do that because i have to text from my sim which they taking their sweet time sending so i am no access to my banking emails apple id messaging rang up chatted several times once got shouted at by a very rude customer service assistant seriously never had such bad experience in my life,Bad
4086,when i moved from sky to virgin i was promised that they would pay my cancellation fee of despite numerous calls this still hasnt happened although you have acknowledged you did promise me this you also sold me an o volt sim which you said was free but ended up costing me absolutely disgraceful virgin,Bad
4087,after hours and hours of various contacts with customer service speaking to operatives who where poorly trained and with no experience listed all my problems and sent it by email to the concerns email address hoping someone would address my problems it was listed as a complaint and i received a phone call from a manager who worked in the loyalty department who said he was not technical so was not in a position to answer any of my queries this phone call closed the complaint dont know what has gone wrong with the service at talktalk over the last few years but ill be surprised if its still in business in a few years time,Bad
4088,isnt it ironic o wont change me over to any other type of service unless they do full company financial checks it a business account but unbelievably they have it through a company that closed in twenty years ago just shows how good they are and it seem to me the only way to get anything done is to move supplier then they contact with a great,Bad
4089,i am lost for words on how bad virgin media service is after several years of loyalty to them and doing absolutely nothing wrong from my side it has been an absolute nightmare trying to have been so many so many inconsistencies lies to keep their agent ratings complaints without proper response and being passed around that i dont even know how to explain it in words i am never returning to virgin media again its the most bad customer experience ive ever had,Bad
4090,so much for being a loyal ee customer connections all lost in one go glad to have left ee now but even so they still come haunting i wanted to pay the last bill but never having received a letter or copy of it and with no access to online account i didnt magically guess what to pay a month later equifax notified me of my ee account being in arrears i immediately called my bank to see why couldnt ee take last bill payment from direct debit bank said the account must have been closed or for any other reason the direct debit shows to have been dropped by the merchant fair enough i got in touch with ee they said i had to pay bill failure fee for missed direct debit sorry what the direct debit that you cancelled and the bill that you never sent me a copy of and the charge that you passed on to my credit report as arrears all of that you ee wants to blame it on its customer understandable that they would want to do this as my family and i are now their ex customers but that shows how much they are an unethical business that is only money oriented and no customer service whatsoever little do they care we have an ee broadband at one of our other businesses and we will be cancelling that now better off with virgin where people are respected i am not bothered about the extra but the of them as a corporation wanting to make money like that is violating all kinds of corporate responsibility id have happily paid the final bill had they been so honest and accountable to accept their error and waive that off as it should have been but instead bob on twitter managed to repeatedly tell me the same thing like a robot we couldnt take the payment so charge will remain on the bill thats not at all helpful and is surely not indicative of him being happy working for ee as he is clearly putting in efforts for wanting to help tried ee for long enough convinced that not only their network is awfully patchy terrible for your phone batteries as the sim constantly tries for g coverage and drains your phone badly voice calls are only over wifi or nothing but their customer service during and after is just as pathetic get some investment into training your staff theres other networks out there catching up to you and you know it,Bad
4091,never though that i would write a negative feedback about such a company such as bt the reason is the following i was offered a very good deal on fast broadband by virgin and tried to ask whether bt can do a price match or if not to terminate the contract the first adviser in the online chat just hung up on me the second after min transferred me to the dedicated team where i had to explain everything from beginning for the rd time and of course they were unable do to a price match with virgin,Bad
4092,didnt resolve my problem asked ridiculous questions clearly didnt understand would not recommend to my worst enemy,Bad
4093,date of experience may,Bad
4094,oh dear seems ive made a monumental mistake i got fed up with the poor signal from mobile at my home area coupled with them no longer supporting roaming i switched to o not believing that their signal at my home could be worse than s but i could not have been more wrong i now get g or zero signal with very infrequent and brief increases to g utterly useless for internet access and certainly not what im paying for oh yes and o have just informed me the theyre about to increase the price by over whats worse o require new customers to sign up for years with no cancellation option without a penalty payment of the entire remainder of the contract in service is rubbish to the extent that i hung up on one of their people who was patronising rude and bullying during the phone call ordering me to keep a diary of whenever the service was inadequate to which i responded its inadequate all the time so theres no point in doing so in summary avoid o like the plague,Bad
4095,ref now days and the problem with my sim card has still not been resolved no caller id when anyone rings me is anyone at even looking into this problem because if they are they obviously dont know what they are doing,Bad
4096,i have never ever paid a bill that is the price i agreed to pay always significantly higher i dont go over my data usage i dont use my phone that frequently extortionate and zero reception in flats homes and shops so happy my contract is up so i can stop giving them money,Bad
4097,scammed me took money without my permission charges me for another month when my service even work refused to give it back changed to another provider at the beginning of the the period asked for money back because the service didnt work they refused to refund any money even though i couldnt use the services and ignored all my emails,Bad
4098,cost us in revenue caused our managing director to have months off work due to stress we should be taking you to court disgusting to think you genuinely speak to the complaints team about what has happened and the horrific circumstances and the answer is its in our terms and conditions are you human the sales guy promised us the world they told us it wouldnt be a problem never ever trust bt,Bad
4099,tried to renegotiate my virgin package as i am retiring but being put on hold for over an hour and not delivering on price agreed is not the way to do business with your long serving customers and after a promised follow up investigation nothing no response obviously a virgin delay tactic to cling on to dissatisfied customers but it wont work,Bad
4100,terrible yt quality lots of lag,Bad
4101,useless useless these lot weird terms and conditions that they dont care about your info or anything they track u like a hawk for there own yo guys the terms and conditions basically says we will use your info sell it and then close your phone number if your out of a country for months we dont care if your number has like contacts but when we track you and you come back to then u can use it nice one,Bad
4102,still waiting to hear about a complaint i raised about weeks ago never able to speak to anyone in the uk whoever you speak to outside the uk are difficult to understand when they pass you to the next dept they never advise of the issue you have so you have to explain it all again and then you are told that you are through to the wrong dept the offshore staff just want to pass it on to someone else but never to anyone in the uk offices appalling customer service never known a company like it in my life absolutely shoddy in every sense i dont think it can get any worse than this anywhere,Bad
4103,the worst service ive ever had trying to change broadband or phone online staff on the chat refusing to pass me on to a manager refusing to add things that they did not tell me about specifically fixed price plus phone up and end up being after the phone lines close crap,Bad
4104,absolutely atrocious customer service as a response to the below reply from the vodafone social media but l would rather spend the afternoon slamming my testicles in a cutlery drawer,Bad
4105,totally useless phone internet and wifi constant slowdowns and frequent complete loss of service which conveniently fail to register with talk talk have lost landline now twice since constant router reboots are required making unsustainable i now wish i had never left the also appalling bt,Bad
4106,poor customer service very slow internet,Bad
4107,after my previous review on talktalk customer service i felt i must add so other people can be aware of this companies lack of caring even during this pandemic i moved out of a property in jan my talktalk contract was not up until july i asked talktalk to move the services to my new property as they would not let me leave the contract early i was ready to cancel and never use them again in january however they said i would have to pay some ridiculous fee to leave so moving services to the new property was the only option expect it wasnt due to the talktalk stopped installed on properties and i did not have any services installed in my new house so i have paid months for a service that i wasnt in the property for wasnt setup at my new have complained a number of times but frankly i am sick and tired of dealing with the absolutely terrible indian support teams and the management is even more insignificant i will never use them again nor recommend them if i hear people in the street talking about talktalk i advise them strongly against using them and tell them of my work in support for rackspace technology and we strive to offer fanatically support to our customers talktalk needs to take some lesson from other companies it is not something i expect from a uk in,Bad
4108,awful service,Bad
4109,been charged for moving my box that was never to get an answer from customer service is a is after waiting between minutes an hour,Bad
4110,i joined talk talk just over a month ago with the telephone and broadband not working at my go live date due to someone else being allocated my two days with tt online help getting told them my allocated number was being used by another person i phoned them up and they agreed they should be on anther line not this one but eventually the penny dropped and with a bit of tweaking at the bt exchange box by bt it was sorted or so i on one into my account to check my monthly bill to find calls on my bill that i never hours with tt online help getting passed from pillar to post and it is still not resolved but when i dialed their to check my line it comes up with fault on line so it would seem that once again someone else is in control of my line hence the bill for calls i never is a fraud and security issue that tt does not seem to care have spent probably days on and off with their helpline and i am an it guy i pity others that are not tech savvy if i could cancel my contract that i am tied into for months i would do right nowyou have been hunter,Bad
4111,worst customer service have to wait for mins when called and it is same waiting time when called any time of the day topped up to wrong number and have to wait week and numerous calls to find out that will not get the refund could have told me when i called them first every time called they keep saying will take hrs to get my money back and asked me to email them with the request now after a week they replied back saying they cannot refund waster time energy and money for their incompetence will not recommend them to any one please avoid them,Bad
4112,i definitely would not recommend going with talk talk customer services is rubbish i have been left waiting on the phone for nearly an hour and still waiting these companies get away with so much imagine if we didnt pay our bills on time then it would be a different story this is my precious time they just dont care avoid at all costs,Bad
4113,honestly i can only describe the call centre a total waste of time and when you need help they put you on hold then hang up on you they will happily lie to you over and over again about fees and package prices truly disgraceful,Bad
4114,worst company please please avoid it when you try to cancel the service because you are moving country they will make you run in circles and use all the dark techniques broken website links no way to request moving out of country online and no way to find the process for that i was forced to call them times and every time they would say i would get the confirmation in the email but then there is no confirmation i am not sure if there is any regulator who is looking in to these unfair and practices they make your stressful move am never using virgin for any future business forever,Bad
4115,i have been with for over years and all has been fine till the last few months now talktalk seem to be more interested in getting new customers and not keeping customers they have already happy well if you keep it up like this then you will loose more customers than you did contact your customer services and nothing has changed so my review stays the same you would prefer to loose a current loyal customer of many years because you are only interested in getting new customers just no loyalty from talktalk once you sign up with them,Bad
4116,i have has the worst experience with virgin media they took money from my account without my approval and did not give me a refund the wifi connection is dreadful i could only use the internet in the room where the broadband box was customer service was really bad really rude people that do not want to help at all overall i believe this company is a money trap and really bad quality both customer service and the internet,Bad
4117,have recently had to move out due to financial difficulty every other utility company were sympathetic of the situation octopus energy affinity water more than home insurance apart from talktalk they hit me with high cancellation charges and another days fees despite me leaving the property and disconnecting the service immediately beware good deals yes but they get you in the they post they will help you here but the reality is they do not so do not be fooled just because they reply a shady tactic,Bad
4118,if you take out new deal to save money and already a customer with talk talk divide the cost of the router by months and add to you bill then you can see your not saving as much as you thought and in my case the new router is no better or faster than the old one i cant be faster as the phone line is the same as before no matter what they going with talk talk again in fact its all one big scam they all charge the same for the service regardless of what they promise,Bad
4119,the masters of small print scams youll never get to understand the terms and conditions and theyll take as much money as they can from you if only there was an alternative,Bad
4120,my sister was taken into hospital months ago after her vertebra cracked and went into her spine shes now from waste down shes been a customer of bt for yrs shes now completely bedridden and back home bt cut her phone of today which is also her emergency line she had no internet this is the most disgraceful phone provider ive ever come across her payments are up to date and they keep her of with excuses and lies shocking treatment you should be ashamed,Bad
4121,i regret my to go with talk talk its very clear that they do not have correct procedure to follow up they missed engineer when i called customer care after waited for hours for engineer i was informed that bt needed to complete external work they could have informed before hand if they know that external work is still due could have saved my work day lost a days the engineer turned up after a week for second appointment and said he has nothing to do with router which i should have received by the engineer then again called customer care and was informed that the order was not placed for router due to system error and a new order is placed which takes an other week to then i had to use my mobile which is even more my of going to talk talk as they have better pricing i end up losing more than what i would lost worth around,Bad
4122,never works and useless at fixing problems even keeping emails working is a struggle for them avoid this company at all costs,Bad
4123,for sharing your experience though im sorry weve not met your expectations so far if you still need help please send us a text with an explanation of the issue to for cable services or if the problem is with your mobile services well get back to you as soon as we can with further virgin media,Bad
4124,i regret having to give this star i would prefer no stars same engineer who caused us so much grief last time turned up again with the same unhelpful approach to doing his work have had to rebook a new fibre bb installation appointment through our provider who seem to be unable to request that open reach do not send him again or even to relate the problem that needs resolving meanwhile i need to wait another weeks only for it all to happen again like ground hog day when hopefully someone else turns up with the right equipment knowledge to solve the problem which is preventing the work to be done someone needs to do something about loosening the strangle hold bt have preventing anyone else touching their installation equipment so that better trained engineers can complete the work first time round,Bad
4125,firstly all efforts were made to make a payment finally got through and was told the amount of was due my partner tried to set up a standing order they said he would need to call back the phone like is shocking can never get through cant make payment in store can not get though via on line chat so how the hell are you to make a payment days after my partner called them to set up the direct payment they put an additional odd on top of the bill i literally had to go into the shop and create to get the manager to type in a code to get us through the service line when we got though they told us about the addition charges as u can imagine i wasnt best pleased but for the sake of getting rid i said id just pay the final amount the woman on the phone said we will call you back to make the payment i literally was beside myself and said i will not let u off the phone y til u take this payment i had to perform to make a payment whats that about why are they putting more barriers up to make a payment we are now paid in full but the big issues we have and my partner have our house on the market went to accept an offer as we were told back last mortgage not an issue went to mortgage advisor guess what they have put a default on his name so means we have been effected the amount of stress and upset this has caused is un real we are trying too be for school for my son and to be nearer my disabled parents now we are going through resolver nearly two weeks after they havent got back to us iv also personally put a complaint in due to th effects its having on me and my son as he is upset as im upset why do these people think its acceptable to effect your life when they make it so difficult to sort anything out and put a default on you when your trying to make a payment if anyone has any advice i would appreciate it iv spoken to citizens advice and i think ill go with legal soon and also next step will be to look at the impact this has had on my family my health etc,Bad
4126,by are the broadband providers available you pay for a connection that works percent of the time and when it does half of that time is spent on unusable connections the wifi only reliably works next to the router dont invest,Bad
4127,virgin services do not work the wifi is awful if you call they really are it interested and offer a booster which also does make no difference mr branson is in the moon and really does not care,Bad
4128,wish i had never switched as soon as my contracts are up im cutting the cord customer service is an absolute joke internet down for a known fault with their v hubs can fail after a power cut engineer was friendly customer service couldnt have cared less made promises for engineers that after they didnt arrive was subsequently told were never booked clearly lied to just to get an unhappy customer off the since switch to o i have no data or phone signal the a new sim lol like that is going to what new sim didnt even work wouldnt even connect the thought of spending another hour trying to get through to somebody who a cares and b is competent is too much payg for me now until contract is up and then im outta and the menu navigation sucks,Bad
4129,my tv service outages and recording issues have been going on for almost all of the months ive been connected to via let me say that the two bt uk based employees which i eventually was put in touch with online have been incredibly helpful i give them for their assistance in these ongoing problems and their final resolution fingers i cannot ever condone or understand however is how bt one of the biggest companies in the uk can operate in a way which means that if you want anything done at all you have to spend hours in fact days online chatting with bt employees thats once youve spent hours on the phone to the completely unintelligible and unhelpful call centre in india tell me just how can bt market and operate a tv service with no tv engineers it beggars belief my incredibly irritating and stressful problems have eventually been resolved for the time being purely by the process of elimination by what appears to be a voluntary team of enthusiastic backroom bt workers bt seems to have a target for customer dissatisfaction not the other way around i left sky after years to join bt and have regretted it from the first day i was connected i cannot wait to leave next may and return to normality albeit at a higher price but at the end of the day ill be safe in the knowledge that if i ever have a problem with sky ill be able to call them up speak to someone english within minutes and have an engineer booked shortly after that who i will know can either fix the problem for me or replace the equipment simple as that finally i have to say that if i had seen this review page i would never ever have joined bt out of is way too high a mark in my opinion,Bad
4130,content restrictions is making my browsing the internet impossible i tried to remove the restrictions on the appropriate page you made available to me but was unsuccessful several times i entered my passport numbers as instructed but i did not get anywhere i am years old why do you restrict the content i want to browse or watch its making my experience with your company unsatisfactory and there is no one to speak to to help me with this problem,Bad
4131,had an identity fraud situation re some mobile phones sent to us and a courier trying to collect them we refused contacted suppliers dial a phone and phones you no problem with them they sent prepaid bags to return them but trying to contact ee was a nightmare one rude employee put the phone down when trying to explain just said contract was suspended kept getting bills eventually when i insisted speaking to an english person not ethnic who i could not understand they said all will be sorted ok and no black mark against wife who has had a tmobile pay as you go phone for years spotted a deal which she thought would suit her she has never had a credit card or a credit account in her life was refused on appeal a very brusque reply was received saying decision was overturned for only a has been accepted by another supplier without any problem so requested pak code weeks ago still waiting dont go near ee,Bad
4132,switched to this isp a while back and was working exceptionally well recently and by that i mean months and still going the internet would connect to certain devices but not all had an engineer come over problem still persists do not rely on this provider as the internet would cut off randomly while still showing its connected to wifi,Bad
4133,for the last year weve been receiving letters from bt for someone who has never loved at this address weve sent them all back marked not known at this address and were not even bt a debt collection letter arrived clearly showing the customers phone and account details in the window three hours of being passed from call centre to call centre ive now been told i need to contact the customer myself to ask him to change his and utter shambles from a company who clearly dont know the first thing about customer care,Bad

4139,dont touch with a barge pole after a previous good experience with talktalk i changed from bt to them and suffered less than mb broadband speeds on a line sky gave me mb they wouldnt cancel my contract within days and they told me they would charge me for an engineer to come and look at my phone line i went with virgin media instead and i have never looked back,Bad
4140,i have had bt for quite a long time and so far the service has been very bad the router kept on flashing orange occasionally and the speeds kept on dropping the customer service was especially bad and pretty useless at solving my issue they did send a new router but the same issue kept on happening i am thinking of leaving bt at this point,Bad
4141,i fully understand why this companys support is so bad people leave just because of that reason alone i have never experienced such poor support from any other company as bad as this few years ago i wrote to then the ceo dido harding and only then was my problem investigated and i also pointed out to her executives who took lead on my problem were the problem lay now in instead of it improving it actually has got worse to a point that now am going to leave this company if companies source out thier support abroad thinking they saving many expect to have s leaving in drones your outsourcing will be the reason i be leaving its just crap,Bad

4171,i switched to because they offered a cheap deal which was exactly what i was looking the point of signing up porting my number in was a real pain due to them not having on their list of supported providers so i couldnt use the form getting in touch with customer support was a nightmare constant disconnections with the online chat and finding a way to speak to a human on the phone no chance the port finally got put through and i figured i could get past the teething issues cut to a month later and my renewal payment didnt go through i assumed my card details were possibly wrong so added the same card again and it claimed that card was already on file tried to manually top up but my new customer offer of off didnt seem to apply in fact no plan appears to have been applied to my account tried to get in touch with customer support and then it just got really frustrating the online chat wouldnt connect tried multiple browsers couldnt find a way to speak to someone on the phone found the customer support email but to this day never received a reply edit i got a reply after days that wasnt particularly helpful eventually found that if you try and report a network error you can get through to someone after waiting for minutes frustratingly the individual on the other end couldnt hear me i could hear them and ultimately ended the more to it than the above but its good to vent right but ultimately the customer service systems that are in place are horrifically bad you hope you wont need them but sadly i did ive requested my pac and cant wait to leave them,Bad

4173,it always says on the tv adverts that there will be no price rises in your contract so now they do it in a more stealthy way by making you pay for something you dont want need or cant have access to i have only one tv and one box so why should i have to pay for something i cannot use will talktalk be telling the homeless they need house insurance next,Bad

4286,abysmal website is a joke their online broadband help just keeps asking the same questions until you quit in frustration i upgraded to the new halo service and instantly lost a rd of my internet speed and when i finally got an engineer out he did everything he could to suggest it was my problem despite the fact that i have years of experience in it and that the only thing that had changed prior to halo was on their cant wait for virgin to activate their service had a second engineers visit today he instantly knew something was wrong when i pointed it out to him said its probably a problem with the exchange and hed get on to them less than minutes later i receive a text from bt telling me the problems been resolved it hasnt months of halo and its never met its minimum speed quote not once this despite the fact that my older broadband achieved it and i do not use twitter facebook or any other social media nonsense get an actual complaints department,Bad

4313,the live chat agent was rude unhelpful and tried to fob me off by telling me that the problem was with all of the electronic devices in my house and not the internet he then disconnected the chat instead of helping me,Bad
4314,what a pile of crap wish i could give them a minus amount of stars lied to about being able to have fibre broadband just to get a sale spoke to english person for the sale but when ringing customer services seemed call centre is probably not in england couldnt always understand what was being said and seemed to just go round in circles repeating myself after telling them im cancelling my account with them my broadband was crap couldnt get online and only had devices running have an open complaint ongoing and cant wait to leave them bt may be more expensive but at least their call centres are in england and they provide fibre to my property have wasted about hours of my life on them,Bad

4316,used to be great but i have no service for the last few months when i complain that i cannot email anything i am told to send an email with have no service and no response from zen,Bad
4317,the most infuriating service i think i have ever experienced i have a phone contract with vodafone somehow they have managed to mess up my account so badly to the point where i still have a contract which i am paying for but no username or password this is absolutely ridiculous i have tried over a month period to fix this problem with multiple contacts to the company from myself that in itself is incredibly difficult because as i say i have no username or password so it can make even accessing support more difficult when eventually i do get through they will tell me they have reset my account and send over my new username and password shock horror they never work they will then ask me to try again and again still never works at one point it took me to an oracle webpage that looked like there server or something they then say ok we need to pass this on to our technical support who will contact by email amazingly they never do they also wont give you a number or reference for your complaint so when they inevitably dont respond you have to start the whole complaints process again to me it feels that the complaints process is purposefully make incredibly complicated and difficult for the customer and this doesnt surprise me as saw that vodafone had been fined for there complaints procedures i am looking forward to the day i can swift providers because they are taking money from me for an account i have limited access to at best,Bad
4318,hopeless no help whatsoever couldnt even get the address,Bad
4319,i wish i could put no stars the service i got from ee is disgraceful i left in july and was told my account was upto date and no payments were needed however i found out today just due to checking my credit score that i owed them money i didnt receive anything from them at all contacted them today and they were no help at all,Bad

4321,i suspect ee probably stands for enough good news is our escape today from this unpleasant uncaring outfit their excellent customer service claim is a hollow boast in my experience ee couldnt care less and thats generous the startling high rate of crummy reviews on trustpilot should serve as a grave warning ee is not awful and is worse to preserve your avoid avoid stuart kuttner,Bad
4322,unlimited data but never works in busy areas or motorways poor customer service,Bad
4323,i got pestered and pestered day in day out by brokers selling contracts in the end i gave in and spoke with them to be honest i thought a fair deal was on the table so i took a business sim out what happened next i was told with my deal it was per month so what did do try and take out of my account as it happens my bank which is brilliant bought this to my attention the day before the direct debit was taken out gave me chance to cancel my direct debit before it came out shocking do not deal with or one com they dont explain the whole truth behind the deals and you will get exploited you have been warned update i contacted on line hour went through advisors and then to be told i have to go to the broker one com oh dear no app no contact please do not go to one call or im sorry at my age i dont wont this worry stay away,Bad

4326,very bad customer care i have ever seen not happy at all,Bad
4327,i suspect like any of the big multimedia companies virgin dont really care about scores on the likes of trustpilot people will run them down for minor and petty problems genuine problems are lost in the fog of moans they have a lot of customers and make a lot of money so having terrible customer service and a poor reputation on these sort of sites is probably unimportant to lutz schuler calls both in excess of mins trying to sort out my broadband deal in response to their email passed from team to team each promising to offer you a better deal but only able to read from a script if you cause them to deviate with a question oh a problem customer dont listen they have no clue how to accept advance notice of not wishing to renew either trying to cancel the existing contract now or trying to sign you onto a new one today apparently i should either ring back daily to see if i can get a better deal or wait till the new contract renews then ring back and try and cancel note cancelation of virgin contracts comes with a penalty if you try and calmly explain youll be in an endless loop of them trying to cancel the existing contract now and you having to explain yet again that you are just giving notice that you dont want to complaints option via whatsapp is a joke today a series of well be with you shortly followed by you appear to have been waiting a long time do you wish to continue y n messages until then a weve all gone home today response phone us beware my experience over the last years is the same as with the likes of bt and sky basically okay till you have a problem or want to change something then good luck make sure you have options and a time their staff probably dont really give a dam about their jobs,Bad
4328,if i could give no stars i would theirs is by far the worst customer service you can possibly get they dont care about the customers because they are thousands of miles away being paid pittance if you complain they ignore it or call you a lair basically i supposedly have meg broadband every time i tun a speed check it is between and depending on the time of day this is disgraceful i even threatened to sue them once and i got a page letter from their tv service keeps but they just blamed my tv it is not it has been received a visit from an engineer who said the problem is their service isnt big enough to cope with the volume of customers so basically until they do something about that like investing money instead of lining their own pockets then there is no foreseeable answer they are without a doubt the worst internet and tv suppliers in the uk but because they are such a big company no one can take them i have tried all that and more you are just adding proving my point even more i have given notice to leave vm after being a customer for years no one has even bothered to try and keep me as a customer it just shows you have no respect or regard for your customers you are a disgrace,Bad
4329,my broadband and internet continually drops in and out the box doesnt work fully all the time and i cant watch half of the programmes i pay for and i havent been able to co tact anyone to get this sorted which is a joke,Bad
4330,beware beware months they will increase your bill and theres nothing you can do about it if you are desperate enough to go with this filthy company and dont want to listen to anyones advice record your telephone calls also beware of the cessation charge they wont tell you about it until you want to leave then slap when you want to switch provider advise if your already in a contract with bt and are trying to leave them tell them you live in hull because they cannot provide services to hull therefore cannot charge the cessation charge i will never ever go with this company or any other company affiliated with bt libby bar and the rest of the cronies should of been sacked a long time ago,Bad
4331,terrible company they advertised service in my building i contracted broadband and when the guys came they said they could not install broadband in the building they then cancelled the contract kept my original payment by card and are now billing me for the cost of the open reach engineer and a cancellation charge do not recommend them at all,Bad
4332,my broadband service is not at all good it drops in and out at all times of the day and night it was suggested it was due to peak usage at am i very much doubt it a case was opened with customer services who decided to tell me in an email today they are closing it because they have not been able to contact me they havent tried very hard no missed calls no voicemails no texts no emails and no letters utterly useless would advise against changing to this reply below it is clear from my review i have contacted you already and received no response,Bad
4333,they shouldnt be allowed to be in business never use ee days ago i raised a request for my iphone to be unlocked i called again a few days later and was told nothing can be done until the initial days has passed yesterday i tried calling on over occasions and couldnt get through once every time the call was dropped or ignored i raised a complaint which has yet to have a response and posted you facebook which finally got a human answer but told me they cant help today i tried calling on more occasions with neither call getting through same as contacted apple directly and they have informed me that as soon as they receive the request the unlock is instant but they are yet to receive any such request from them ee refuse to unlock your phone they want you to pay their horrible roaming charges and make it near impossible to leave them,Bad
4334,complain or try to leave virgin media then you must join the mad hatters tea party the helpline staff are there to harass and frustrate you as they remain calm and play by their rules and they are out for a laugh customers are just cannon fodder and part of the wont burden you with my sorry tale except to say that i have been trying to escape since th of february cannot bear the thought of having any discussion with them they are still keeping me captive my last email was how did we do,Bad
4335,router failing again and talk talk support insisting on home issues i work in industry and know thats not the case and needing to run line checks which cant do whilst router is down has wasted my time numerous times before just accept what im asking and send a new router,Bad
4336,where do i begin i thought i was making a good choice moving to virgin media as their broadband was brilliant last time i had it what a wrong decision that was customer service is appalling noone seems to know what theyre doing and when you get someone that does only god can help you find them again they dont call when they say they will and dont even respond to complaints online the web chat is a waste of time basically the whole thing is a shambles from the start was given wrong advice and mis sold package and overcharged then when tried to resolve issue couldnt over a month on and still no resolution or response also the internet is very poor even with a booster i wonder if ill get a response and a resolution to this review i have to say customer service is the worst yet shame because the broadband used to be brilliant this time around im extremely disappointed all around,Bad
4337,spent hours this morning only to pay the bill and cancelling the account and still waiting while i am writing this absolute joke spoke to people and they transferring it all the time to others my bad day had to deal with this never ever will go for virgin again,Bad
4338,had been with vodafone for about years for the last months was over charged eventually after an hour i would get this resolved only to be told it wont happen seeing a deal on affordable mobiles i rang customer services they where willing to match this by applying a monthly discount saving me the hassle of claiming back the discount needles to say when the phone arrived and was able to check the bill there is no discount and customer services deny there should be a only glad i found out now while still inside the day so it can be returned and now leaves me to find a provider that is honest if there is waiting to see what other charges the try to get from me,Bad
4339,we used them for years even though they went rapidly downhill after liberty global took moved house recently tried to move our virgin service with us it was so painful trying to communicate with them i started to look forward to speaking to my and having my teeth drilled at the dentist the web chat must have been designed by someone on work experience in their lunch break painful slow constantly getting cut off they kept getting our termination date wrong in the end i gave up trying to correct it they seemed to make it up as they we managed to get an answer they said connecting our new home would take months no one had any idea why computer said no virgin then decided to charge us for early termination of contract and for a crap old set top box despite the fact we returned it to get our money back we had to supply proof of our new address so they could confirm we werent making it up just to get away from them this was with the home movers team who were very good unfortunately only at ignoring emails after sending them half our we eventually managed to find a personal document they would accept after much more frustrating communication and being bounced around their ivr in a near endless loop obviously designed to get rid of annoying customers i managed to get hold of an indian chap who said they would return the money by cheque ive not seen one of those since the s anyway months later and we are still chasing for our money it seems legal action is the only option awful company do not use virgin media would be my advice,Bad
4340,couldnt use app wrong sim sent so didnt use and signed up with another provider,Bad
4341,i had pay as you go with o for years or so never had any network or billing issues pay as you go is pretty straight forward i wanted to build up my credit history as i just graduated and have none so i was recommended to get a phone contract to start with so i shopped around and found what i thought it was a great deal iphone c gb with a contract for unlimited text and phone calls with gb of data free phone the first bill was supposed to be as you may think but it came as so i call them and after a lot of phone queuing and finally speak to a real person they admitted was an error on my bill fine but it didnt ended here i up a bank direct debit for them for they never used it and instead email me and text me asking to pay my bill i call and the only help i get offered was to pay via the phone manually with my debit card they then charge nearly for handling fees although i have a direct debit that they decided to ignore their fault my money they have done this for months so far i have write to them a formal complain in a proper hard copy letter they have not acknowledge the letter or got back to me yet o days has past they have months to reply legally after that i will be taking them to the ombudsman i had to chase them and is a waste of my time that i will never get back they are suppose to be giving a service well my g never works actually i have checked many times and my old iphone s and o network works better that my new and g supplied by ee their network map is pure invention i checked it on my area before commiting to them do not trust them this experience has put me off ee so much that i am counting the days to finish the months contract with them what a waste of money if they were half decent i would stay but they are not to be trusted be careful if you are on ee if not run,Bad

4351,i have had broadband phone and tv deals with almost every company out there over the talktalk is by far the internet connection and i use that term very loosely is so inconsistent and weak it is are never any notices from their customer service when maintenance is scheduled or networks are down in an effort to add insult to injury when you call to ask about the issues they inform you that it is the fault of your it was that my phone may be too old and is having connectivity it being less than a month out of the best excuse was that it must be my house the signal isnt built to travel through multiple walls and therefore it isnt a service issue on their when i informed the agent i lived in a one room studio apartment that made for quite an awkward service if you can call it that zero accountability for inadequate network coverage the jewel in their crown is that they wont change prices mid contract like some bigger even charging a lower rate is extortion for the service suggest any stronger that a person looking for a new broadband provider avoids this organisation,Bad
4352,very disappointed with customer services i bought a phone and call package years ago for my wife its her phone and i simply pay the bill she wanted to upgrade the phone and we were offered a reasonable recycle payment and so we went for the upgrade then we were surprised to learn that you cant simply switch the sim because the new phone uses a different format hence you have to mess about backing up and transfering your data through the cloud so i need to set up another account and then you have to switch phone number over to a new sim which we were not sure how to do without losing use of the phone for a day so my wife goes to an o shop with all the account information and logon details but they would not help her unless the bill payer was present and i am overseas on business meanwhile time is ticking by and now they are threatening to withdraw the recycle offer and the value offered has already dropped by nearly clearly they are trying to rush us into making the change which we cant do because its too complicated and they wont help because i am not available to do it in person very shabby customer service and why not warn me of this mess before i order the upgrade if you think youre going to upgrade painlessly its probably no more difficult than switching provider so i would consider a new deal,Bad
4353,hello you for such a lovely reviewwe always appreciate any feedback from we can help with anything else please let us,Bad
4354,what a disgrace of a company i simply want to remove packages and have been trying to get through to them for months now i almost just feel like stopping paying to make them contact me,Bad
4355,i feel sorry for the talktalk support teams having to deal with this worthless product,Bad
4356,hii really upsets the way i have treated despite i have renewed my contract and the new customers get better deal than me i loved the service but really hate the customers service its nightmare never listen to youi only use the broadband in my grounds floors but cant use it upstairs bedroom and paying expensive bill even after i lost my job in the pandemic i wanted to change the package but no one listening at,Bad
4357,talk talk rang me and asked if i wanted to upgrade to fibre i said yes engineer and a new router would be turned up waited a few weeks with no communications from talk talk i started getting emails from talk talk telling me i can upgrade to i log into my account and my contract is now on the new fibre contract but im on the same speeds as before so after a lengthy chat with support i got this out of them so ive just had a look into this for you and firstly i must apologise for the lack of communication you have received regarding this thus far i can see notes about the upgrade but it appears that the order has been rejected for now due to the line not being capable of the full fibre speeds at the have be nice to let the customer account is still saying i have the new fibre package as well time to find a new broadband provider i think i dont care this happened i care that talk talk couldnt be bothered to sent one piece of communication telling me,Bad
4358,this is an update to my last review and frankly not only reinforced my view but has ensured i will not be staying with this company the set top box i had failed third in years as the failed after battling through customer services telling me it was a line fault which it clearly wasnt then saying i had to do a factory reset nearly an hour and a half later they finally accepted the box was faulty this was at approximately pm i was told i should have the replacement the following day as it was before pm it came days later on plugging it in however it wouldnt start up went into maintenance mode i went through the reset option without any change so i contacted customer services again told them the new box was faulty i was then informed without preamble that the box was not faulty i just didnt know how to set it up needed to be talked through how to plug in leads press buttons then came he inevitable line check on reconnecting with the chat service a different agent necessitating everything again there followed the usual rubbish until the agent finally said it was faulty after close to an hour frankly im totally unimpressed with being insulted by some person sitting staring at a screen following online prompts not listening reading what i had said to the point that they asked questions i had already given the answer to now for context i am a former it technician a help desk operator for pc network software issues had i done my job the way this company does i would have been sacked in very short order particularly after insulting a customer this experience has guaranteed that i will be taking my business elsewhere im not interested in a company that has agents who dont listen a system that has to be followed to the letter without deviation this was what the second agent told me takes up time i would sooner spend doing something more constructive like counting fuzz on a caterpillar by touch my time is important sitting being frustrated by slow replies complete rubbish i can do without,Bad
4359,one is to much was on the phone again to day give the man all my details to make shore its was ok this still was let me in i rang yesterday another hours wasted i will ring to mower i want to leave bt from day one soon take my money will never use bt again the serves is so bad when you do get to talk to a person are not doing the job at all the years no trouble with my old never had at all i dont or face book how you charge for a paper bill each month as well should be ashamed,Bad

4361,now is someone in your company really trying to wind me up i cant use my cards online as the text comes to this phone i cant get online to my account and you have just sent me an email to say my bill is ready however cannot reply to my email re the complaint and the fact that this is now the th day without it facebook or twitter spent another hours on phone yesterday to you and the complaint has been escalated and i have replied to any emails from u i need a phone now investigate oh the problem is not the mast not the sim card but your company sort it nowi have been a long term customer of tesco mobile and i am disgusted the way they have treated me lsat weekend i was a for a few days and no internet that i clearly pay for on tues my phone completely wouldnt work oh theres a nearby mast thats the issue will be fixed by yesterday email the mast is fixed however i called tesco again because the phone still wouldnt work to be advised the mast was not the issue i have emailed them a response to an email i asking further questions and days later still not had a reply and phone still not working what do i have to do to sort this matter from a large corporate company which i have been a client for years with,Bad
4362,service is still not up its been months activation date is still a month away tried calling customer service but they kept insisting they couldnt do anything until the activation date we now have no phone line or internet we have terminally ill relatives who struggle to get into touch with us now please whatever you do do not give these people your money they dont deserve it,Bad
4363,i cannot comment on the products because i was never even able to place an order customer services was nearly impossible to contact only in working hours when i was obviously working too via email the live chat was hopeless and callbacks took days and resulted in attempted different devices browsers and cards and both my banks confirmed they were not blocking the payment it was clearly a technical issue on the part of the bt shop but after a week of back and forth i was told they would not assist me any further and that is that i was trying to get a good deal on a new phone but genuinely after this experience i think i would rather spend the extra money with a different company,Bad
4364,thank goodness cocked up installation so i found out just how appalling they are before committed to a term with them hours on hold unbelievable miscommunication and shocking service you will never get any of my business,Bad
4365,i was advised of a go live date of the th july we are now in august and i still have not been connected everytime i call i am assured it will be connected and this hasnt been resolved i have agents give me timelines and then when nothing happens i chase only to be told different information continuous lies and still no service,Bad
4366,been a customer for over years and had the great idea of upgrading my broadband to fibre as we were out of contract never seen a company so reluctant to upgrade as we were out of contract we were being billed more as we expected so we asked for the upgrade in may to then hear that the package has been cancelled without notice and that we are paying fees of now up to thought it couldnt get any worse wrong keep in mind we have booked this package five times only for it to be cancelled by the vengeful spirit that is lurking in our talk talk account this is without mention of the poorly trained staff times we were put through to the wrong department oh you need to speak to someone about technical issues let me put you through to sales instead and you have to give your details every time like your crossing the border lets not forget the depressing music that makes me rethink why i ever chose talktalk in the first place that for over months coupled with extreme bills and mind numbing call and hold times over h in some cases as well as rude staff im at wits end with this company we finally get an engineer booked through who was told to give us an box for fibre even though they knew we had one which caused us to not have any internet for the past days because the box wasnt registered hours of calls and hopeless responses finally lead us to the problem they dont know we were finally told that if we wanted to upgrade it would take another month due to the problems made by inconsistent employees on the other line as our situation is so dire that now the higher ups have to be involved honestly not worth my time id rather speak to the am feeling sorry to all the new customers that will soon go through this talktalk will do anything but talk,Bad
4367,dont bother with them if you want to use pay as you go ive been using a few months and even though i did store my debit card details it can never find them meaning it cant when it should it then takes money off my remaining balance lost through the night for no good reason as the phone was idle and connected to my wifi and didnt lose connection for even a microsecond customer service is a bad joke,Bad

4369,there are a bunch of idiots sitting in vodafone who do not understand the customers issue and are just doing small lip service for the sake of their have been chasing them to clarify the reason for outstanding amount since the last months every time i get a bill but no emailed all the previous mail exchanges to them have been getting a call on each email sent but non of the rep took the effort to check the actual i hear from them is that i have to pay why what for how no one has a say they will get back with details but never of incompetent jerks,Bad

4441,very slow and totally unhelpful service from the inept agent i dealt with via the talk talk live chat facility on their website a complete waste of time would not recommend using this method of contacting talk talk however they offer no address for emailing enquiries instead seem to have a deliberate policy of getting you to speak to an agent on the phone who then will try their utmost to flog you a deal instead of dealing with your initial concern a horrible experience and ive heard of worse incidents from friends who also have dealt with talk talk customer services,Bad
4442,ee network is attractive due to its extensive mobile reception coverage across the uk after years of payg and a year contract i moved on to another company after many issues during the year contract initially i called to get my handset unlocked as i was traveling for a few months the call centre employee in india said it would be unlocked within weeks nothing happened so after weeks i requested again after another weeks i requested the time when it eventually got unlocked i then realized they charged me for the each time i also asked if the calls i was making to request unlocking would cost me anything from the country i was calling from to which the answer was no to look at the same bill for the that they charged me a total of for the numerous phone calls to ee its safe to say i wasnt best pleased they later refunded me with all these extra costs but only in the manner of contract credit not cash or any other means of payment bye bye ee,Bad
4443,i really wish that i could award zero for this useless pack of morons i have been a loyal customer since approx for the last two years i have endured significant disruption to my services not much fun when you are working from home usually one or two drops per week but recently or in one day vodafone support is moronic they tell you to take the faceplate off your master socket and thats it no real investigation i have just changed isp and went live last friday still issues but they identified the problem and sent out to investigate they found several faults at the cab at my home and its all fixed now pour your money down the drain rather than go with these clots its far less painful,Bad
4444,i signed up for talk talk a couple of years ago and for some reason the engineer couldnt install the services as i was wanting talk talk as a second phone line and service but engineer couldnt find the right wires in my walls so i returned the equipment as instructed and thought that was it all complete last month i signed up for and noticed that my rating is poor due to a talk talk default of over they closed the account right after issuing default so attempting a resolution wont help anything they have also used my dob incorrectly and this looks like im trying to use false details to obtain credit i never actually received any services and therefore never paid any bills due to failed installation yet they think its okay to file a default and ruin someones credit for seven or eight years they never even issued debt letters just closed my account made up an owed figure and issued a default inputting my dob wrong and then closed the default account so it couldnt be edited and even if i paid it now just to clear name not because i owe it it would remain where it is so i was advised by third party just to ignore it until i also know another person who had a similar issue they said everything was connected without an engineer visit but there was no broadband or phone line ever installed just a router and tv box in the post and talk talk wanted over early termination when they joined another company who actually installed a line and waste your time if you value your credit score they issue defaults before they issue your bills and charge you for forgetting to install or being unable to install services im just glad i sent the equipment back or my debt would probably be ridiculously stupid what exactly did they terminate to generate the charges when nothing was ever will be seeking legal advice to get this rectified even if it wont have any effect on my rating,Bad
4445,absolutely appalling service so far been waiting for over a week to hear why the internet service cannot be set up move into a new house recently and was told it would be a plug in and go service since then it has been constant delays with bt blaming open reach today after the th call weve made to them they have said next monday we will now get an update that will be weeks since we should have had internet very very poor,Bad

4452,my wife is in tears right now all we want to do is cancel our virgin media internet however to do so virgin insists we call my wife has been on the phone times today and each time she has been in the que for over mins the alternative is to write a letter no email address this company should be avoided this really stinks virgin it as difficult as possible for customers to leave ill be getting advice on this matter tonight will be spent sitting in a que hoping someone picks up and helps never never never response to virgins reply we had the whats app web page and phone going at the same time after a few days of trying and eventually making contact with what must have been a bot we were told we cant cancel our service via whats app it has to be via phone call or by have all this evidence on my wifes whats app i am totally disgusted by this again,Bad
4453,im having the worst experience ever while being robbed by talktalk i pay my bill but dont get what i pay for it doesnt just drop in speed it cuts off fully and when you play any kind of competitive tournament what use is that i contacted them by email they replied saying please you online chat with a link to online chat well that was ok until the online chat takes all your details then says everyone is busy with no options of waiting for somebody why are other people being served but im not good enough yet my money is though,Bad

4458,poor services in all senses not very happy with virgin,Bad
4459,we have had ee broadband for weeks it has never worked correctly ie no wifi at all when we have spoke to ee they said that as the speed coming into the property was ok that it would be a router issue we made an appointment with ee for an engineer to attend with a new router the engineer didnt turn up and they didnt inform us that they werent coming so we phoned again and they couldnt attend that day and that the engineers arent able to install new routers so either the first ee employer was incompetent or they didnt have a clue what they were doing basically do not use ee for your broadband the service is shocking and so is the quality of their broadband,Bad
4460,do not use virgin media unless you want unnecessary hard search on your credit went through the process of searching for broadband and almost take went with virgin my other half suggested i check reviews before completing sign up at which point i came here and read the horror stories listed i did not complete set up and yet still they have added a hard search to my credit file where on the tc does it state they hard search and no other provider does this hard search are provided for credit cards mortgages etc not a pcm direct debit set to speak so someone on the phone is infuriating and i was cut off after being told i need to speak some in another department no response to didnt even complete then process with them and i know have this issue and no support,Bad
4461,still waiting for correct package to be installed even though paying astronomical prices,Bad
4462,most of the month our internet has been appalling and cant connect and have to use my phones data disgusting considering im paying u over a month had problems for few month now and its getting worse sick of ringing up to be told the same rubbish,Bad
4463,the customer service was really rude ee should have to screen people with nasty attitude they should not really work in customer service if they cant even explain in a nice way,Bad
4464,absolutely terrible company service and signal is non existent i constantly rely on using whats app to make calls which is a free service i have made many complaints to about my signal they just tell me to use the wifi app which makes no difference i have now gone to the ombudsman as i cannot wait for my contact to end with this st company oh and i cannot believe they have the cheek to put their prices up dramatically whilst we are all struggling with the cost of living crisis,Bad
4465,obtained a second hand phone which had ee sim card inserted with still on it i tried ringing my home phone to test and it a couple of weeks later tried again only to discover the credit had gone phoned customer services but they said it had can a company accept payment for a service then not honour it disgusting dishonest company dont use ee they are money grabbing reptiles ee sucks,Bad
4466,would give zero stars if had a terrible experience with virgin media before but it was the only broadband available in my area so i begrudgingly entered into a month contract with than weeks into the contract the service was down for over hours as i work from home and couldnt be without internet for days i had to pay extra for data on my mobile supposedly amazing fibre internet doesnt work on the bedroom feet away from the customer service goes from bad to downright now having to leave my place due to an issue with a neighbour where im not feeling safe in my flat so tried to transfer the service to my new address however their service is not available at the new flat only min walk from my current one and when trying to find out what to do the people ive spoken on the phone were incredibly unhelpful and rude so now in addition to the stress of moving ill be short because virgin media doest cover my new area they didnt even try to pretend they cared worst customer service ive ever experienced,Bad
4467,ive emailed with a simple query at their on july and followed up yesterday on that however there has been no interest or response from customer support if it exists not sure about the positive reviews about customer service being posted here,Bad
4468,dont know where to start with open the last two installations ive had the miss fortune of coming into contact with many by open reach they are cowboys and hobby arrogant ones at that all they are interested in is installing whatever they are doing as quick and as rushed as possible no then going home they have a list of excuses for shoddy work when confronted bt open reach plays lip service to complaints in fact it doesnt take complaints directly and you have to complain to your service just a shame that every internet provider uses open reach and their engineers are you get an install by them and you like things installed correct level and not have cables thrown up boxes stuck in the middle of the wall etc basically stand over the engineers shoulders and dont let them get away with it if you dont they will throw it up as quick and a shoddy as possible and be left with sorting it out,Bad
4469,absolutely one of the worst decisions i have ever made consider carefully if this service will be compatible with accessing work it services such as via a vpn after one month of frustration have finally solved this issue by purchasing my own router at extra cost to myself from amazon,Bad
4470,stay away from this company months we are trying to change the account ownership and the system they have in place does not allow the new owner to get any update about the application they have been playing with us for months they admitted that they have an error in their system and months they do addition to this they overcharge the current account and due to their technical error no update can be done they promised that they will refund for this the overcharge is more than pounds and they said they will refund only shame on you talk talk i have been you client for years,Bad
4471,i have run out of words for what i think of talktalk customer recently moved house my new services did start on the st as arranged thats good thing the services at my old house should have ended same day but theyre still on on web chat i explained this at the start of the conversation but was told rest assured that when i move services they will end at my old address and start with the new told this despite having allready informing them makes me wonder if they can even understand english so with talktalk ive wasted hours of my time trying to arrange my change of the future i avoid talktalk mainly because of their incompetence,Bad
4472,ill start with the good point that over the month contract the broadband was faultless good speed so no need to contact them during the term however i knew my contract was coming to an end and i didnt want it to renew as i was getting an unbeatable price from another provider so i followed the correct procedure and when in my final days i rang them to let them know not to renew the contract as i would be leaving them this was fine and i was assured that the cancellation is in place i even received a text and email confirming this so all seemed good but imagine my shock when i get a bill for june when my contract ended in may i spoken to them again and they said ignore the bill as it will not debit and guess what it did debit so i read online that a final bill will be generated days after termination that time has passed and no final bill when i log on its clear that i have no services so why am i paying for june when im getting absolutely nothing from bt so after about another hour on the phone i speak to a guy who told me to ask my bank to claim the money back cancel my direct debit and when the debt collection agency contact me im to show them proof of termination so the bt advisors are advising me to get into the books of debt collection can you believe that ive just got a mortgage and i know even something small like that can impact me when i need some sofa finance shocking advice however as the call went on he found my account and now i have to pay for june even though im getting nothing from them but then at the end of june my final bill will be produced and it will have the refund on it we will see about this as i have no confidence in them this was a standard contract term end so it should have gone plain sailing however bt cant even do these day to day things correctly ill be avoiding bt in the future good broadband but shocking customer service on easy requests,Bad
4473,if youre thinking about joining think again theyre the worst mobile network provider i have ever been with i managed to end my month contract with them after months because of their dreadful service i will never recommend to anyone customer service is almost as bad as the phone reception even now weeks after terminating my contract and sending my phone and sim back theyre still sending me bills to pay if i could give them stars i would,Bad
4474,worst customer service i have ever received in me entire life intermittent connection can go off for days randomly and the customer service technicians cant even be arsed to look into it for you all they do is send you another or a technician who on arrival just tell you the obvious which is that its not a problem at the address you would think about having what is probably close to technicians in the past months that they would communicate this back to the customer service team but oh no they have no idea what they technicians have said the problem is today was no different was put through to nd line who said it was a problem on my line and that i would receive a call back shortly which never happened i rang back several hours later and now they are saying its an area fault which will probably make it the second or third area fault this month which wont be fixed for another few days another few days of paying for a service that i am no receiving thanks virgin wish i had never gone with them in the first place,Bad
4475,the worst customer service ive never seen after a couple of month guys coming trying to setup the line calls chats and several email i decided to never got internet and now they send me an invoice never talktalk dont send me to have a chat on the website im already friend with all of the team,Bad
4476,waited two weeks for an engineer to install internet took a half day of work i had to ring them for them to tell me there was a problem with their system thats why i havent had an engineer out to install my internet take your business elsewhere honestly,Bad
4477,after decided to sign up with talk talk and i had a go live date for the th july i took a day off work to have the service installed but no engineer turned up after trying times to call the engineer the phone just rung talk talk who was on the line to open reach and they said they could not get access to my property that was the first lie as my living room chair looks out of my window onto my pathway which is quite long nobody turned up now they are saying theres extra work needed in the is more annoying is that they have given me a new date th july but my old provider has now disconnected my service if talk talk get it right the first time what hope is there for another time luckily i was with virgin and they have had to reconnect my service but have had to pay an extra connection fee may be think twice if a deal is to good it probably is,Bad
4478,worst network ever when i am in office i cannot hear anyone calling me on my mobile not recommended,Bad
4479,hi pauline thank you so much for taking the time to review us and we are so happy to hear you are enjoying your services and your nee package please continue to keep us updated and we will endeavour to continue providing you with the best service we can thank you ash,Bad
4480,on phone for over told they were reducing my bill last got bill still the said could not find my,Bad
4481,dont ever go with virgin media worst company ever supposed to be paying for a service as promised but not receiving any of it have complained on numerous occasions and have had nobody call or email me back as promised appalling customer service i would definitely think twice about signing up with vm stick with other networks,Bad
4482,i am very disappointed with the o service on august was debited from my account without notice i tried to get that money back for several weeks the money was drawn during my one vacation a year which meant a broken vacation for me and my child and also i had financial problems because of this three people who served me in they did not keep their word and the money did not return to my account as promised they only finally got a refund when i wrote a complaint all of my family have been regular customers for over years i felt robbed and cheated by this company my losses that i have suffered in connection with this situation are not fully taken into account by the person receiving my complaint i am very disappointed and this is my last contract with this company,Bad
4483,i have been with talktalk ever since they started and now after over years or so i have just today cancelled my contract i have to say that despite the early days of troubles i have had a good steady service over the past couple of years cannot say much about some of the reps i have spoken to in the past as they seemed to be reading from a text book like a robot rather than understanding my problem and offer me solutions in my experience talktalk does not look after their loyal customers a bit too late to understand that i may admit when they upgrade their equipment they forget existing customers and if you want the new ones you have to beg for it like the last time i renewed they offer fixed price but in reality it is not because any discount that they offer at the beginning is excluded so you will end up paying more last time i fixed it at m but ended up with m by the end of the contract which will increase to m next month the most important issue is the speed which in my case they could not offer any more than at least in my area cr you would think that years should be enough time for a faster service so today i cancelled my contract the nice loyalty rep tried very hard to convince me to stay by offering me discounts and free bits but i had to refuse because my new isp offers me over times faster speed at half the price i current pay to talktalk meanwhile a more disappointing thing was that they are going to send me a free return package to return the outdated old tv equipment that i am sure i paid for years ago and they advised that if i dont return the equipment i will be charged for it how nice will i ever come back to talktalk you may ask well i wont be talking to talktalk any more for perhaps the next years that is for sure,Bad
4484,wanted to cancel so was treated like a saying because i hadnt answered they would terminate the how poor the broadband is,Bad
4485,talktalk very unhelpful and insisting we pay them money we are not due and that they would then refund it but if we did not pay it we would get an extra charge for late payment and that would result in a black mark on our credit informed them more than days that we were moving address and wanted to disconnect our line and as we were moving to a location they could not provide a service we would be terminating our contract all good so far apart from being bombarded with requests to keep using moving we received a bill for advance payment for the period after we moved so contacted them to say they had got it wrong but they insisted it was a bill automatically generated and would be refunded once paid i ask so why pay it if you have to refund it answer because you have to otherwise late payment fee applied and black mark on credit belief and after an hour online arguing the logic they would not not recommend talktalk to anyone absolute rubbish customer service glad i am away from them,Bad
4486,do not go near these lead me into buying into their product and i decided to cancel immediately and a lewis and isla have continually harassed me total scam artists,Bad
4487,as a family weve been with bt for years and have shares in the virgin media came about we jumped ship still keeping our shared with going into my life story i recently returned to bt and i can confirm british telecom is one of the worst companies to be with and i totally regret having any of my services with them,Bad

4500,total waste of time and having issues with broadband dropping at all hours of the day for months when you try sorting out the issue you can never get the problem sorted and they try to upgrade your service at your cost why would i want to pay more money for a service that im not getting at the price im paying at the moment they are quick enough to take my money but cant be bothered to sort the issues out lastly for a company called talktalk trying to speak to an actual person within the company is like mission i will be leaving this company at the end of the month thankfully no option for zero stars hence the one star,Bad
4501,one star is way too much for this horrible company every interaction i have had with this vodafone has been a bad experience which has left me stressed and hating them even more they send you round in circles as does their website and you just have to keep repeating the same facts every time they pass the ball to someone else it appears their main aim is to keep customers no matter what cost to their reputation i have been lied to on a number of occasions and threatened if i cancelled my direct debit even though my contract with them had expired i am still trying to extract myself from them by unlocking my phone but the company i have paid to unlock is unable to obtain the unlock number from the carrier ie vodafone they are having to go back to the manufacturer at the same time vodafone text constantly saying i need to renew my bundle lucky i am now on pay as you go but even then they are less than transparent i would advise anyone to stay well clear i have turned my phone off until i can get them out of my life,Bad
4502,aweful company they make friendly replies on trustpilot to fool readers requesting to send then an email so they can sort problems same rubbish service as they just ignore emails afterwards they just try to look good on here all theyre doing is for you to mis the statutory cancellation period by dragging it beware if you ever try to cancel theyll give you the run just hope a lot more unhappy people would come over here and leave bad reviews may be then the management will take notice as currently they seem to be sleep,Bad

4504,contacting o for a year because of the bed service no one wanna help sending me new sim everytime the problem is not with the sim but with the phone and they understand that but not willing to help taking them to court,Bad
4505,honestly the worst experience ive ever had was given a go live date of todays date is and still no home broadband service available complete shambles and being off every time i call them to chase up whats going on why dont you do all the checks prior to giving someone a go live date instead you tell your customers that they are going live on a certain date then you try to activate the line on the day only to find out engineers need to be called out to rectify issues complete and utter pointless exercise avoid these clowns like i will never advise anyone to go with talktalk so long as there is breath in my lungs,Bad
4506,i had to cancel within a month of signing up to them my speed kept dropping and line going down it was affecting my ability to work from home i am currently without a service i spoke to a manager called adrian who had customer service skills and more concerned with threatening me rather than helping me i was on the phone for an hour and minutes trying to cancel my contact and wast cut off times that is why i asked to speak to a manger in the end the worst manager i have ever spoken with from his attitude i can see why the company is so bad and they are getting so many bad reviews,Bad

4558,have had vodafone broadband for near a year and no issues until a couple of weeks ago when i started experiencing dropouts out internet working from home so obviously was a little nervous about the issue got onto customer service useless chat sessions to talk to customer service go through usual test line is good no issues detected and after telling them that it had just dropped again got told that they see no issue went and purchased a new router as i had read this can be the issue with vodafone broadband at time and for a couple of days seemed to settle the issue problems started occurring again at the weekend and got back onto customer services got the same responses but now also informed that the issue was my fault as i was using my personal router refuse to even listen when telling them that experiencing the same issues with new router so probably a fault along the line just got ignored and had to persevered with the internet i was getting until today internet dropped just before a client call managed to use a hotspot via my mobile to get through the call but after that phoned to cancel as getting really annoyed with the quality and lack of action told there would be an early termination fee and happily paid it to get away from this useless service virgin broadband ordered in minutes and due to be delivered by the end of the week can only hope this experience goes better,Bad
4559,staff on chat agreed to fix problem but instead went on lunch while i was told to stay on hold for mins waste of time takes hours to get any answers to problem but minutes to sell you a new package sell you high speed package when its not possible to receive higher speed,Bad

4562,ive entered into a fixed price contact for a tv and broadband package being told not to worry about price increases for the term of the contract years i have twice had to make contact with talk talk due to their changes and increasing my charges they then start changing the terms of the contract and saying the tv package is not included and that i cannot add on additional features or obtain a voucher its totally unacceptable a contract is a contract if they cant honour it they shouldnt offer it if they make changes to the service its not the customers fault in a fixed price contract the price should not increase during the terms of the contract,Bad
4563,i have been with talktalk through several years and three businesses i am on my third and a writer despite attractive offers from other service providers i have always found their customer service to be excellent until that is the extremely poor experience i had in february this year i rang to complain about a price rice which i considered unjust as i had been assured in october last year that my contract price would remain fixed for the duration of the contract and yet here it was going up not a huge rise but the principle remains the same as having been implemented once it can be repeated i found the agent i spoke to hostile and unpleasant and was told first that my time for complaining had run out it hadnt and when i replied that i could prove it hadnt he then told me that i had been given the wrong information at the outset of the contract and that was that when i replied that misinformation was not my problem but that of talktalk he told me basically that i had only two options which amounted to accept the price rise or leave ie ship in or ship out not his actual words but the tone was quite clear when i asked to speak to a manager he said there werent any no line managers and he was the only person i could talk to when i then asked for customer service he asked why and said that i could only talk to them if i wanted to cancel my contract i decided this was a losing game and so wrote enclosing proof of the timescales etc to the head of complaints at the chief executives office at the address both on the internet and in a national paper sending the letter by special delivery the letter was returned to me by royal mail marked addressee gone away with wasting my time and energy i am now doing out my time after all the years of loyalty until my contract expires when i will seek another provider ironically money supermarket have informed me that i could have left at any time during the days after notification of a price rise with no financial penalty for cancelling my contract the thirty days have sadly now expired and so i am trapped angry and very disappointed today i had a very different experience back to the past with a really pleasant online chat representative who was courteous and helpful admittedly i was only asking some innocuous questions but it was still a pleasant experience unlike the earlier one i endured in february,Bad
4564,never use this company ive been a customer with virgin for years back from when it was cable wireless i have been treated appallingly the last few months i have my broadband tv telephone and two mobile contracts with them and i spend over per month one of the mobile contract phones has been sent back for repair times in less than a year for the same fault the charging port stops working it has now broken again for the th time after it was repaired a few weeks ago i asked them if i could send the handset back and if they could send me a refurbished handset that was reliable but they refused they said the only option i had was to pay to end the mobile contract and start a new one which i refused all i asked for was a refurbished phone after weeks of trying to get a manager to call me i got very depressed and ended up sending the phone back for repair as i had no other option they then returned the phone back to me unrepaired and said if i wanted it repaired i would have to pay because apparently it is moisture damaged but this was never detected the previous times it was in for repair over the last year this phone has never been in any contact with any moisture so i am now left with a broken phone which i have to pay for every month until february when the contract ends their customer service team is appalling in the way they treat their long term customers they are only interested in their new customers so they will now be losing me as a customer for their appalling behaviour which will be a loss to them of over per year because they wouldnt send me a refurbished phone i am so pleased i will not be dealing with this company any longer,Bad
4565,do not transfer to this company was promised new phones its been months and no new handsets took over my phone line leaving me with no handsets and did not pay my termination fee with old phone contract now stuck with them and not happy at all my previous review was forced on promise if i left a good review i would get new cases free with my new handsets but not even had handsets no handsets no cases dont be fooled like i was,Bad

4579,no stars worse than bad there are no words to describe the frustration and anger i feel towards this company they have left my elderly parents without a landline and a great big hole outside of their house no explanation as to why it was suddenly cut off no information as to when the issue will be resolved no promise of compensation and no apology they were however asked by talk talk to call them later on in the week for an update it is utterly mind blowing in the worst way if you are thinking of using them think elsewhere for you own health and safety absolutely appalling company,Bad
4580,my keeps disconnecting from the wifi and will not reconnect for some time considering im paying for a service i dont feel like im getting it,Bad
4581,im writing this review after already spending minutes trying to talk with someone from customer services and answers the phone i finally managed to talk with someone from the webchat who called me instead but said that she had to transfer the call to someone else when that happened the call was disconnected the time remaining to be chatting with a customer services adviser also jumps from minutes to minutes back to and then back to againi just want to call them to let them know that i no longer want to be a customer but even this seems to be an ordeal,Bad
4582,leatherhead want to sell you something any queries batted for a contact phone i tried it at home there we more barriers than the grand bother going in unless you want to buy something or you try your luck with a chat to us service thats always engaged probably with problems,Bad
4583,awful service they also do not honour your legal rights based on their own called to give months notice to end my contract which expires in june only to be told that their system would not allow them to do it and i could not give that much notice this after spending so long on hold only to be told to call back in months is ridiculous they even admitted that it is because of their systems only that they will not accept my notice nowhere does it say you have to give notice within a specific period clear contract infringement of being able to give notice at a minimum of days notice ill be taking this further to the ombudsman,Bad
4584,i run a small business needing wifi about weeks ago the wifi failed trying to get through to talk talk was a trial they couldnt find me even though i paid on a monthly basis eventually they sent a router which did not work and then a engineer was sent after many telephone calls it then worked but i have to reset on a daily a happy customer,Bad

4586,very unsatisfactory dealings with talktalk regarding a longstanding problem with my freeview box disappointing because id previously had a good experience with upgrading broadband etcetera,Bad
4587,was completely incapable of answering the simplest questions i wanted to know what tv and boost was for and his reply was is for tv and the boost is i have just wasted minutes of my life chatting with him and still have no idea what talktalk are offering so back to google to find a company that is clear and concise on their web site,Bad
4588,do apologize for the poor communication youve had with our teams when trying to request an order cancellation as this is not the professional type of service we aim to you need further support please contact us on twitter or facebook talktalk or via our online community pages here and we will look into this for social team,Bad
4589,believe me if i could give a minus i the end of september beginning of october we were without both wifi and land line telephone with no notification what so ever from lasted for consecutive rang them constantly to complain and point out that at the time we had a very sick and vulnerable adult in our care and we needed our land line to contact people or for them to be able to contact uswe were told upgrades were being made and we would benefit from this explains again and again in the end i gave up it was an extremely stressful emotional as helpless time i didnt need at the end of someones lifei complained to virgin again x to be told we would be compensated for this it never happens so i e mailed got my reply this quote what is written on the tried to ring you about the result of your recent complaint but we couldnt get suggest you reboot your rest my am totally heartbroken that such a company could react in such a heartbreaking manner i will be i responded to the response virgin gave me they were so eager to point out how brilliant they were at resolving morning i get an automated text you problem resolved for yes for not resolved virgini rest my case,Bad
4590,disgusted to see talk talk bully who arent tech savvy my dad wanted to end the contract to be told he could only do it from the landline not his mobile phone they do not even have a an awfully inaccessible service you offer to good paying long term customers you should be absolutely ashamed now threatening them with admin fees must make you feel so mighty bullying disabled pure vile it is clear that importance for the bottom line outweighs your concern for customer well being,Bad
4591,my contract was coming to an end and virgin wanted to increase my price to per month after searching i found more competitive prices i called virgin media to ask if there was anything that they could do with the price and they went away and said there was something they could do with the price increase it to needless to say i went elsewhere,Bad
4592,rubbish service poor customer service and overpriced id happily move provider if there was any real alternative avoid,Bad
4593,please do not fool yourselves about this horrific we have been paying for mbs download but the max we were getting was mbs its a scam ever since we have applied to this terrible provider we have been having several major issues which havent been resolved dispite several effortless tries from the company,Bad
4594,warning theyve now started offering engineer visits to upgrade to mbs and above only for the engineer not to turn up when you call they say the last person didnt click confirm ill do that now and heres your new date and the same thing will happen we called a different team and it turns out those dates are provisional which basically means you dont have a confirmed date that would be fine if they told us that in the first place i firmly believe this is just to string you along as they dont have enough engineers why not just tell us that unless we would leave for another company they really are just liars this is after breaking contract by putting up our bill by only to be too happy to put it down again if youre willing to call them forget the prices because theyre meaningless,Bad
4595,money grabbing thieves who dont care about their customers avoid,Bad
4596,consistently fails to achieve the low standards it sets itself,Bad
4597,price increase unethical and dont reply with some nonsense about investment in infrastructure this is simply opportunistic revenue increase by a company that doesnt need to do it because terms state inflation if a company like this actually did the right thing and just put a low acceptable price increase in place imagine the brand and customer loyalty that would be generated versus competitors but no short term gain wins i can afford it but to many this will be difficult for them you should be ashamed of yourselves ee and if i was an employee i would expect a pay rise if management had any perhaps everyone else is at it if only you could strike as a to my review above based on the response below i understand you have corporate delivered scripting you must use when responding to reviews i am sure you have a corp comms department i also imagine you are going home at the moment questioning why your employer makes you spout such spurious garbage,Bad
4598,im honestly lost for words bad enough that wont get censored on here to describe how awful their customer services are across their phone live chat and text service platforms trust me i tried them all stay well clear if you are in anyway human and have things to do with your time,Bad

4600,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
4601,keep getting charged for premium numbers on my phone contacted o last month they told me all premium numbers had been removed but here i am month later with the same issues again contacted o with same complaint but again lied to again and with a right attitude how people stay with this company the way the my treat there customers ive been with o years and cant wait to leave this shabby so called company and hope everyone out there does the same so they end up with nothing which is more than they deserve,Bad
4602,was told via email that my monthly subscription will be going up in december rang virgin to get a better deal and they could only offer me per month from how on earth do you think you can keep your long standing customers i rang to finish my package deal and now have a new supplier at a much reduced price im still receiving virgin broadband and tv i feel my request has been ignored and i will be stopping my direct debt payments the ombudsman will also hear from me the service you supply is the worst these days and i am not the only one who is so disappointed with virgin media,Bad
4603,this company is extremely simply stop your account without any notice when you call them they reply they need days to solve this days without your means days without being connected to outside no reason before any measure they take they should send notification with justification,Bad
4604,horrendous customer service poor service unable to contact when need resolutions appalling company,Bad
4605,worst i have been complaining about a problem with hub and still not fixed leaving them soon,Bad
4606,i have been with talktalk since they took over ntl and as i am now a pensioner i can no longer afford their price increases so i sent a email to the ceo but got no reply so i then phoned and was told i am speaking to consultants in the phillipines who had no idea how to help me and kept giving me different people to talk to and as i am hard of hearing the line reception was so poor i could not understand what they were saying and this went on for minutes and in the end they made me a offer which is still to high so i will see if any other broadband wants to help me,Bad
4607,omg terrible service open reach booked to call out he said i need a new router now they want to book another engineer for a second opinion he didnt show now want to book again rd time staying in and still no internet dont use there online bot every call is mins waiting and being passed around,Bad
4608,messed up the port over and continue to make a mess of of services and now the billing looks like a total phone calls explained the issue several times still not providing a satisfactory outcome i suspect they will not read this review as they simply do not care about any of their port back to ee as soon as possible,Bad
4609,i switched to bt from virgin after i was left without service thoughout the easter weekend in cancelled virgin and got the basic broadband and phone package adding on with the first months being to mention that i would still have to pay line rental despite advert saying completely free i let that one slide installed it all myself and no the first week of december bt vision box tried to do an update and got stuck in a loop so turning on and off at wall to try and jump start it which did not work phoned customer care and i use that term very loosely who said it was a problem with the junction box and they were fixing to say it wasnt that so i phoned back and requested a new refused to send one and insisted on an engineer being sent to have a look this appointment was made on christmas eve still another weeks away to which i grudgingly agreed christmas eve comes and no show by the engineer and i phone bt again to find out why was told by someone who could barely speak english tell me that because it was xmas eve then engineer was not working i was extremely angry that i had been lied to and would be without service throughout xmas and new year because next appointment was rd of january they then proceeded to tell me that it was obviously my fault and therefore would be retro charged the to fix one had shown up to see what the problem was i cancelled my dd and informed them that i was now withholding payment and for every day they failed to come and fix it days so far plus anything coming i would fail to pay which is legally binding they told me to ring back on th december to arrange appointment because i cant be bothered to see if there are any appointments i go home in an hour so naturally i was outraged that this could go on an engineer eventually turned up on rd jan spent minutes looking at the box to which youre right love it was the dead which is what i had told bt days previous bt have sent me various bills with retro charges and made up charges to which i have complained times to bt and am now in the process of reporting to ofcom i was passed from pillar to post and must have spoken to at least different people tryin to get this sorted majority of whom spoke little or no english and bt are still trying to con me the second my contracts are up i am gone have never had service so poor,Bad
4610,company wont allow to cancel the plan through the website they make you lose hours on the phone waiting talking to different agents avoiding the topic and not only that on the phone they tell you x and they will do whatever they want later so they are going to make you call them again to lose more time exhausting if you have other options other than this garbage go for it,Bad
4611,we are paying so much each month for fibre optic wifi and the service is absolutely awful,Bad
4612,dont go near these ones bt is wat i call legal scam artists take ur money give ya in return keep ur money,Bad
4613,terrible customer service chat calls arent logged and you have to repeat yourself whenever you speak with an operative complaints team dont even bother to try and ring just send a text saying they cant get hold of you,Bad
4614,ridiculous charges just everywhere ridiculous charging me for extra equipment they randomly sent and refused to take back when i originally asked about it refusing to close down my account from the date i tried to contact them and instead only doing it from the date i got through on their absolutely useless customer fine while everything works but when something goes wrong or you need to cancel thats when things are absolutely awful with disappointed over,Bad
4615,signed up with talk talk back in april installation arranged for early may the box hadnt arrived and the engineers went to the wrong address rang and emailed to rearrange spoke to several customer service assistants over weeks who said they were rearranging the installation but didnt no contact for weeks from them despite me ringing and asking on an email to say they were closing the case despite not having the line installed so i had to explain all of the above for the seventh time via emails and phone call then received an email with a date for the line move had to email to say it wasnt a line move but an installation no response emailed again and finally this morning received an email to say they are changing it to an installation and they will be in touch to arrange a date so ive had no internet and ive been paying for the service since may absolute joke of a company totally incompetent,Bad
4616,i can only implore anybody thinking about taking services from bt,Bad
4617,when changing plans ee failed to cancel the old plan and have been charging me for it now for months pm despite three times assuring me that it will be cancelled and the overcharged amount returned i have written to the ceo and executive committee members and they dont even bother to very wary of this company as they appear to deliberately overcharge and it seems impossible to get your money back,Bad
4618,ive been trying to get my access to account for months no one at virgin want to know or can help me ive made complaints which have been closed with no resolution only advice to check my account on which i cant bloody access large company have lost sight of the customer experience,Bad
4619,as stated elsewhere absolutely the worst customer service and the billing is completely confusing they send emails stating payment dates and how much then take out more than stated and on different dates to there actual broadband is great but the customer service and getting to speak to someone who you can understand and can help is as bad as it gets terrible,Bad
4620,i wasted so much of my time trying to receive bt tv on my tv which should have been easy however their equipment and viewing platform is simply not up to the job i acquired several bt boxes and multiple sets of bt range plugs which are meant to successfully transmit the wifi tv signal from my router to my tv i also had a similar issue in my previous home on the opposite side of the uk i have suffered years of trying to watch a game of football on bt sport without the matches being constantly interrupted by a or frozen picture i now stream from the bt app to my tv i sent all of the equipment back to bt for recycling and they offered me just ten pounds in compensation which is an insult considering my experience terrible customer service and i cant wait to leave bt when my contract is up,Bad
4621,very unreliable service randomly speeds would drop its very strange because i had to pay to to the mg package because the mg package just didnt run smoothly but even with mg the tv wouldnt smoothly stream an hd video from youtube without going pixelated and that was plugged in to ethernet on top of that there were random very bad signal days which would load web pages slowly i had many work video calls that i had to save by using tethered g from my phone and the g signal in my area is not good not something i from paying per month for years what really takes the was that they only offered to reduce the price after i told them i was leaving to swap to not when i asked nicely months ago because they are charging too much for the service,Bad
4622,if it was possible to give stars i would absolutely terrible company would not recommend for any service i can think of,Bad
4623,virgin media customer service is terrible and useless no wonder why it has such a bad rating anyway recently i have been cut off from the broadband because someone from virgin put my address details on a wrong address and when that person from that address opened an account i have been cut off i called the customer service several times in order to be reconnected but no luck all the agents told me it will take h a few times but nothing happened and i am still without connection after weeks please do something to improve this as this is one of the worst experiences i had so far,Bad
4624,just trying to sort out a problem but simply cant they wont let you cant talk to anybody and cant sort out never had such horrendous service i really am shocked at the level of customer service i will definetly not renew with vodafone a disgrace,Bad
4625,on wednesday th april i tried to take out a mobile deal with virgin media which was per mth mth contract and included a amazon voucher i went through the hassle a lot of obtaining my pac code from my existing provider vodafone but eventually got it and tried to get the new virgin media deal online however after progressing through various stages i was told that there was a technical glitch and someone would be in tuesday rd may i decided that i had waited long enough and phoned virgin media with my order number to enquire what had happened to my order the lady admitted that it was a glitch at their side and she could complete the order over the phone when i asked about the amazon voucher she said that it was only available by doing the order online not over the phone so i said i would do this but then she told me that there is a glitch in the system so the online orders arent able to be processed so to clarify you can only get the amazon voucher via an online order but there is a glitch which prevents you successfully completing the process online when i asked if she would honour my order which i tried to make last wednesday with the voucher she said she wouldnt she could only do the deal without voucher is it just me or does this seem unjust,Bad
4626,absolute sham of a company complete and utter disgrace automatically set up a new contract despite us saying we didnt want one sent us a bill for called and were told it would be cancelled then it wasnt several call backs promised and of course not a single one called absolute disgrace,Bad

4629,customer service is last week i have had major problems with my internet package making it very difficult to work from home i contacted them and they did something whilst i was on the phone and now i have internet but they are sending an engineer out tomorrow why do i have to phone you for you then to provide me with the service i have been paying for it should work all the timei also raised that i had not received the amazon echo dot i ordered at the time of taking out the package i was told i had been sent a code by amazon but i have never been sent the code the call handler was rude and unhelpful and refused to assist i have to contact amazon but i have no contract or agreement with amazon you should be sorting this out talktalk your staff are also quite difficult to understand over the phone,Bad
4630,so far my experience of ee is that they have the worst customer service ever i cannot believe how poor the communication and timescales have been for such a simple task as processing an order for a new sim card i have had to wait nine days from the date of my original order when i emailed to chase the order i got no reply and when i finally phoned customer services i was on hold for mins then told that my order had not actually been dispatched after another mins without apology and consistent dispute of the facts i was then told i would have to wait another three days or after i suggested other companies can setup through a local store was told to go and collect it myself i was essentially told by a manager that i was lying about my order date and delivery terms which i have in an email from ee themselves the whole process has been a total shambles i have been inconvenienced for over a week have had to waste my time chasing an order that hadnt been processed and was then subjected to mins of arguing before finally being told to go and sort it out myself i would never dream of treating a new customer with such a lack of respect and decency ee you are a joke,Bad
4631,its a shame there isnt a zero star facility for this review as home would certainly be a zero or even minus star over phone for a service for and broadband connection in september to be fitted in time for my move to my house th th september no phone line no broadband and no open to morning spent hours on the phone to a technical guy who couldnt tell me much more than what i already know about setting up a router and how to test a phone to get my broadband or phone line no phone line broadband nearly a week later after hours on the phone at various times since then to be off onto various people on the phone and promised contact back by text email and nothing them today to cancel their services to be told that i am bound under a years contract and so have to pay the remaining charge which amounts to around have so far had no service from them so they hve broken the contract to supply me with any service and every time have blamed bt for the fault i shall be taking them to court and using bt as a witness to their away from this company they are very unprofessional on the phone and i am not one to be upset easily unhelpful people,Bad
4632,what a huge crock shifted from pillar to post anyone would think that you were trying to transfer gold bullion around get real christ then when finally able to get into the account i was transferred elsewhere and they tried to make me go through the whole thing again with the same of security questions furious is an understatement,Bad
4633,i have had constant issues with the fast broadband service for over a month dl speed of max mbps minimum when i try to resolve the issue i dont feel that you are really that interested,Bad
4634,i have been a customer for many years so when i recently bought a new phone i thought i would take advantage of their recycle your old phone to sell my iphone s and was disappointed when i get an email from them to say that they have had to adjust my quote because they found that the touch screen was phone was packaged up well had no cracks or chips and was fully working when i sent it so my first thought was that they had damaged it in there so i rejected the quote and they returned my phonei received my phone back and to my surprise and relief the touch screen has no defects and is working as it should i cannot find any issues or faults with it so its safe to say that simply lied to me for no apparent reason i will be changing providers as soon as i use up all my credit,Bad
4635,mast broken twice once for over weeks and now again over a week leaving me with no service and unusable internet i know its not owns infrastructure but they need to own faults and put pressure on their infrastructure provider which is o also i asked for compensation to for all the weeks i was unable to use the service and they responded with no real answer just want to rip customers off but not provide any compensation for issues that occur on the network going to cancel using them,Bad
4636,my virgin media broadband has been down now for consecutive days the necessary fix was identified after days of outage but the engineering work has not been done six dates have been promised to me for the service to be restored an engineer only showed up on one of these occasions but did not do the work the other five times were noone gets in touch from virgin i call in afterwards to find out if the work has been done and i am told that the work has been rescheduled usually for another three weeks awayi have been given a seventh promised date in days time but i have absolutely no confidence that this time will be any different it is like living in groundhog day i have called virgin times so far over the last few months to chase up wasting hours of my life i have raised written complaints to no effect i have tried escalating to more senior management to no effect i cannot stress strongly enough how disgracefully bad this ongoing experience is from virgin media,Bad
4637,what a shower of incompetence i lost broadband th aug no information available from bt just a suggestion i would be reconnected midnight th august a couple of calls to bt very difficult because the operator could not understand english i logged on from my mobile and noticed a promised call today th pm stayed with my phone no call no tv all week working from home and doing accounts is impossible and to top it have an autistic daughter who is or was always on line bt needs a good kick up the backside,Bad
4638,i think talk talk gives cheaper broadband than other providers but their customer service is unbelievably bad i think their call center is in india sometimes they dont understand some simple instructions bad communication i was with talk talk many years now last time my contract renewal i called them several times after i talked to a machine someone answered the phone and i told them its my renewal and im looking for a good deal they didnt bother to listen they just gave me a regular deal which is lot more than im currently paying basically they told me taken it or leave it i didnt like the attitude of this female advisor and she got this accent very difficult to understand i said ill call later i called two more times but all occasions i got someone very rude ignorant with very heavy accent i got really frustrated and i asked them to terminate my contract at the end of the month and stared to check other providers after day or two gentleman from talk talk called and asked would i change my mind if he offer this deal and it was a good one and i agreed i think the biggest problem talk talk have is customer service i dont mind what country they answer the phones from but they need serious training of customer service respect accents etc,Bad
4639,the wifi was never as fast as it was advertised too much lag bad service at least im not going to have a new contract with vodafone never guys just go for if you are in berlin all of my friends never had a problem with tmobile,Bad
4640,shame on took over hours of mind numbing customer service including a call back from a manager for them to agree that they owed me their ceo alleges tomake life as easy as possible for you during the believe a word of it,Bad
4641,talktalk have charged me p for a contract break because i overlapped my new service provider with the end of their service to avoid loss of internet days technically i have been paying for two services as you pay in advance they said i would have avoided this if the start date for the new had been after the old end date also said if i paid this amount late i would incur a late payment charge why are they allowed to behave so appallingly,Bad
4642,if i could i would give stars so my contract finished i was also moving to a different house i called costumer service to tell them that i am moving the costumer service lady was actually very nice gave me a new contract for double speed as i had previously for only which i agreed for no extra cost of the moving as my contract finished anyway days later got my firs bill from so i called them costumer service told me they can do nothing only move my speed back to original charge they also said there will be no extra charges for package change so my next bill came guess what pounds for house moving package change at the same time my phone bill came got a nice pounds bill because of the long waiting but i just paid it because i didnt want to call again get a hour waiting no resolutions so days after i paid my bill guess what just got a text message we are sorry to hear you leaving us to clear your outstanding balance discuss your payment options please call us so i did because i have no idea what they are talking about guess what no any resolutions again just saying that they did not send messages this must be spam from the number i always got the messages from virgin i am at the point of i dont know if i should cry of laugh for sure last year with virgin media completely useless company,Bad
4643,when i tried to let you know my phone didnt work no one wanted to was just passed around different people and not one of them had a bloody clue,Bad
4644,dire customer service no doubt suffering more so due to outsourcing to overseas the service centre didnt read my chat at all and kept referring to a scripted response seem to be making all the right noises with a decent support structure to rely on,Bad

4647,for the second time i have had to contact o about affecting my credit score with erroneous information they resolved that last year but it has arisen again i contacted them about this and spent mins with customer service hah who then passed me to the retention team mins who then passed me to the payments team on hold then for a further mins and then cut off i am now starting a claim about their service and incorrect information to my credit score i use online a government supported system that is simple and easy to use if nothing else they will have to provide a written response that should be challenging,Bad

4655,after moving abroad and requesting for my phone to be unlocked so i can use another sim i found myself waiting weeks with no response from orange i called the customer service team where i was told my phone had been unlocked i then realised that this was a lie i called back to inquire why it was not working i got hung up on twice by two different customer service reps after asking to speak to a manager they were also rude on the phone and there were communication difficulties due to the call centre being out of england i decided to leave the issue for a few more days to allow time for the problem to be solved after calling back two days later i was spoken to very rudely by yet another member of the customer service team i asked to speak to a manager and was told none were available but one would call me back within the hour of course hours later i had received no such call after calling back and another tedious phone call later i was promised to have my phone unlocked within hours it has now been hours and i have not heard a thing from them i have never received such appalling customer service as i have each time i have attempted to contact orange about the issue with my phone on top of all this i am expected to pay a fee for the unlocking of my phone whilst being treated in this horrendous way once i return to england i will be changing my phone contract to a different service provider and will never use orange againi recommend to anybody who is thinking of using orange to use any other mobile phone carrier,Bad

4661,avoid at all costs they are pleasant and helpful whilst wanting your business but dire once they have you or you are wanting to leave no one at the company seems to pass on information or add it to your account on attempting to leave a contract due to and having to leave premises we were told by talk talk that we could we assured them we had someone to renew the contract in the same premises to which we were assured wed receive no penalty we did everything they said we had to do and then they told us we had breached contract eight months later and still in dispute the bill just grew and grew,Bad
4662,oh dear when will i learn to read the trust pilot reviews before i buy i signed up to vodafone broadband services in april they assured me that it would transfer on th may after hours on the phone to them and i must say that their call agent are very polite i am now told that it will be th may i have no idea whats happening and if i will get cut off from my old provider and at no time has vodafone communicated any of this to me beyond disappointed and if you do reply to this please note that i am not on facebook or twitter so please provide a phone number or send me an email,Bad
4663,absolutely awful company to deal with customer service will tell you endless lies to get you to sign a contract then not deliver on any of the promises they made they ignore complaints sent through to them and lie over the phone i honestly regret the day i joined with them i have never dealt with a worse company in any field,Bad

4666,dont get the gee home hub for mobile broadband in my house i get excellent g internet connection on my phone and the gee broadband hub supposedly runs on the same signal but is beyond useless it promises hd streaming devices mbps average speeds etc yet my hub gets mbps when i regularly speed test it can never stream in hd regularly drops out completely and cant even stay connected to a ring doorbell my entire living is earned online and this makes it a daily on the most expensive tariff they offer for it and they expect me to keep paying this for months when the service does not work at all the customer service are useless too and refuse to let you exchange or help in any way even though the product doesnt work and hasnt worked since i got it ive been a customer for years as well with tons of loyalty discounts on my account but they dont care the gee home hub will cost me over these months but they will lose thousands of from me as a customer over my lifetime now never coming back,Bad
4667,when you can actually get through to an operator you cant understand them you have to ask them again and again you get passed around from pillar to post in the mean time spending at least an hour of your life you wont get back being put through to various departments and asked to go in store and then being told you were mis informed what a joke take my advice and go through or some other phone company provider stay well clear of vodafone,Bad
4668,so hard to get through to actually talk to someone about issues services are great but trying to sort issues is just too hard,Bad
4669,i had a scheduled appointment for an engineer to install broadband today i waited in all morning and nobody showed up no update email phone call nothing i then couldnt talk to anybody on the phone because whilst im a customer i dont have a landline number with them so am not entitled to a phone call with a real person i have waited weeks for the installation and have now been told i must wait a further week for an update on when the next appointment will be scheduled all this time wasted i could have gone with a different provider who communicates with their customers far better a frustrating start to say the least,Bad
4670,just moved to another provider finally given up with bt with whom i have tried to be patient for some four weeks ago we started having real trouble with broadband we live in a coastal village in lincolnshire and it has been tolerable for some time suddenly in our area there have been countless problems we cant get fibre as this has been so far to towns and cities that said for the eight years we have been here we have managed to get by my previous bt problem was with their accounts and the fact that they made one payment agreement with me but kept taking about twice as much from my account sorted that but now i have been spending hours of my unpaid time i am a professional writer for for numerous regional national and international publications trying to see what is wrong now with our telephone it went wrong a week ago callers are told that we are speaking on the line we were not various calls to by resulted in promises that were not kept attempts at getting us to spend more with them and so still off broadband goes missing several times a day so had enough and wasted more time trying to find someone else who might make sense not easy settled for ee which probably means that ultimately i am still paying seems to have an illegal monopoly on the national telephone system does anyone care maybe bt is the bbc in disguise arrogant uncaring and useless,Bad
4671,i was being charged for an out of contract fone for months before i seen a bank statement i did no even have the fone all this time being charged continuously for a service i was not receiving,Bad
4672,extremely difficult to get hold of anyone to help with issues limited opening times for support complaints never dealt with in good time and nothing comes of them even when issue lies with virgin media poor coverage throughout house takes days of no internet in a time when working from home is the norm to get engineer out no issue was not locally related i have had or new routers in a year and a problem was i had no wifi and internet signal poor so i couldnt access the web page for help,Bad
4673,so they messed with cloud line installation no phone or internet from august hundreds calls and arguing nothing phone number stuck some where so i even cannot transfer to another well done today get bill double in price what i normally paying,Bad
4674,set up broadband today i get an email saying theres been an issue you need to re order ok so i tryed to re order sounds simple not was passed to or diffrent agents none of who knew what they were on about anyway if u have an hour and half of your time spear then yes sign up if not dont very very shocking customer services,Bad
4675,called up to change address for broadband for a future date as was between properties requested to keep access at current address until move out date advisor made an error and disconnected the broadband today then was told there was nothing they could do to resolve it customer service was appalling nobody seemed willing to help would not take out broadband with talktalk again,Bad
4676,rude unhelpful never again,Bad
4677,what a joke of a company been trying to port number over for days still they havent managed to do a simple thing call customer service everyday get told same thing everytime it been escalated,Bad
4678,ongoing issues with virgin media for some time now we are supposed to be getting a speed of mbps however currently downloading at mbps which is not unusual for virgin have called so many times ive lost count only to have to deal with someone totally of helping we must have heard every excuse by now including the stock try resetting your router over and over again we have had a new router sent only for it to be unable to even make a connection we have had to buy our own extender as the router supplied by virgin media was incapable of creating a wifi signal outside of one room only even the wiring connecting the house to the point in the road is poorly installed with the cable just sat in green lying along the top of the ground through the now and again we get a speed between and mbps but it always reverts back to a crawling pace againi thoroughly advise avoiding virgin media at all costs pay more for another provider if you need to even go for a slower speed when youre not sat around at almost midnight as i am now waiting for a download at mbps that informs you it will be running for a further hours youll know youve made the right decision,Bad
4679,worst company am disabled and was struggling to pay my bill and couldnt pay the full end contract amount i wanted to decrease my plan and hope fully send back iwatch and iphone for an android that i could use with my disability i was transferred to numerous departments in two different calls that lasted an hour and a half with absolutely no help will go elsewhere,Bad
4680,vodafone think its fair to increase their monthly phone plans by for inflation plus a further to support the expansion of their network why should customers pay more to expand their business in the middle of a cost of living called to ask if my plan could be changed to avoid this costly increase they refused and offered no assistance other than an added repayment rules state that telecoms providers must offer their customers the right to exit their contract penalty free if they surprise them with unexpected price rises but because these prices rises are part of consumer contracts they dont qualify under these offer no help to existing customers during this cost of living mobile is the way forward without any mid contract price increase,Bad
4681,just had my letter from this trash company about price increase said i wont be paying it i pay odd pound a month thats with the sports channel and they have the cheek to want another a for their reply,Bad
4682,waiting in a phone queue right now months ago they upped my bill considerably i have been trying to contact them for ages about this with no success and no reply to formal to have to cancel my contract by just canceling the direct debit,Bad
4683,totally let complete lack of any service from have been with since perhaps even earlier i doubt i will continue to stay their only decent point is the very low prices for my needs as a customer since later october the coverage became patchy then abruptly i was not able to make outgoing calls i went into a store and was told to call customer services like it turns out the fault is being caused by the rollout of g and my sim card being very old and unable to support it after many calls back and forth from a friends phone they agreed to send a new sim card no apology no mention of compensation just awful care from a leviathan that clearly is not interested,Bad
4684,avoid can confirm that all the shocking reviews are true ordered fibre back in november and today they cancelled the order was promised compensation at per day for each day it wasnt activated now been told no compensation unless i reorder but at lower guaranteed speeds than my original order,Bad
4685,todays scene in vodafone turkey disgrace despite my inconclusive connection process and my complaints for days i am calling the relevant hotline to cancel my application and now it has been hour and minutes since i connected line is this line of course you will say why did you wait so long vodafone who does not tell the truth says to you dont wait if you want lets get back to you by pressing of course we tried this way many times but it does not return so i wanted to wait no matter what because i contacted without canceling my application to this company whose business ethics fell below i cant process its been hour and minutes now its still the second vodafone regret lets stay away,Bad
4686,moved house a month ago and i still dont have my services up and running but i have just received a bill for more than double my current tariff i have spent hours on the phone waiting minutes to be connected almost every time i have been told that the reason i havent had an engineer out is because the government has stopped them then i see a virgin engineer in my neighbourhood the same day who says that is not true i am still waiting for my services to be set up an engineer to come and my complaint to be replied believe things could have gone so wrong awful customer service and still not resolved,Bad
4687,i have had two emails asking me to rate you but youve done nothing i did all the work online days ago im still waiting for my delivery of a router losing patience now,Bad
4688,broadband from virgin is terrible we have had poor slow service for months with and most days evenings you cannot get through to customer services probably due to the many complaints and engineers are slow to respond and repair we only stayed with this awful company for promised fast speeds for gaming and home working schooling prices are way too high and sky are looking more attractive your socks up virgin you used to be a good company in the branson days,Bad
4689,the overall platform is good tv is reliable but subscriptions are expensive usually find a good deal broadband can be temperamental and only usually down for a couple of hoursthe customer service is awful unprofessional and cannot keep any promise at all i have contacted them times in months to correct my bills escalated to a manager twice every time i am told they will investigate and call me back in hours hours or within the week they have never called me back i am still overpaying,Bad
4690,i pay a lot and it doesnt work well it always disconnects,Bad
4691,dont touch this mobile the customer service is the worst ive ever hadi lost my sim card and just want to get a replacement simple right they have to make it complicated by asking me to order a new one and later put my number back to the new i dont bother because i purely use that card for data dont care about the number when i chat with online agent whoever see me asking to block the lost sim but not giving them business will then disappear and showing connection by the way they use o network which is another let down load nothing even with full bar away from them,Bad
4692,silence from talktalk despite chat being started nothing surprising there customer service is dreadful,Bad
4693,i thought they had improved as a company what a load of crap their tv is not user friendly and very hard to use plus you cant get to talk to anyone i cancel direct debit disconnected everything go back to preview and ordered myself a stay away at all cost,Bad
4694,despite the fact i mentioned several times that on my sim only mobile phone bill it stated i could have a free upgrade and even showed the assistant it when all was done they never mentioned that i would be charged as it was a new contract,Bad
4695,i was told i was receiving the same package as previous then a few weeks later i got an email to say that my virgin mobile sim was being happy with that,Bad
4696,if i could give it a zero star i would absolutely rubbish theres no customer service at all they reckon they value their customers they certainly dont i would not recommend at all worst company going ill be changing providers for sure,Bad
4697,you can join them anytime you want but they made it impossible to called to let them know that i was leaving however they completely ignored what i was saying they just passed me to a different department where they made me unwanted offers to stay although i have repeated several times i just wanted to leave i got tired of their patronising and i put the phone down after minutes and i tried their whatsapp chat again the same procedure me asking to leave they ignoring me and giving me different tried a couple of weeks later this time giving them the date i wanted my services disconnected although they told me they told me they understood i wanted to leave they didnt process my request they sent me a message two hours later with another unwanted offer as i told them i wasnt interested i just ignored their message so according to them i became unresponsive so they didnt process my request to i finally managed to speak to someone who would listen to me i was told that i needed to pay the next month as i hadnt given them weeks notice they completely ignored all my previous messages they also told me that for some reason its their policy to charge an extra month after disconnecting my course i refuse to pay for services not provided three weeks later they passed my account to a debt collector who has contacted me whith a series of lies and i have now confirmation from the regulatory agency that virgin media has broken their own terms and conditions by passing my details to a collection agency while my complaint was being investigated they also put an incorrect default notice on my credit report i assume thats their revenge for raising a complaint against them,Bad
4698,terrible service upgraded from to g internet it has gone worse never seen speeds above just need to find the time and patience to fight for a reimbursement quick to disconnect service but never to fix something thats is broken,Bad
4699,one of the worse web sites i have ever used having to keep in to look at different subjects,Bad
4700,more of a question than a review as trying to speak to a person is virtually impossible when are you coming back to fill in the hole in our back garden and take away your equipment its been nearly months now i didnt pay my last bill hoping youd contact me that didnt work just got an email threatening debt collectors luckily i dont give a fart about my credit rating so good luck with that anyway just in case someone from bt reads this in their lunch hour or stumbles across it by accident its good to talk i wont be holding my breath,Bad
4701,absolutely horrible company christine from complain department should never been allowed to deal with customers for years theyve been calling me and asking whether i want to update my contact then one day theyve sent sneaky email to inform tha contact expired they then increased my fees by without ringing me as theyve been doing this over the past years i fought hard trying to get extra charges back but they believe that they did nothing wrong avoid this at any cost,Bad
4702,im not sure of his position but the manager at the front of the store dan according to his badge was very unhelpful and kept telling me to call up customer services on the phone even though i had told him several times that i had tried this and had no success cant wait to leave vodafone,Bad
4703,i would rate stars if i could since joining the internet has been intermittent but in the last days it has been especially bad have called times in a week each time being told a different reason for issues and to monitor for hrs finally spoke to a manager only to somehow fail security and now have to wait days for letter in the post appalling customer service and poor internet,Bad
4704,they dont deal with complaints i have paid lines rentals for a year in advance they are still also charging me monthly rentals best to avoid this micky mouse outfit,Bad
4705,generally very bad company very poor customer service impossible to reach would not to prove my point that they are really bad at communicating as you can see below virgin responded to my feedback many months ive switched to another provider and in the process virgin kept spamming me with good deals and what not while being unable to reach just a very annoying and disappointing company,Bad

4778,moving from i was expecting o to be a little slower but they are simply unacceptable i mainly want to use my data to stream you tube and music when on the move not talking k video but i regularly get awful buffering and time out errors on the most basic apps if you looking at their coverage and think it looks fine for your area think again its the bandwidth thats the issue their connection ratio is so appalling that i cannot use my phone in manchester city centre save yourself years of misery and pay a little more for a better supplier,Bad

4782,worse internet provider ever rude customer care team that dont seem to understand or speak proper english and follow the same script for every after finishing the script with a customer and find that the customer is still not happy they revert back to beginning of the script and have you repeat your self several times with out even considering what you are actual saying having spent over for a service that doesnt work properly i am now having to file a small claims summon to retrieve the money back i advise anyone who has been provided a bad service by talktalk to do the same according to ofcom they are worst isp so if you are thinking of signing up i strongly advice you not to to get your money back if you are experiencing problems with their service you should apply through the small claims court and should cite the supply of goods and services act or whichever act is relevant to your case you will more likely then not got your money back doing it online costs dont let them steal your money and think they can get away with it you dont even have to make a complaint to them you go directly through the courts and its all done online,Bad
4783,awful deceitful sales contract with virgin media was coming to an end and at months i had called to see what an early cancellation fee would be as it was too high i decided to wait until the end of the contract whilst on the phone the indian advisor said he will throw in sky cinema complimentary for months a month later the mb broadband was running slow so again i called and they said we can enjoy mb for no additional cost for the last month as i havent noticed an increase in broadband speed i have called virgin media to ask for a lower rate or cancel it too my suprise i am on a triple contract that does not end until this time next year when i was told i was getting free sky cinema i was actually being added into a new contract for a year extending my current contract the same with the mb contract they charged me extra they said they have sent me contracts in the post which have ended up amongst the advertisement pile as i wasnt expecting to be getting new contracts i have had to agree in order to cancel these three contracts to set up a fourth contract from today which is mb again and is more expensive than what they are advertising on there site they are an utter scandal of a company literally make me sick i wish there were tougher laws on contracts i did an internet speed test and im receiving mb out of mb broadband,Bad
4784,i would avoid using talktalk i am a brand new full fibre customer since jan who was promised upwards of mbps which was achieved the first day i switched so is since then i have been unable to work from home mornings and not had internet at least evenings in a matter of weeks when i am lucky enough to actually get internet is has been as low as then have the pleasure of having to spend well over an hour every time i call and this is only because i have now worked out what i have to do to be given the privilege of getting through to a human with a technical support team whos skills dont go any further than the script they are reading from you get asked the same questions multiple times that you have already answered because of their script and their lack of training knowledge and ability to understand the issues and what is being explained when i have asked to speak to a manager i get told i have to go through these checks again first and give yet another hour of my time to get absolutely nowhere disgraceful doesnt even cover it,Bad
4785,shocking customer service no one seems to know what they are doing when you phone up i set up a direct debit when i took out my phone contract but still had to pay over the phone if it wasnt for my daughter sorting it out for mei would still be paying over the phone even thou i had set up a direct debit and as for the broadband its pretty shocking for going down,Bad
4786,really unhappy following the installation of my router no notice given despite being advised that i would get a call minutes before guy disappeared after installation despite telling me he would be in tidy up and take photos router was installed under my bed and is so hot to touch that i turned it off,Bad
4787,been with talk talk for years to full fibre and since april my landline as been barred all they say is i gone over my but if landline doesnt work then how can i,Bad
4788,initial contact seemed very genuine and services promised sounded good in reality the audio and visual on the tv is out of sync the broadband drops out daily and the speed is nowhere near that promised the person who said they would be available to resolve any issues suddenly stops answering their phone not sure how i am going to cope with this rubbish for months but as soon as i can i am getting shut of virgin never had these problems with sky and talktalk reply to the below comment i love how they provide ways of getting in touch and then when you try its probably easier to have a chat with the tooth fairy why cant virgin just ensure that things work properly in the first place as in a lot of cases the customer service is none existent beyond a customary generic reply to a complaint on trust pilot,Bad
4789,no service for the th day in a row with virgin media only updating the status and promising a fix that never comes simply worst media company ever,Bad
4790,ive been a customer for virgin media nearly years terrible communication from customer service had engineer to replace broadband times now but the problem still exists found out i was sharing the same cable as the neighbours downstairs which im still very suspicious about cant get internet in every room and when i do the internet is very poor i live in a one bedroom flat as soon as my contract is finished im changing provider not a happy customer and definitely dont recommend virgin media,Bad
4791,they are a monopoly is why the do what ever they want and are the worse service company in the world,Bad

4794,virgin media is think richard pickle has called his service for the level of i quote from the dictionary lack of experience in a service that is naive or inexperienced in a particular context,Bad
4795,i have been a virgin residential company over years and never a complaint the business is a different matter they over sold me what i needed which costs me more than it should have done and they are in breach of contract by not supplying what i signed up for customer service is useless and often rude its hard to find many reviews with good things to say about them that should worry them but it doesnt big companies can be taken down by customer dissatisfaction virgin is no exception there business page is still offering to supply what they cant and so they are still products and signing people up under false pretenses and yes virgin do contact me and ill show you where and how i was signed up under similar false promises and signed up fo things you cannot supply your customer service has no idea of the technical side so they are what is impossible to supply breach of contract i believe so,Bad
4796,i only wish there was a zero star yet again fault with line and broadband bt says diagnose fault diagnostics not working and after three attempts gave up called customer service told fault in my area bet they blame it on the time this year st engineer who came out said you need a new hub waited a week a new hub and a nd engineer came and said you dont need a new hub absolute rubbish,Bad

4798,my year uncle was admitted to hospital in wales this week they are in lockdown and no visitors no phone i have been a vodafone customer for over years and in englands lockdown i thought the easy solution was to get a phone sent to him so i a ordered a payg along with the airtime bundle and well done it arrived overnight so far so so good but it was shipped without a sim even though they gave me the new number call me stupid but when l phone to find what is going on l get told they ship without a l phone up l get held on the line for ages by an obsequious individual who seemed more worried about his rating than a year stuck in lockdown without the means to contact his friends and family not good he may be stuck without contact for days before you sort this is an update posted after the vodafone response below after being cut off after minutes with vodafone and then making several more phone calls i find out they can only post a sim funny they can send a phone by dpd so monday is the earliest it could be sent and no promise it will be there by tuesday i get an email sent saturday night which i see on sunday and they are posting it to the wrong ward with no name on the postage despite the customer service person a hint of oxymoron there reading back to me the the correct name and the correct ward it has to go yesterday i phone customer service again and they say they will correct the address and send another email to confirm as of monday no email but not before the service agent tried to change my account detail to the hospital in will not be off by talking to your social media department it they care to listen to the recordings then post they have done so they can then phone me until then i want it to be clear to others who try to get vodafone to do a simple thing and help an elderly man in isolation to go to another phone supplier who is less interested in their net promoter score enough said,Bad
4799,the deals are cheap but i only got at most g anywhere so internet is always slow my direct debit was set up incorrectly i wasnt made aware so my bill went unpaid and then they cut off my service without me actually knowing why wouldnt usually leave reviews like this but over all just a terrible phone service even leaving was extremely difficult,Bad
4800,wow what an awful company i switched over from sky broadband last may as the current infrastructure only offered me up to mbps in reality it was only mbps bt had a fibre backbone so could offer much higher speeds i clocked it at around mbps once it was installed after missed appointments and days off work on my part i finally had it installed as a goodwill gesture for wasting my time the guy on the phone offered me my first months free which i agreed was acceptable after months i got a huge bill for around so i called their ridiculous phone system and on the rd or th try managed to speak to a human being they denied all knowledge of this promise of months free and i urged them to listen back to the phone call as i would like the goodwill gesture that i was offered they said they would listen to the call and call me back within working days days passed no phone call i called again through that phone system and asked why i hadnt received a call no knowledge of the request great apologies blah blah they will call me back within hours no call after a few calls on different days trying to get somewhere i gave up hope very angry at this point then i had a moment of madness and decided to email mr ian livingston he replied back within about mins saying he was very sorry and would pass my details onto a top level customer service manager sounded promising sure enough the next day i had a call from a nice apologetic lady she said she was sorry ive had such a bad start with bt and that she didnt need to listen to the original call she will refund all the charges so far including the late payment fees i refused to pay a penny until it was resolved so as of st october i was about in credit wonderful result alas it has gone downhill from there my standard month bill is infinity line rental i dont have a phone connected to the phone line and bt infinity is unlimited so i know what my bill will be each and every month unfortunately the bt computer system doesnt see it this way i had a letter saying you are using more than you should so we are increasing your monthly payment to to cover this i was furious every month i call them speak to managers other staff explain the whole story time and time again i have been on the phone for hrs more than once and havent got anywhere i was told that would stop taking the every month and reduce it back to what it should be but they still refused to refund the amount i had overpaid up until that point the next month jan they take another i couldnt believe it again in feb they took another they have taken a total of over the last months x instead of x so i figured they owe me they refute this another thing is they generate a quarterly bill which i wasnt told when i entered into a contract i am also on what they call monthly billing as opposed to a standard direct debit all because i wanted the dd to exit my account on a specific date this practice is standard in the utilities industry apparently which is funny because i dont have this problem with my gas and electricity having a monthly plan they tell me that the amount can be adjusted by them each month as they see fit bs all i wanted was a bill each month for my usage whether thats in advance or not i dont really care because i know what that bill will be because i cant go over my allowances due to it being unlimited and not having a phone connected i had my latest call about a week ago and after hrs i asked to speak to the cancellation department after another lengthy hold and explaining the whole story again the adviser said i couldnt cancel as there was an outstanding debt on the account and i need to speak to billing first i was furious an outstanding balance when i am owed over i couldnt believe it again i was put on hold back to billing on hold waiting for a manager explain the whole story yet again either he hangs up or we get cut off speechless so im still at odds as to what to dono matter how many times i speak to them or who i speak to i never seem to get knows how much time and money i have spent calling them from my mobile to add insult to injury sky released their own fibre service about months into my bt contract on another note weeks ago some nice person decided to crash their car into the green bt node at the end of the street severing internet and phone connections to my whole street this is not bts fault i know but it took around weeks to fix with no email or phone call to apologise i called them to ask why i very rarely saw an engineer at the crash site they said they would look into it internet is back now so im expecting a refund for the weeks i had no infinity what do you think my chances are many promises broken many payments taken im sure if this was the other way around i would have someone on my doorstep asking for the money avoid and save yourself the time hassle and stress related to dealing with such an awful company,Bad
4801,as a follow up to my last review complaint raised and escalated on th nov on th and the th nov still no call from complaints manager all departments useless social media useless this company should be avoided like a respect of customers at all,Bad
4802,even though they are powered by ee their data is piped through their own terrible network bought a bundle which only worked for days then stopped cant get online now and there is noone to help the customer service team shouldnt be allowed to be called a customer service team and they and totally them to the ombudsman,Bad

4804,very disappointed with virgins level of service we placed an order for virgin broadband with an activation date of weeks away this was already a long time without internet from moving into the property but this is standard so wasnt a problem i then had to find out for myself by calling for an update that the order hadnt gone ahead because the previous tenants hadnt cancelled their account firstly i dont see how this is our problem but secondly no one bothered to contact us to tell us there was an issue after twice being promised a call back which never happened and after them saying they would see what they could do to meet our original activation date they merely placed a new order with an activation date a further weeks away and essentially denied the original order even existed i told them how unhappy i was with having to wait month for our internet to be activated but they refused to do anything to frustrated and disappointed,Bad
4805,i have been with virgin media for very long time but thought about changing provider frequently as the charges have increased so much when i was working i contacted virgin who offered a discount sometimes and i stayed put as it was easier and i was seduced by the connection speed pitch i now have bt and they are just as good ive now retired and have had time for the long torturous process of changing provider as it is taking weeks to extricate myself from virgin since bt have sorted their bit in the meantime the customer service at virgin has been appalling long winded and i have spoken to a very rude young man who criticised other providers was patronising and took over minutes to finally acknowledge that all i wanted to do was cancel the service i have contacted virgin repeatedly to firstly make my original request to cancel my tv and broadband service then to check that they were actually doing so as id been sent a bill for beyond the end date and then to phone them to ask why hadnt it been done on the agreed date i have asked for confirmation emails of issues raised but none have been sent and i cant access my virgin media online account as my email appears not to be recognised despite virgin media being able to contact me on it i have asked to set up a complaint times and been told a manager would get back to me which they havent the tv connection finally got turned off over a day late whilst i was on a whatsapp call started at no one got back to me until after pm but wifi is still on if i dont get the complaint dealt with by the weeks the relevant ombudsman requires me to wait i will take this further i am advising friends and neighbours who are caught in the virgin trap how to extract themselves but its a big effort to get out and it shouldnt be its been an appalling isnt yet complete weeks on,Bad
4806,stay in to runcorn shopping city store to sort a new phone and contract that my mother had ordered i was spoken to like i was some sort of dirt by the manager who was very clearly his other two staff were also unhelpful and acted as if they were scared of have been a customer with vodafone for years and he said that makes no difference i called customer services at the shop who said they would call me back called again and was promised some one would contact me nothing i called for the third time were i advised i would leave them in april when my contract ends i have since had my pak code and i get a email is there anything we can do to keep your away customer service in store help as i run my own business i always think it takes months to find a customer and seconds to loose one well done vodafone you lost a long serving one,Bad
4807,i just called virgin media to update my package with them the customer service rep told me that if i paid a payment of for an o sim card that i could get gb broadband for extra a asked her several times if this was a payment and she reassured me that it getting off the phone call i got sent an month contract from o to pay a never wanted an o sim card and never agreed to a contract and feel like i have been conned by virgin media into thisi complained to virgin media and the reply was not about what i had queried and not in correct english very of the reply are you for taking time to contact us as per your complaint we understand that you are not happy that the package change i regret the inconvenience caused however after reviewing your account i see that you recently made changes to your package your monthly rate is then i suppose the services a working fine we are looking forward to helping you at the have been a customer for years and this is a terrible way to be treated we have now been left with an mobile account on top of our virgin media account which we do not need and never wanted,Bad
4808,since setting up my asda mobile account online i have not been able to top up using any of my registered cards the problem is because the address on my asda mobile account does not match the address with my bank i am unable to register my address correctly with asda mobile due to the way their system is set up all they need to do is add an address line field as most other websites do on the address information section and that should resolve the have called asda mobile customer service many many times over the past two months and have sent many many direct twitter messages to try and get this issue resolved i have even told them what i think the issue is but all you get from them is weve passed this on every single time and nothing gets done there is absolutely no customer service with asda mobile and i would avoid them at all costs and clearly its not just me as other customers have given them a whopping of bad reviews days later and kate or anyone for that matter has contacted me even after reading my review on here and i replied to her and provided my contact information,Bad
4809,since installation on i had bad at times no wifi i explained my previous provider had been installed in the basement due to engineers coming out surveying the area and saying they will see how it goes if they fit and have to move they will mid installation the gents were called away on anther job and the two new gents installed the rest of the job and walked out the door until th of october i had little to no wifi and no connection at all to my basement where my main computer was housed safely and securely i called to complain and was told wifi is not guaranteed and i am now tied for months and there was nothing i could do about it after many weeks of arguing with many staff i eventually advised i would not pay the bill and i was advised over the phone before signing up that the fibre service would blow my wifi signal through the roof there would be no problem due to me not recalling the persons name i was called a liar i had many chasers emails to sign up for the fibre service and i am not so keen to open these emails so what i did do was go online and find virgin customer services myself and ask how good the wifi would be and was advised the above however because i could not give the name of the person who advised the wifi reception would be trough the roof i was a liar this went on for months on my service was moved from upstairs and nearer the basement and i was able to connect to the wifi but it still goes off completely and the system has constant outages i am a guest house and the damage this has done to business at my busiest time of year was simply first installed i complained and an engineer came out his name was neil he left his mobile number and said to go online order cable rgs and install them all over the house myself after weeks of suffering no signal i eventually called again the following run of events happened i called kas hold for min passed to adam web on hold again passed to hali who said wifi not and the phone was put down i did the same run of events again and advised hali of the call before signing up that my signal would be through the roof she advised this did not happen i got angry and said i am not a liar she advise me to give her the name of the person who advised this as i did not have a note of the name she said it did not happen now the call time had taken min from my mobile i was put on hold i was then advised by hali there was nothing i could do as wifi is not guaranteed and a fiber signal was brought into the house so the service was fulfilled i asked for this to be registered as a complaint she refused many times call time now at min hali advised she would close complaint i said not too i advised i would simply keep calling only when advising this hali advised she would refer this to be looked at and would call me back on but no call back i called chris on at pm hold min passed to kate clegg now pm kate advised my referral by hali was looked at and there was nothing that could be done i was advised the complaint said i was just not happy and i was wifi service i advised kate my complaint was due to engineers coming out and saying they will install upstairs in my front room and if there was a problem getting connected in the basement they could move it i stressed to the engineers on arrival i needed my main computer working in the basement however the initial engineers left way through installation and the new engineers that took over installed and walked out the door after being on the phone hour and min to kate and explained this kate advised she would have manager call me back in hrs i called back on for outcome i got hali again she advised she tried to call me bk on but she could not get me my complaint had been dealt with and there was nothing new to look at i advised her of the nd referral to the manager that was logged by kate on she said she would look into this and call me back no call back on at am i spoke to tj gave him the run of events he advised the ceo team were dealing with this complaint and i will get a call back i called again on hali advised i could be released from contract and waived the charges or have box relocated to the basement where it should have been in the first place if it did not make any difference after relocation i would be stuck with it for the months total amount being and nothing i could do about it i was tied as i would be left with nothing for an even longer period until i got another provider this was my busiest time of year for trading so i had no alternative but to say a relocation i was to wait on an email confirming this to me that day at pm pm on i called as i had not received any email again on am and at then again on and was advised no one knew what the situation was i was put on hold for min and cut off then on i received a call advising the internet would be installed on i received an email confirming this on since being installed i have lost my internet all together many times when i call i am then advised sorry we have just been informed there is an outage in your area i do not know what this means but after my run of events above and speaking from experience if you are considering this state of the art fibre broadband i would avoid at all cost i will be moving when i am free from contract my husband and i also have been a virgin mobile customer for over years and this is now being changed to another provider we have received no apology all this and the monthly money still being taken from our banks nightmare please note this review will be also logged with

4819,wifi intermittent told everything was ok signal is rubbish keeps dropping calls happens all the time,Bad
4820,the service is terrible they cannot help me i have had no connection for weeks what am i supposed to do,Bad
4821,ee continues to charge me for a sim not used for over two years it was just by luck i found out that i have been charged over pm for over two years ee has stolen over from me they dispute that this is not theft if i didnt accidently become aware of this and contacted them they would have continued to charge me forever or until i died what shameless and terrible company,Bad
4822,almost a pure scam indeed their rates are extremely low but this requires incredible and if not you will be spending gbp before realizing that they are robbing you basically the sim works right from the start perfectly but the rate is something like gbp for mb of data super expensive to get their lower rate you have to super quickly shut off data send some weird sms messages to get some strange esoteric goody bag and then turn data back off otherwise your money evaporates in minutes so disappointed it is clear they make their money on first customers who subsidize the low rates of the in crowd,Bad
4823,i have been a talk talk customer for over years and as my current contract was due to end i contacted talk talk to see what was on offer i was treated with for even daring to mention i might leave talk talk and from that point on the talk talk representative did everything they could to make leaving so very difficult i was disgusted at the way i was treated after years and it only confirmed just how unprofessional this talk talk representative was i would not recommend talk talk to anyone and if you use this company we warned you will be used and abused,Bad
4824,rubbish service as usual from bt lost call diversion from a hr service line for weeks support is shocking with frequent calls with technical who dont know the either weeks later we have office phone which does not work and the portal being generally rubbish,Bad
4825,good service but shocking abusive rude retention simple call to tell them i wanted to finish my contract and give days notice as i was at the end of my contract turned into minutes of hell with their retention simple conversation which turned into an argumentative bully tactic from vm was embarrassing from being laughed at by the agent down the phone to being called stupid for leaving is not a great way to keep a customers loyalty of attempts i finally got the mark down that i wanted to cancel good riddance freeview box internet and streaming is all you need,Bad
4826,ive switched to ee several years ago as they had best g coverage in the country now days i can barely get the page to load and its regardless of where i am even when full bars are main issue now however is the fact that over the last two days i was trying to get my apple watch to work with cellular but after two days of literally hours on the phone chat long waiting times and promise it will work within hours im still nowhere to be able to make calls via my watch without the handset being really hope someone from ee will read this as im on the verge of giving up and moving all our contracts across to a different provider really disappointed as it really once was great network,Bad
4827,l really donot care a monkeys cuss about gg or for that matter g all l want is a phone signal is that to much to ask for gods sake,Bad
4828,for the past over a month ive had no signal at home because the mast is entire time ive been unable to make it receive calls or messages i cant speaks to friends or family missed important appointments including from my gp diabetic nurse counsellor and dietician none of whom can get through i cant log into online accounts like ebay paypal and bank as i cannot receive the security codes to log in due to having no signal eventually when they do come through its too late for them to have been of any emailed and made a formal complaint and was told to call instead the absolute ridiculousness of telling someone to phone who has complaint about no i finally got a signal to call they promised a callback or email from supervisor which i never the o status page it said the issue would be fixed may its now a week beyond and still not fixed tesco insisted if i switched network i have to pay penalty and just me to wait wait for what for you to start to give a ive switched anyway and you are welcome to try and chase me for it but under the circumstances i am paying you nothing i never got any compensation for the past month of it not working on either my or my partners accounts eventhough i was promised compensation so clearly this is about greed and just trying to get me to stay with threats of penalty charges well good luck enforcing them when you cant even provide the basic to vodafone good riddance to tesco and their useless customer service,Bad
4829,most recent,Bad
4830,i want to give bt minus minus stars this is the most frustrating abysmal run company i have ever had to use they have continually me off with promises to call back or fix the broadband service which they must of miss sold me as they cant maintain a signal because of network traffic totally fed up to the back teeth with bt would definitely not recommend,Bad
4831,thief is days for change of mind with every mobile phone they dont cancel the contract and push you to use their rubbish costumer service and inconsiderate policy,Bad
4832,i guess you are not aware of the tenants of basic contracts i signed up with talk talk and third party stooges you are behaving like some robot without looking at the root cause of this to grips and sort this debacle,Bad
4833,the single most incompetent customer service ive ever come across ive left vodafone and not a moment too soon for over a year theyve had my address wrong they sent me a letter telling me theyd switch the broadband off at the end of the month at somebody elses address not even mine for over a year ive been chasing customer services to get my address correct and every time they say they have really im with a better supplier now they had everything set up at my house within hours of opening my account vodafone are the biggest joke ive ever come across customer services never know what theyre doing,Bad
4834,ridiculous calling rates to to call home in australia minutes later my chat is cut short thinking there must be some mistake i look up their rates a minute to a landline how can they possibly justify this in when their competitors are offering rates of p a minute for the same service leaving and will not be returning,Bad
4835,placed my st order on aug and got an visit on sep the engineer did turn up but he did nothing but left without a clear explanation after about calls i was told theres some issue with the fibre line connection now it was sep my property developer finally confirmed with that the connection was working and i can speak to bt again guess what my order was cancelled by bt without even telling me on sep i placed the nd order and it looks everything went well this time and the broadband and phone are supposed to be activated by thursday i was being optimistic this morning to be cautious die the previous experience i called bt thats right my broadband got delayed again reason unknown if you got any alternative just avoid bt,Bad
4836,if you can get a really cheap deal and get that deal renewed then virgin might just be worth while otherwise they are customer service should you have the misfortune to need to call them is non existent they dont even respond when you slate them in direct marketing reviews they take for ever to answer the phone and often after an hour of being passed from person to person your problem is still unresolved i only went with them as there is a local agent who gave us his personal number and meant we didnt initially have to deal with the incompetents at virgin media customer service just look at any review site to see how they fare then make your mind upi got a free all inclusive sim in our package im paying extra to go back to three as virgin media changes your dialling and location service settings google it seems to be common promises super fast speeds but fails to deliver tv box compared to sky plus looks and works like something from the s so clunky and unintuitive hard to believe this i what they are still giving people,Bad
4837,poor cant give me the cable i need got for a engineer to move router i get less than mb speed been through complaints that got me know where then u upped ur prices now i pay more for what i dont get and to top it of the call handler today put me on hold for a total of minutes because she wouldnt listen to me when i was explaining the cable i need,Bad
4838,wont recommend them they cancelled my services without emailing or calling me inquire happy after reading all the bad reviews from customers avoid,Bad
4839,dont book if you think about cancelling in day cooling off you can cancel but virtually impossible to do so,Bad
4840,god help you if you ever need to cancel its been ongoing for months and still not getting anywhere absolutely horrific customer service would definitely not recommend,Bad
4841,my housemates and i attempted to by a dsl box in germany and the service from o was completely rubbish they took over a month to deliver the box and then we had to wait another month after that for the phone line to be activated as the title says the service was an absolute travesty and added to that was the fact that when we rang up to complain they ignored what we were saying and then attempted to sell us another item cheeky do not use o for internet,Bad
4842,nothing more to ad cheap broadband crappy connection,Bad
4843,on the th december all over the news and went down for hours no data calls and texts mine was same lost out on ebay items important emails etc got hold of who am paying a month for unlimited data etc even tho they cut u right down on data speed after being on it for a bit i complained about the hours lost on the th dec they never got back to me by email so i got back onto them they said i spoke to my head office and sent u pence compensation thats it what a absolute joke of a company i think its time to get rid was ok wen it first came out but not now avoid at all costs as the price u pay these u can get a fone on contact with handset for same price more better service than p for hours loss of service,Bad
4844,i have been a customer of ee for many years and have had many contracts with them i recently left them for a cheaper sim only deal with another provider it didnt work out and now im trying to return to ee however they have decided im a poor credit risk even though i have a perfect experian credit score i complained about this and was given an email address to use it doesnt work when i told them they keep sending the same email address over and over no attempt to try anything else just the same wrong information again and again terrible,Bad
4845,have been with bt for many years switched to talktalk worst decision shocking service wireless routers absolutely shocking coverage do not use this company thoroughly regret switching happy to pay more for a better service please do not use this company appalling,Bad
4846,awful company i recently missed a payment due to a change of circumstances i tried to contact them to tell them i cannot pay until a specific date but i was just told sorry well have to disconnect your phone cant you pay sooner despite saying i cannot afford to theyve now cut off my phone completely disgusting company not considerate at all especially to the current cost of living crisis they harass you none stop phone calls when you miss a payment not helpful when youre at work funny how when you miss a payment they disconnect you and harass you but when your phone has had poor data connection and phone calls constantly cut out they dont want to know or help you at all,Bad
4847,the worst and most dishonest customer service virgin media repeatedly try to ignore existing contracts fraudulently overcharge and fail to respond to any recently found against them and fined them on my behalf virgin media immediately breached the agreement and ignored the findings of this are currently overcharging me have arbitrarily imposed a new contract against my wishes and refuse to discuss owe me hundreds of pounds and refuse to refund their reply below virgin media were ordered by the adjudicator to pay me hundreds in compensation they continue to try to fight the complaint they still dont reply to any of my emails,Bad
4848,bro your wifi is a joke crashes every hour every hour at like m ex am are you for real sort out cuz i swear ill move to sky that is worse however doesnt crash like yours i swear down its annoying for some reason i loose bloody signal as well my g doesnt work virgin media are just being tight hire people with experience not people that barely know english for real now,Bad
4849,a company that spends more time asking for feedback than my issues inconsistent advise from agents and denial of what they promised over a month of teething problems and no genuine empathy that this is a service i am paying for sorry is the easiest word rectifying issues is the hardest part,Bad
4850,i am with this service and will expect compensation for the distress this has caused my wife and myself,Bad
4851,here is my experience with broadband line supposed to go live on th of february an engineer came on th he set up the line and left i have connect the router by myself and there was no internet i called the customer service they said it will go live at am midnight anyway on the next day there is still no internet on th of february i called the customer service again on my call they have checked my internet and they have told me there is a network problem so they pass this problem to manchester network team and my internet will be fix within hours days on rd of february i have called them because there still no internet and after my hours have passed the customer service team told me again they will make problem as priority and they will send this problem to the network team in manchester and it will take again hours this time customer service promised it will get fixed they told me wait till thursday of february i was still patiently waiting still th of february but they did not fix i called on th of february and believe me the customer service told me again they will forward this problem to their manchester team and they will have contact me by hours today is nd of march but still they did not contact me so i called again to customer service in the morning their customer team feed me lies and tell me network team tried to contact me yesterday funny thing she told again their manchester network team will fix this issue within hours my question is if talktalk deal this way with their first customer i wonder how they deal with the existing customer they have puppet customer service team who speak over the phone and basically useless talktalk is cheap and cheap service you will get,Bad
4852,i was advised that virgin media were the best in the uk for broadband how wrong could i be firstly after apparently the router being delved to a neighbour as requested on my order i spent minutes disturbing my street asking if they had taken a package in no one had i then spent hrs on the phone with a so called advisor who could not understand that i could not be at home to receive the new router as i work after lots of back and forwards and agreeing a date for new delivery and then being told at the end of the call that it was now not available a delivery date was agreed router delivered all fine then it came for me to install nobody told me that i actually need a virgin line and connection box so then called to cancel another minute wait to then be told that i have to call back tomorrow asked for a call back which never happened so i called on the way home from work last night minutes on hold then spoke to someone who didnt understand my name who then finally said give me seconds and i will transfer you to the cancellations team back on hold minutes later still no answer this service has been absolutely abysmal and i just dont know how virgin media can say that they are an excellent broadband supplier with outstanding customer service if you like hanging on hold and not speaking to advisors that speak english and understand what you want feel free to contact them i would never recommend virgin to anyone,Bad
4853,poor company av been waiting over a hour to speak to someone and they put your price plan up without you,Bad
4854,absolutely horrible company christine from complain department should never been allowed to deal with customers for years theyve been calling me and asking whether i want to update my contact then one day theyve sent sneaky email to inform tha contact expired they then increased my fees by without ringing me as theyve been doing this over the past years i fought hard trying to get extra charges back but they believe that they did nothing wrong avoid this at any cost,Bad

4856,i have been a talktalk customer for years ordered a new fibre line in october have had separate installation dates come no engineer turns up no communication from you can get through on chat it takes forever the agents are useless the only communication is automated texts that say they will update in weeks then do not next installation date march th even though they say calendar days for not believe them they have no control on what engineers do and do not have been a total waste of are cheap yes but god help you if you have any kind of,Bad
4857,i wanted to talk to somebody to sort out what should be a simple problem but it is now appears to be a big problem and i may have to change providers to resolve it,Bad
4858,home broadband and their customer service is so poor i feel compelled to write this review swapped to broadband from sky recently activation date th sept router arrived on time activation date came and went no connection spent literally hours contacting customer services to find out what was happening to finally be told there was a all of a sudden a problem on our line the very same line the worked perfectly for sky bt blamed told they were working on it and should be up soon but no firm date finally got connection days later all seemed to be up and running speed up and down certainly not up to full speed yet ad paying for fibre can accept fluctuations and will wait to see how things progress came home today to find no network connection at all tried to contact customer services via live chat impossible tried by phone impossible checked online forums to get the impression that nearly entire network down people all over the country complaining of system outage and impossible to contact for a company if its size and supposed stature in the communication business i find this very very poor indeed sky were poor their broadband was poor at times but im seriously starting to regret the switch one week in,Bad
4859,i need a place to release some of my anger towards this atrocious company so at first i had high hopes for this company as router came fast in post and things looked good however when that activation date came through i had no wifi and after making calls i was promised wifi on many occasions i have had to battle with ai that little tobi bot the i could not get through to a real person for ages and when i did it was through text which just isnt helpful weeks ive been trying to get my wifi sorted when did get through to real people they were lovely but had not got a clue what they were doing either i had video chats where this lady kept having to put me on hold as she had no idea where the wire should go there was also this of a guy online who kept using big wifi words and as im not a technology wizard he made no sense to me and continued to tell me to unscrew st from the wall like im some engineer now got wifi working and got charged even though ive had it working one day when it should be a month im telling you people vodafone take up your time and the customer service system is very very very bad and thats only cuz its fast wifi everything else bout this company is i hope whoever made that little tobi bot has a bad day today,Bad
4860,whats happened the phone selection use to be really good but apparently its like a beta selection has popped up seriously talk about ripping customers of with crappy phones,Bad
4861,after being with tmobile since they were known as my problems began once they merged with orange and became ee i enquired about a portable mobile device and was sent one on trial the data allowance was rubbish so i called to cancel and they sent a package to return the device after calling several times i never received the package and instead got bombarded with calls asking if i wanted home broadband instead i declined after reading the dreadful reviews despite them offering to waive the extortionate set up fees and charge for the router i went with free service i since moved house a yr later i was eligible for my phone upgrade chose a handset and accessories at the til it wouldnt go through because i had an outstanding account of i was on the phone til past store closing to find it was the mobile device i was charged for plus a yrs contact they had passed this to debt management agency and said i had to resolve with them i called to be told they closed it back in april ee swore blind it was with the debt management and couldnt do anything about it basically telling me i would get my upgrade unless i paid for a service i never used eventually they found it was back with them an hr later but im now forced to pay livid doesnt cut it,Bad
4862,worst customer service ever seriously stay away,Bad
4863,dont do it to yourself so we ordered talk talk full fibre mb was told we would have to cancel our current provider to get their services which we did with immediate effect i thought we can wait a feel without lost our broadband service with zen internet using the city fibre line got an email from talk talk saying all was processed and city fibre would give me an installation date bare in mind zen was a month and talk talk offered for the same package week passed nothing off city fibre and no internet still at home then gets a text message saying they cannot provide full fibre to my address what a waste of my time contacted zen again and paid a month for mb they had me reconnected in two days talk this morning decided to give me a bill for for something they didnt give me i dont even have internet with this company the bill was laughable and this is now something i have to sort out go to zen internet miles better service and they use uk call centres might be abit more expensive but we all know the term you get what you pay for,Bad
4864,was sent letter saying needed to up grade system fitted new modem and router router needed app to work didnt have smart phone so router wouldnt work was sent another router this didnt work was told possible modem fault had new one fitted still didnt work was sent another router got it all set up when modem fell of wall pulling out fibre wire reported it had no reply for days so had enough of being passed for to talk talk saying it was each others fault so i had no internet from may june cancelled account gone with another company had internet up and running in hours,Bad
4865,after being a virgin customer for years on a high subscription i was the sky film package by a call centre agent when i complain little was done about it seems to be bau practice i decided to terminate my account and the agent i spoke to agreed to nullify my last bill i then received demands from virgin for i tried to complain about this and asked them to listen to what the agent had agreed all calls recorded they agreed to do so i started to receive two sets of letters one a demands and one stating they where still investigating the case and would i like a transcription of the call i said yes and the next letter i had was from a debt collection agency which i immediately paid and im still waiting for transcription of the call and dealing with the impact on my credit score virgin is great when you have no problems but when you do the customer care team dont and they dont communicate with their finance team,Bad
4866,this company is a fraud years of agony and countless hours with technical support dont get involved with talktalk they give you faulty devices theyre internet is dropping out every minute theyre technical service is a mess and resolves nothing they leave you with no connection and lie about theyre speeds they take money for faulty services and keep you in a contract that is not possible to get out of unless you pay them more for a non working service i dont understand how they arent out if business and closed down,Bad
4867,the worst customer service of any company i have ever experienced the people i have spoken to over many months of trying to resolve an ongoing issue have generally been rude unhelpful and dishonest in their solutions and responses to the companies official wait to leave virgin media and would recommend anyone to avoid them at all costs,Bad
4868,three years ago my boyfriend talked me into joining ee he had been an orange customer since the days of communication and rated them very highly i spoke to a sales guy i asked for the same plan as my boyfriend but was told that his plan was out of date but the guy could actually do me a better deal he talked me through it all and it sounded perfect so i went for it everything was ok for a few months the bills were a bit higher than i had expected but not enough to warrant me to take any real notice then while on holiday i rang the automated service to pay my bill the operator said my bill was my bill should have been this came as a shock but i just presumed there had been a mistake i called the ee team and explained i was on holiday and that the bill must be wrong and i would sort it out when i got home if they would please just not put me on incoming only as im sure theres been a mistake but as im on holiday i would look at it when i got back if they would be so kind as to post me a bill for when i got back i was reassured that this was fine and would not be put on incoming only the following day i was put on incoming only and when i returned home there wasnt a bill eventually i got my bill and found that the bill was correct i had been put on a plan without any landline minutes at all included when i was told landline calls were included as a result i had made several lengthy phone calls that i hadnt even thought about thinking the inclusive minutes would cover them i explained what had happened to the ee team but was told i needed to pay the and then they would look into my case apparently the sales guy had disappeared and they didnt know who i was talking about when i gave his name and the area he was calling from i made two formal complaints about being the contract and being left without the use of a phone while on holiday after being promised it would be put on my file to leave any action until i return from holiday as it was thought to be a mistake i received no reply from my complaints just harassment for their money i then told them that i would pay the bill as soon as i received a response regarding my complaints with this they cancelled my contract and asked for to cover the remaining contract and outstanding bill i continued to battle with the company and even wrote to the ceos office thinking they cant ignore my letters complaints then still no response after three years just lots of defaults on my credit file and still calls and letters demanding the with no interest at all in the fact that i wouldnt have even taken the contract in the first place if i wasnt told the contract was something it wasnt my boyfriend i both moved to three although their signal isnt great they do have some interest in customer services and are accountable for their actions,Bad
4869,worst customer service used to be a loyal customer of ee but i went to store and the advisor was very rude with me i also complained about the signal because in my area i have very bad service full signal and i cant use my data and im not able to make or receive calls i pay per month so i think i deserve a explanation,Bad
4870,inadequate internet wifi support blamed my problems on my up market extensive extender system when it turns out their was defective they never followed up after sending me new box and to compound their indifference they sent me two zen have asked for more info after sending patronising we do try see if they get back in touch now i am not prepared to waste endless hours waiting on phone lines to be put through,Bad
4871,having virgin media is just a gamble if it works with no issues then great if you have any sort of technical issues it will take a huge amount of time and effort to get resolved struggling to get through to humans for an actual example i was having really intermittent internet issues i call up and enter my postcode on the phone and the system advises there are problems in my area and to press to receive more info i press and i receive a text with a link the link goes back to their main site where you enter your postcode to check for faults i enter my postcode and it tells me my internet is currently running with no issues complete waste of time and no option to speak to anyone,Bad
4872,unfortunately the telephone and chat services are hopeless and the situation is just giving notorious terrible customer service record an excuse not to get its act together currently have properties supplied by them and only wanted to get a third property up and running with them any decent business would jump at the chance but not this has fortunately since been one of sun called alisha based in leicester its like winning the lottery to speak with this lady after all the numerous previous individuals in numerous departments perhaps talktalk need to use this lady amongst the others based wherever they are to give them something to aspire too,Bad
4873,its shocking how bad it is for months ive been trying to sort out some problems with our phone service and i have spoken to bt every day hour minimum for months and they cant resolve it,Bad
4874,second poor review after finally getting contact with customer services and being offered a less good deal from the initial deal that i signed up for i have once again been cut off again for whatever reason the payment was not taken from my account and stopped working so first thing this morning called customer services paid my expecting i was paying the for the bundle i had was offered after last time i was cut off with the customer service representative reassuring me no problem no problem no problem only to find by tonight i have no credit left so my five pounds must have been for a pay as you go and that five pounds disappeared within hours of me calling them why am i not on the bundle that i originally had a contract for i am totally bemused frustrated and angry about the service i have had from more time wasted tomorrow morning to try and sort this out,Bad
4875,rubbish i have bought a new mobile received a sim from talktalk prompt the performance to get it activated is get my grandson to do it for me i pay my phone bills by direct debit they dont recognise my email address when i try my account say my password is not recognised you will recognise it when i send this email,Bad
4876,ive been with ee for years ive even got mobile phone contracts ive taken out a landline with broadband with this company and it as been really good up till now ever since this coronavirus as kicked off the engineers are not allowed into my house to see whether it is a fault or not in side my hse thats the excuse they are telling me well i know thats the problem is not coming from the inside its coming from the outside as ive never experienced this before they keep mugging me off every time i call its becoming very frustrating and wasting my time talking to them all i see on my router internet light red most of the time and its getting worse and worse i wouldnt recommend to anyone to take out a landline with this company since the coronavirus has been one of the worst companies ever they keep changing their contracts i took out a a month mobile phone contract with unlimited talk time unlimited texts and gigabytes of data months later they changed it to gigabytes you need to be really careful with this company as they keep changing it contracts very naughty stronger dont recommend any mobile phone contracts with this company go elsewhere thats what i will be doing,Bad
4877,i have been a customer and worked with vodafone in a professional capacity i cannot go into the professional experience we had with them but felt compelled to say something however vague it may come across the treatment of people they were trusted with is unforgivable lies negligence complete lack of any capability or concern time buying tactics and then avoidance of their responsibilities i have never experienced anything like it after years of working with many companies big and small across the globe i hope this company gets what they deserve after they have made many people live a misery real lives affected in ways that cannot be undone and that no one agreed to not one person in the company gave a concern i cannot divulge fully but i speak only the truth the worst company i have ever come across,Bad
4878,for months they said there was nothing wrong with my broadband when i made a complaint they still blamed wifi which i wasnt even using sent an engineer around in a marked van to replace the cable but still said no issue and then magically it was fixed customer experience is something they dont care about,Bad
4879,worst customer service i have ever had to deal with my year old mother has been left without a phone and no one has a clue still without a phone now plus her home start bracelet not working as this is linked to the phone lets hope she does not have a fall if i could give a minus you would get one they are a liability,Bad
4880,can get any sence out of anybody after calls about talktalk mobile terrible service will be looking to change my home number and broadband,Bad
4881,havent dealt with the company after the sham they were before and closed all my accounts have nothing to do with company and today have received a letter through for a bill when called woman wasnt even sure what it was for now ive been on hold for minutes trying to get through for the phone to be cut off,Bad
4882,the worst customer service ever i have been receiving letters from virgin for the latest bill when i have already cancelled and paid the final settlement when i call the customer service team i either get passed on to another advisor or cut off i have called times today and the result of all calls was to be cut off at the end worst service ever do not use virgin pay a little more but atleast recieve a excellent service contracts and both same results over charging customers,Bad
4883,avoid taking pay monthly mobile contract with tesco i took contract with tesco and had direct debit and i missed payment tesco closed my account demanded for bridge of contract they took the debt to debt collection and i agreed to pay a month months later and they are demanding full amount of,Bad
4884,far to expensive dont offer loyal customers a discount ever,Bad
4885,i found setting up my pack really confusing i then had a completely unsympathetic customer services department,Bad
4886,absolutely disgusting customer service the way i was spoken to by the advisor and the way it was handled was appalling i have been a loyal customer to them since they have been running and they cant even sort a problem out that the previous advisor didnt explain correctly they are a total rip off company they have scammed more money out of me because i cancelled my contract with them because of there rip off prices i would advise anyone looking to join them or who is currently with them to avoid them at all costs i am very very disappointed,Bad
4887,virgin has been the worst experience i have ever had with any internet provider at least every months we lose our internet for about weeks but this time round it just got so bad when an engineer cancelled on us and so they made us wait a month for the next one without notifying us of this change i only found out when i called to inquire why an engineer didnt come that day to which they replied that he had cancelled and the next one was booked in a months time they provided no alternatives in the meantime and gave no compensation or refunds even when we threatened to take this to the ombudsman we are paying for a service but not receiving that service and the worst part is they dont give any refunds or compensations for when they have lacked in providing us the service that we pay money for were stuck in a contract with them but wouldve left ages ago,Bad
4888,they disconnected my business line and after hours of continuous complains they told its a problems of billing department and those people from billing department cancelled my line even after getting every single penny of their bills the thing is that its not ended here they make my line working again but after one month of waiting still the handset doesnt show number in display and to resolve this i have contacted them more then times and they are just bullying with me by transferring my call to different departments after referring my case to engineer twice nobody turned up i hate this service providers,Bad
4889,i have had many years with talktalk at a very good price i was offered different boosts free of charge not realizing it would come to a end i have suffered poor internet which i put up with suddenly no warning over double the price this has answered one question why i could not convince my friend who always came back with not gaining anything by changing he is sticking with sky,Bad
4890,i havent had full service for three weeks now and whenever we ring to enquire we get off but i notice we are still paying the bill as if we have full service i have a disabled husband who relies on the tv for entertainment and its not good enough,Bad

4894,extremely bad experience constant misinformation and broken promises hidden charges incorrect direct debits and constant promises of call backs to sort issues from managers and they never call awful awful service,Bad
4895,they used to be good then we switched away because of exorbitant charges then switched back but now theyre dreadful weve just spent minutes trying to stream a tv programme all other devices switched off phones computers the lot and it still kept stalling and crashing i guess if theyre trying to get us off the internet and back to books theyre doing a good job,Bad
4896,i bought a phone from them on the th of december as a gift for someone i knew i wouldnt get it immediately due to the busy period however these guys sent out the phone to me but instead of writing my name in the delivery address they wrote a random vodafone account number this caused the courier to refuse the package and it was sent back to them i am still waiting for my phone and have no idea what is going on as their customer service is useless and rude they have taken the money but show do not show any willingness to fix the please avoid,Bad
4897,been trying to move my account since january still waiting now as they have seemed to find problems along every way and now blaming for a problem that they claim wont be resolved till april th get spent round the houses when you call and then when you bring up the problem just act sheepish say they will call you back which they dont bother doing and only give you answers once you force them into it by persisting for hours on end stalin and hitler would get more favourable customer service after making a call back as thier world class services seemed to have forgot they were ment to call me about an update they have now tried to feed the same fake story as they gave a month ago and apparently have just now moved my order on sat in that inbox a while gathering dust lets see what happens on monday when i call as they seem to think hrs will have a problem solved before they can book an actual human to turn up and install a service,Bad
4898,vodafone are not a company i would recommend its a shame as their tariff is great but ive tried contacting them multiple times as i would like to upgrade my phone and i was instantly put on hold this happened everyday for a week morning noon or night i will be going elsewhere for my next contract i have gone elsewhere due to the fact that vodafone are actually crap their customer service is something to be desired too,Bad
4899,just upgraded my full house package to a deal which was more expensive for broadband understand that i was on a promotional deal for the tv and broadband bundle but their refusal to even entertain the idea of a discount for an existing customer is arrogance of all customer service people who id spoken to throughout the day was disgusting due to their own infrastructure offering faster speeds they sneer at the idea of you using an open reach line as an alternative if you want anything above mbs at one point i was told youre paying for a premium product you wouldnt go to a ferrari showroom and ask for a this tool fails to realise is if i were buying a ferrari id be paying for the experience of buying one as much as i am for the car so if i ring virgin media and they offer a premium product then i expect to be treated at the very least like a human being and not in the disrespectful contemptuous manner in which they didi think virgin media need to take a good hard look at themselves if this is indeed their business model its left me feeling very bitter towards their business to a point where i would love to see a decent service using g to obliterate their business model just out of spite there is no place for a business which believes it can have a stranglehold over its customers in this way historically all monopolistic businesses fall from grace sooner or later especially when a newer more innovative business comes about and this is exactly what i am wishing for so that we as the average consumer have the freedom to choose a service which values us and the competition available to prevent one company such as this slap us in the face and expect us to pay them,Bad
4900,useless vodafone dosnt let you log into your online account after all correct passwords pins etc then when called up to get access and upgrade phones they refused my correct details saying failed security yrs ive been with them as a business customer and they didnt care told me to go to a vodafone shop so instead im going to head to an ee shop buy all my staff new phones from them and cancel all the phones at vodafone,Bad

4904,exceptionally bad service impossible to contact,Bad
4905,where do you start with talk you get what you pay for theyre cheap but cheap for a was weeks late to get nearly hours on phone to call centres where staff struggle with the up to mb broadband but can get speeds as low as to talk tv is very jerky and not very to reset the router and talk talk tv box on average to times a week just to get things working properly like the plague bite the bullet and spend maybe an extra or per month on sky or bt as the savings arent worth the stress with talk talk now stuck with them for over a,Bad
4906,zero stars for customer calls in total dealing with a variety of customer service issues such as calling to change direct debit date still billed to be taken out on the wrong date incorrect amount billed told it was a mistake and to ignore it incorrect amount taken numerous calls back never happened calls to request plume pods told misinformation about the cost of plume pods requested call recordings and transcripts that are to arrive likely to go to the information commissioner waiting hours to speak to a customer service manager who called me back the next day then hid behind a keyboard and offered me without addressing all of the complaints i made nor did he clarify it is a fso complaint plus hours on the phone service is so bad i have requested a meeting with a director media disguising service go to sky,Bad
4907,i finally ended my contract with vodafone broadband where i had a g device if one person is say watching netflix nothing else customer service process is horrendous you message a robot through the app and then you message back and forth and it gets you this broadband wherever possible,Bad
4908,we have been with zen for so long we cant believe how they are treating us we are both in our s and we use half our limit allowed for broadband we have a simple broadband package with line rental plus for which we pay every weeks we are moving home and zen say we cannot continue to have this package at the new address they want to change us to an unlimited package which is not suitable as we dont need unlimited if we were new customers it would be understandable for them to say our current package is no longer available it is available though because we are getting it at the moment so it is available to us the area we are moving to has limited access so mbs would be the fastest we could get there are no plans in the near future to improve access moving at our age is disturbing enough without hassle from our isp we are now looking for a new provider possibly with a package more suited to the elderly and their needs zen should hang their head in shame treating long standing customers this way update have sent info they asked for was expected to go for unlimited which we dont want and told mbps upload of mbps and cost would be an increase of per month may not be a lot to those of you on a salary but on a small pension it is per week is a great deal of cash to us we budget weekly we know the area we are moving to is not under consideration for improvement and is poor for internet and mobile standard is all we can hope to get definitely not better even superfast isnt available watch this space but we are not holding our breath wed march nothing to date pm,Bad

4913,i wish i did not switch to virgin media my broadband signal is always going and doesnt reach every room of my small house even though it was sold to me as super fast broadband when i switched they did not set up my direct debit so they charged me a late fee i have tried to raise several complaints by phone and via the complaint link on their website to try to sort out my bill i have had no response to any of my complaints after several months i am still struggling to get virgin to set up a direct debit for me and to remove a late fee i would not recommend virgin media because of my shocking customer service experience with them,Bad
4914,i have often found the sales staff in stores helpful and polite however like many of the reviews here when you have a problem the support centres are extremely poor and if it becomes a complaint the head office are even more when i contacted the main group the parent company has no apparent interest in tesco shambles thankful i am now with an organization that puts service along with sales,Bad
4915,totally let down by their customer service,Bad

4945,talktalk highlighted a fault on my line they offered to sent an engineer to my property at no charge to me all i had to do was click the link i did then i waited and waited noone got in touch and when i live chat with them they are less than helpful im told i have to ring them possibly numerous times their words not mine i was then told the chat was being terminated and if i wanted the fault rectified ring them what is the point of a chat line which i was asked by one of them to use if i am then told to ring on a mobile pretty disgusting service,Bad
4946,after waiting more than two weeks for my order of two iphones longer than i was promised by the tmobile rep tmobile cancelled my order without informing me i only figured this out indirectly through my credit card company who said they had flagged a tmobile transaction for possible fraud since tmobile was placing several on the account during the backorder period every tmobile rep i talked to about this told me something different and transferred me to a new office by giving me a phone number and making me start all over again few knew what they were talking about many couldnt even tell the order was cancelled or bothered to really look into the issue after hours on the phone i pieced together that tmobile cancelled the order when one of their charges was rejected by my credit card again on suspicion of fraud because of odd billing practices tmobile never tried to contact me to check on the credit card charge or even to tell me the order was cancelled tmobile would not reactivate the order either and told me id have to start from scratch ordering alone took an hour on the phone and that id be put in the back of the long line to receive my iphones i could go on and on about the ways mobile handled this whole affair terribly but ill leave it at this i have no respect or trust for this company,Bad
4947,years with them endless billing problems poor service and substandard communications smokescreen or ai poor connections and unintelligible call centers consistently overcharged misled ill informed and currently stuck on an overpriced contract as a consequence of sharp practice corporate dishonesty and excuses and typically their reply is text on trust pilot offering for me to spend loads of time trying to outwit ai to speak to endless call centers rather than call me which as a tele communications provider one may hope to a possibility as a lo long standing telephone service customer i have spend sooooo very much time attempting to get vf to honour their contracts ican only assume it is by design rather than accident,Bad
4948,please set up my account over the phone virgin media made a spelling mistake and so i have never had a contract i cannot access my calls to virgin media have no effect except the email is now correct but i still cannot logon to my account apparently it takes a long time for the it department to do anything and nobody will notice that there is no problem taking my wifi works perfectly but it is impossible to access my virgin media account so despite all the phone calls i dont know officially if i is not good enough,Bad
4949,vodafone you are the most useless bunch ive come across in a long wasnt such a delay in getting my complaint resolved because as i clearly mentioned on oct you have not acted to reply to the written complaint sent to you months ago nor any of the reminders and online submissions you have not yet resolved dont do facebook or twitter i dont do social full stop i do use trustpilot to highlight outstanding or customer service yours is the policies provide that you will respond to written complaints what can be more simple than dealing with text on paper or electronic text via your own complaints portal but you have repeatedly and consistantly failed to do so how do you explain rd november vodafone from vodafone uk days sorry to hear there was such a delay in getting your complaint resolved if theres anything you still need help with please get in touch with my team on facebook at facebook or via twitter social media team,Bad
4950,like many other people on here joined tesco mobile through quidco as they were offering a incentive once i was locked in contract tesco declined that incentive for invented reasons spoke to quidco at length on this matter and tesco were definitely the party that declined the cashback feel duped by tesco not the sort of behaviour you expect from a retailer of their as explained i already escalated it with quidco this was their reply we do our best to ensure that cashback is paid but unfortunately it is in the hands of the this was final reply when i escalated it morning scott thank you for coming back to me ive had a deeper look into this for you and tesco have said that they believe you have migrated over to a pay as you go pre pay contract now rather than keeping the pay monthly contract which is why your cashback was declined that was not true it was tesco lies whats one more star review in a sea of star reviews i cant believe tesco would put their name to this shameful behaviour,Bad
4951,i have never felt the need to review a business until now their customer service is so badly organised and actually speaking to someone who can help is impossible i cannot stress strongly enough that you should not deal with this company,Bad
4952,talk talk customers who have not had to call them to ask for help before big warning they will not help especially when they are at fault there attitude your call will go around in circles expect long time being put on hold still not get the problem solved even if it is something that is putting children s lifes in danger please believe me because i am getting the most disgusting service treatment off them spending on average minutes on the phone before they drop the call then when you ring back you go through the same circle,Bad
4953,i have just had the worst experience of customer service ever i rang virgin to arrange a house move and installation in my new house after mins on the fone it was finally sorted a day later i had to ring them again as my house move was put back a week easy enough to change the date of installation you would think well after mins and different people i had had enough i cancelled my contact there and then even that was hard work as long as virgin use foreign call centres i will never go back to them they are bloody useless,Bad
4954,virgin made appointments to fix tv box and failed to turn up or turned up time fix apologies no shambles,Bad
4955,terrible experience switched from another supplier then waited months to find that my order had been cancelled and with zero contact made and zero reason available when i got in touch to ask what was happening with my order not only that their website didnt work for a new customer so i had to call them and the process was painful the agent wanted to go through my details four times to check that every spelling was correct awful company badly run dont waste your time,Bad
4956,like many others trying to pause bt sport as there is no huge call waiting times finally got through and was given two options free three months then revert to full price for the package or continue to the contract asked about cancellation and the cancellation fee was really a company like bt can do so much better or can have paused sky sports today via a simple online need to register this issue as a formal complaint and certainly if this policy is not changed quickly they will lose all of my business at next renewal which is broadband mobile and bt previously interested in their new tv packages but not a few of our mps are looking at this issue because if they wont change they should be forced to alternatively i wonder of anyone has any thoughts on whether they are breach of contract,Bad
4957,really cannot wait until this contract ends ive been charged for talk talk tv which i never agreed to they added this onto my bill months after i took out the contract when i spoke to a rude customer service advisor that i didnt request this and after a considerable amount of trying to explain this to her i did get my money back speed is very very slow after this cannot watch iplayer or any streaming and ive been receiving emails stating im using too much and urgently need to upgrade for faster broadband these dates given i was away or working so wasnt at home this is a con and scaremongering as if i want to sign up with them for another months advice avoid at all costs,Bad
4958,botched up takeover left me without broadband phone and tv over christmas and holiday period for a month rd dec to th jan their pre installation team is in shambles who will not do a basic signal check before the arrival of engineer the installation team is even more pathetic who will arrive late and then want to just wash their hands the new date for installation is given after days in the interim you are left high and dry because the old service provider has switched off the service as phone number was being g taken over by virgin avoid,Bad
4959,as usual cannot talk to anyone upgrade to get better speed does not happen now technical have to get involved surprise surprise as if i did not know that was going to happen,Bad
4960,asked why virgin media customers could leave but loyal o customers could not no response i now pay pm for mb new customers just extraordinary then to read their new promo nobody likes feeling as though theyre being shortchanged especially in a cost of living crisis,Bad
4961,never again heres a situation they put me in when i opened up the account they entered my address wrongly into the computer whenever i called to enquire about anything to pass the security checks i had to tell them my address because they inputted it in wrongly i could never pass the amount of time i wasted with this company is when i finally read out the crazy arrangement of characters they put down as my address i could not for years get them to change the details on their system every time i asked i was told it would be fixed and then nothing this review is the last time i will ever have to exert any form of energy on this sh show of a company good bye,Bad
4962,sure purchase virgin media broadband its great for the first months they will let you know when they are going to increase your bill and how much they are increasing it by until it comes to contract expiration then they charge you the world without any kindly prompts that your contract is due to expire and on top of that you have to give days to cancel so thats another on top of your bill but this is all outlined in your contract of course which you agreed to between months service is a joke if you want to discuss something then youre put through to the foreign team if youre trying to leave them they put you through to the scottish team just to make understanding them a little easier instead of trying to keep you as a customer they genuinely dont care i asked if they could do me a better deal than i was paying the best they could do was just internet no mention of let me see what i can do for you no checking their bundles to see if they could offer me anything top it all off when you go to check their deals its all for new customers going to run out of new customers eventually virgin media then what will you do perhaps look after your existing customers though i feel this is not waste your time they clearly dont want loyal custom,Bad
4963,service keeps dropping at night and during the day as well,Bad
4964,really slow unhelpful service and rude employees,Bad
4965,after marrying my ex getting virgin media is the worst decision i have made in my life i have had to move houses they do not provide the service in my new address neither in my sisters houses or closest friends houses i have checked all the postcodes they are now ripping pounds off my bank account i find this absolutely unfair expensive and unreasonable and ill make sure i never get any other virgin services again in my life,Bad
4966,dreadful service from vodafone avoid this company at all costs we have limped through years of very poor service with this company internet has been inadequate for our domestic needs and ive constantly been running off g we decided to upgrade and stay with vodafone in the hope of improving the service and were sent a new router which was faulty after hours on the phone trying to set it up they refused to accept the fault or to send another router so we asked to terminate the new contract as we were within the day cooling off period and to place us back on our old package for the time being today they cut us off completely as they failed to place us back on our old contract the earliest they can reconnect us is in two weeks which is totally unacceptable their mistake has caused great stress for my son who is in his final year of university due to coronavirus he is totally reliant on our internet to complete assignments to revise and sit his exams in january we are in tier so going elsewhere for service is not an option he has now had to approach the university for extenuating circumstances and extension for his assignments well done vodafone youve played a blinder causing an enormous amount of stress at a time thats already stressful needless to say we have moved to another company but still have to wait weeks very disappointed,Bad
4967,i have written a review before hand however i have had to delete that review as it didnt let me post another after another horrendous experience with talk talk there is a reason why they have out of on here shouldnt even be that this company is probably one of the worst companies i have ever had to deal with i have had no services for days on days rang every single day been on the phone for hours getting passed from team to team having to explain the situation every single time i was in the middle of completing a change of ownership as i live in my grandmothers house who passed away last year and i now live in her house until it is sold after the days of calls etc to them and hours of being on the phone to them the last person i speak to kindly informs me they have just decided to disconnect the services internet and the phone line my grandmother had that number for years years which i wanted to keep for the foreseeable future which is understandable then i get told i have to have my own account to retrieve the number i would not want to have a talk talk account with the horrendous service i have received completely disgusting please read reviews before using this company dont understand with all these bad reviews how they havent been investigated by ofcom absolute nightmare of a company do not use,Bad
4968,ive had a horrible experience with ees broadband service ever since ive joined months ago the router barely has enough strength to connect to the tv which is in the same room the router just blacks out every few hours which has made working from home hell ive been completely cut off recently after threatening to report them to the financial ombudsman although they claim its just coincidence and that the problem lies with the line other major broadband providers have voluntarily taken part in a compensation scheme for customers when problems with the connections arise while ee have not decided to take part in it ive tried countless times to contact them in the phone but they just blame the problem to bt and take no responsibility at all for the poor service star is too generous avoid them at all cost,Bad
4969,without doubt the worst company i have ever had the displeasure of dealing with to make matters worse i am still dealing with them moved home and phoned to disconnect services last september told we would have to pay a break fee which we accepted told it would be taken directly and account closed a month or so later we get a text from lady who bought our old house letting us know she was unable to set up internet due to block turns out our service had not been closed down and was still active phoned talk talk again told it was closed fast forward to beginning of october made aware that the our account was still open phoned again cut off phoned again line dropped after an hour or so on phone finally told account was now closed down november online account still showing as active so phone again over an hour on hold and being transferred assured account is closed beginning of december receive an email letting us know that we are due them break fee money for services couldnt bare to phone again so do online chat and a bit hours later on chat talktalk finally accept responsibility for not closing down account properly broadband closed down but phone line still active they accept financial responsibility and say they will settle any amounts due etc told i need to contact them again after the th of december to ask for credit to be applied contact them again via chat on the th of december told the credit has been applied finally i never ever have to deal with talk talk again if only another email received at the beginning of january shock we still owe them money i contact by chat again told the credit has been applied and to ignore emails asking for to today th of january letter received via post letting me know i still owe them money and i should pay before handed to debt collector which could impact credit score what is so difficult how can people at this company tell me my account is closed how can people tell me they will settle the final bill and that i never have to contact talktalk again yet my account still seems to be open and i am still being chased for money if you are checking trust pilot reviews before entering into a contact with talktalk please dont do it you will waste hours of your life trying to sort any problems you will spend hours having to repeat yourself terrible company,Bad
4970,very disappointed i bought samsung s over weeks now i still havent received force seems lost the item asked me to contact the supplier when i enquired with bt shop i was told it will take another working days to investigate i was so looking forward for my new phone very disheartening experience i am having i just want to cancel my order and get my money back,Bad
4971,you charge to much i need a discount as im struggling to pay,Bad
4972,bad service drops out frequently and with out an explanation staff are unhelpful internet is a crucial utility and virgin seem by letting their customers go without if i had another option in my area i would take it,Bad
4973,truly the worst most corrupt organisation i have dealt with if you are considering a package dont they make it absolutely impossible to ever cancel your account you get passed from one person to another hours of time wasted always the phone line goes dead before you can complete your cancellation however if you want to upgrade no problem easy as anything,Bad
4974,spent two hours with multiple people in the online chat i went from customer service to tech support who me and sent me back to service without any warning or to constantly repeat my problem speed boost not working and dealing with staff not listening to me at all and running me in go with talktalk their customer service is terrible they will rip you off and flat out lie to you please go with a different provider if you are considering talktalk,Bad
4975,horrendous service my broadband has been down more than it has been working the excuse is always that there is a serious issue that will take a long time to fix then virgin has the audacity to increase fees for the awful service and sneakily change me to an month contract that they never explained to me when i requested a reduction in the fee i would not recommend nor would i ever choose to use virgin media again unless i have absolutely no option as was the case now,Bad
4976,virgin media went off took days to get an engineer to fix told my whole service broadband phone and tv would all have to be off to get any chance of compensation having trouble with my account for you taking the wrong amount when i was in credit due to an over payment you had rang helpline was told different explanations over a week period to what had went wrong eventually had to threaten cancelling account before i got a reasonable explanation not a satisfactory one still not happy with explanation but stayed with virgin as i was told it wold be nearly to cancel contract,Bad
4977,after years being a loyal customer upgrading my phone year after year they failed to deliver my phone with dpd after week from ordering charing me monthly payments and refusing to send out another device until dpd returns the lost one so now i am without a phone and can not do any of my remote work,Bad
4978,spoke to ravi on live chat very poor arcadia customer service model adviser was rude abrupt and insulting and said many times anything else i can help u with they didnt help at all made problem worse they ignore email complaints dont call u also they send emails from a no reply email address worst company every very expensive utter rubbish dont use them avoid at all costs if anything goes wrong they ignore ur complaints great business model,Bad
4979,completely awful sales and customer service i had been using an old iphone for several years as i couldnt afford to upgrade however it came to the point where i really needed to so i went ahead and rang ee and told them i couldnt afford more than a month i was talked into going for a contract at a month which was ok as it got me a slightly better phone before i have even got my first bill they have increased the bill to a month they are claiming this was said in the terms and conditions fine but why was this not flagged up by the salesperson when i explained my situation and what i could afford they are now refusing to change my contract and just come back with scripted every time you speak to someone i feel really let down and duped at a time when were all struggling absolute rip off merchants,Bad
4980,its a shame you cant choose stars terrible customer services terrible connection for internet extra charges even though its a fixed price contract check the small print its all lies they can charge you extra as we found out paid for mbps broadband and get mbps really dont know why i bothered changing will be cancelling as soon as possible,Bad
4981,it was about my new contract with o my friend recommended me to join o but unfortunately the day day i had a bad experience with all the customer agents one of the worst i have ever came across no one has a knowledge about anything i was on the call for more than hours and still my query wasnt solved just for a small change that i placed a order and i want to change the memory of the phone my phone wasnt even dispatched yet they could have done it easily but they just keep transferring my calls from one person to another it was so annoying and waste of my time as well with o i would never recommend anyone to join o i wasted my working hours no one should go through this at last lucky deepak was the one who solved my problem and had a correct knowledge about the product and service thanks to him,Bad
4982,i just got a mobile wifi dongle of theres and the credit run out a pm now there was no way that i could top up my dongle until pm the next day and ring up customer services thats a joke to try and get hold of someone there you have to select that you are trying to leave them then the person on the phone was very rude ok he solved my problem which should not of been a problem in the first place but didnt care less about it vodafone are the worst phone company for customer help i have ever deal with do not use vodafone if you can avoid it it will give you nightmares avoid them like the plague,Bad
4983,terrible slow internet that constantly cuts out i have to disconnect and reconnect every minutes or so which makes streaming tv very frustrating some websites also refuse to work due to the poor connection which prevents me from studying i genuinely have to just give up and try again at a less busy time will never ever give virgin my money again,Bad
4984,here we go again contract expired which i forgot about nice of them to remind me tried to get new deal after minute wait on phone advisor was not very me poor offer which i have cancelled new customers getting same deal and tv for a month cheaper been a loyal customer for years plus all family members customers also will not renew with either,Bad
4985,i have been complaining to vodafone for over a year about my speed on the internet i pay for at least mbps but on using their speed check tool it is only averaging mbps when i check with other speed check apps it is only mbps and with which it is only mbps they recently sent out a new router and its just as bad my advice to vodafone is dont offer what you cant provide,Bad
4986,bought a phone a month ago all i wanted was to keep my same phone number as i use it as security for other accounts and for my business the vodafone store assistant advised me to send him a text just before a full month had gone by so that he could temporarily switch my contract to pay as you go to keep my old phone number and then it would go back to the pay monthly plan i had agreed well i texted him no reply back a few hours later i had no service used the house phone to try find the number to contact the store low and behold it doesnt exist i call the call centre i get passed on to different people times i repeat my story times explaining that i only did what the assistant told me to do and i need my old phone number back lets just say english wasnt the womans first language and after having me on hold for mins she comes back with the solution you have to pay to get your number back theres no other way and you have to go into store to do that i explained im not going into store for a rd time for someone elses mistake and it takes me hr to get the closest store she apologised with fake sympathy and was utterly robotic despite me explaining times it was the store assistants error for not getting back to me in the first place at that point i had been on the phone for an hour put on hold and passed on multiple times i was demented had a slight break down composed myself called up one more time all teary still and i explain once more i desperately needed to keep my old phone number the assistant dylan spoke english as a first language for a start and couldnt have been more helpful switched my number to the right one and sorted everything in under mins no charge either thank you dylan why doesnt vodafone have more people like him appalling otherwise having the audacity to try and charge a customer a fee for something that was an assistants fault is a disgrace,Bad
4987,it is the worst company in the world they are i have been paying for two months and without internet i call them and they do not solve anything they wont let me cancel because i have a one year contract that they are breaking and they tell me i have to pay to cancel i do not recommend it they are scammers,Bad
4988,fed up with slow speed and agent useless so still did not get any help fuming is not the word,Bad
4989,i ham still waiting for my purchase any idea when it will arrive thanks,Bad
4990,would avoid a engineer was meant to be out between on friday so i sat in all day they did not show up or even contact me to say they are not attending the appointment to fit my broadband i phoned the next day to be told id have to wait another weeks i explained that i was a student and needed the internet for my exams this week but they didnt really care think this is completely out of order when paying for a service,Bad
4991,terrible customer service and rubbish internet,Bad
4992,ive been a customer of them for over years but the customer service is terrible ive just ordered a phone upgrade and the confirmation email has just come through incorrectly so i call back straight away but this time i have to wait for ages as im not spending with them im just trying to sort a problem then to be told that they will have to call me back in days time as the system wont let them rectify this right now,Bad
4993,just cut me off without resolving issue about my emails seems to be blaming apps which it wasnt,Bad
4994,scum network provider poor signal pretty much all the time but in a few area not a single bit so ee turn your phone into a useless brick even theyre highly bragged about mb yes you read that correctly mb emergency data is not available to those most in need offered only to those better off who dont ever even need such a meagre offering just a hyped crappy network company everything they shout about is just blatant lies of a terrible company best signal bla bla bla reality is struggling to get a useable connection i have a g iphone and app show how very poor the speeds are the needle barely even raises from not recommendable to anyone really unless you want to turn your phone into a calculator only the date below says today but its permanently crap update after replyi dont use facebook or twitter so no use just wishing i never began my contract with ee full of lies and weak signal weak internet speed nothing like what they promise cant wait for my contract to end and will not be renewing this rubbish service i used to get good internet speed while on pay as you go for years around mb switched to contract and its dropped lower and lower ever since dismal speeds now ee are fraudsters avoid them,Bad
4995,waste of money stick with qantas the staff are rude there is always a catch even when they almost kill a person due to allergies they were made aware of they have no remorse and off k points as if that is worth anything that isnt even a flight from canberra to melbourne they know they are safe because even though they make their own laws in policies no one can afford to take on the company so there is nothing anyone can do i do hope the company suffers massive financial strife and someone takes it over and revamps it removing all rude staff on the telephone lines,Bad
4996,truely service agents working from a script they obviously do not understand cannot escalate to a supervisor a disgrace would have given it a zero but not able wasted hours of my life that i will never get back and still no fix broadband speed is glacial,Bad
4997,i switched to virgin months ago and have been regretting it ever new v box seems rather buggy and the ui is long winded and rather clunky ive had a constant problem of keeping the two boxes connected to each other this means more often than not i have manually connect each box when i have contacted the tech department about this i was asked to connect the wireless box through a power line adaptor which isnt included if this a known issue then virgin should supply the adaptor rather than expecting customers to have to buy demand is hit and miss and regularly crashes an hour plus into a film then you are unable to get back to the film as it comes up with all manor of error codes its that bad weve given up with films unless on netflix or amazon but virgin dont care about on demand problems as the first thing you are always told when you call up is that its free and that they dont charge for are supposed to have up to mbps fibre with an average peak time speed of mbps according to virgin we are lucky to get over mbps and thats wired wireless is hopeless i hadnt experienced buffering for years until switching but even this morning the speed was so poor iplayer and netflix gave up we are on our second modem and still its rubbish im always getting moaned at by the family that even twitter instagram will not even load i myself never used to use up all my mobile data allowance each month that was until switching to virgin fibre weve had engineers out a number of times and all i get is well it seems ok and give it a few days and it should be up to speed it never gets up to virgin is a nightmare most of the call centre staff are abroad and struggle if your question is not on their script i even had a scottish advisor shouting down the phone at me she apologised when she realised that the advisor in india had transferred me over telling me her department dont speak directly to customers or so she said the wait times are often long between minutes from most of my an engineer out is hit and miss often late or not within time slot you are given and even had them not turn up at all good luck getting an explanation or check your bills as virgin appear to like to make them up without rhyme or reason and again when questioned i have never got and explanation or apology for why this has happened more than once it even took months to sort out the direct debit as they would set it up but not action deals look very good compared to competitors but i now know why virgins competitors know youll end up going back to them so get away with the higher cost the old saying you get what you pay for is certainly true with virgin roll on the th february,Bad
4998,i have been with different internet providers over the years as i always shop around for best deals and talktalk is the worst broadband provider by far their customer service is non existent when you put complaints in and want to speak to the manager they do not stick to the policy and even when you quote ofcom policy they dont want to know i work from home and i have been with out broadband for over a week now they just dont care they dont check any notes on your account they dont offer resolution and when i waited a statement from ofcom regarding compensation for losing work they just dont care they are quick to take your money though and when your months contract expires they put you on the most expensive plan with even letting you know,Bad
4999,the worst customer service ever unprofessional inefficient never do what they say they are going to do wrong engineer sent times to bury a cable still not done literally they just dont care always gives false assurances,Bad

9146,yes its annoying when the chats not working the trick is to keep trying as it becomes available when an agent is free and yes you quite often have to wait for ages on the phone but and this is a huge but their tech support really do go the extra mile to help they are polite even when i have been a bit exasperated on the end of the phone they are happy to try different solutions and investigate faults they will explain things and will try and see things from your point of view some things are out of their control but they will explain what can and cant be done and they will even come up with novel suggestions they also dont talk down to you they adjust their approach based on your perceived level of understanding which is a big plus and saves time dont get me wrong in the many many years i have been a customer i have moaned at them several times but i have to admit they have always come up is in short supply at the moment but these guys seem to have it in buckets i was even surprised when the top man richard tang himself replied he also made sure one of his tech guys contacted me to provide a full and detailed explanation as to whey i couldnt do something i wanted to do and even gave me a potential happen to have an open fault at the moment and within minutes of my reporting it they have arranged for an engineer to visit the visit is in hours time on a saturday so my only complaint is that i have to get up early and go into the office to meet the yes sometimes you have to wait but the wait is generally worthwhile,Good

9235,after a shambles of an afternoon quickly going into the evening donna at mobile seems to be the one to get it done if you have no time to read on the review title says it all but for those interested in the context bought a sim at a local shop came home inserted sim into the device then made a cuppa then followed guidance on the i followed the link to the relevant landing page on their website i was asked for the sim phone does not come with the sim card after looking online trying the chat service then over the phone customer service i was given a number to type into the phone to bring up the number as by default it is to be sent by text once the sim is inserted in the device for the first time that text came about an hour later after all that next was to select a plan and top up online after three attempts using payment worked on the phone again ill explain below what happened when i rang first the customer service handled the registering of the sim and the top up aspect as when on the website it didnt work computer says no again although instead of picking the monthly plan as i was assured would happen after the registering of the sim and the top up part of the call the call ended which was not okay in my view as i was assured otherwise coupled with the experience of the first call to the customer service which directed me to a denmark call centre who could not help with a uk based sim card where at that point there was no other option but to hang up and ring the same number again once that happened and i got through again to the customer services i was told i could not get the offer on the monthly plan that i had in the basket on the website that failed to accept payment methods i could not get the deal as that it was an online only deal and not a new customer is what was stated online that wasnt helpful i wasnt getting anywhere i then went on to the online then found out it wasnt that it was an online offer that was the issue but because the top up happened first the plan couldnt be activated then at that price and because computer says offer cant be applied so a refund was sought and is being processed at the moment what was clarified is that the chrome or windows edge are the best browsers to use for the website still with me nearly there i still had a mobile number to port over from another provider i had the pac code its basically an online form to process this i chose to use the chrome browser it didnt work then safari then firefox to no avail so guess to the webchat webchat this time gave me donna to speak with and within a few minutes had the port done on her side i just have to wait for the process to complete but i trust it will go have to say that nothing was too much trouble for donna and was very helpful especially in contrast to the multiple customer service agents and website experiences in the previous hours so why the five despite the precious time spent most of what i sought help with was accomplished some processes like the refund and number porting will take time as expected the monthly plan i wished to avail of being the exception today which is unfortunate apart from that the amount of time used to set up a sim card is not worth it to me and will keep this in webchat service when available is helpful,Good

9475,i am writing this review of all the feedback that i can see regarding virgin am going to remain anonymous however i would like to point out a few things that i find very hard to swallow regarding comments about the some peoples theories into the we are all facing currently i feel the business are making the right choice into making key workers and the aged and vulnerable and business and those who have a total loss of service a priority there are so many factors too take into consideration that some people are blinded to see such as people damaging there property maybe such as the green boxes general wear and tear incidents upgrading resolving issues where possible hours a day days a week as a business have sore one comment that said i was charged calling my own number this is a joke my response was why are you ringing your own home phone number from your own home phone and secondly did you make that call outside your tariff i do not see any logic in this and would question any reasonable logic to do thati see a lot of complaints regarding the wifi and how it becomes not reliable and intermittent i have found plenty of information and help and videos on their website and other sources to show people how to best manage the wifi and how it works and where i can appreciate some agents are not technically minded there are some that are and go above and beyond to i will finish on is this we all plan for tomorrow but some may never see the end of are some people that have lost loved ones and people in the background trying their best to help those in need as mentioned above or people having bogus men come round trying to con money saying there from there internet company which was on twitter some have no telephone and are aged and if there was a accident they may not be able to call we all as a country have to work together and have mutual respect in understanding even though someone calling virgin media media just remember there trying to look after those in desperate need due to the which nobody including virgin media did not see coming and having to what i can see make adaptations in order to keep the business going with million customers i have extra tv box in the bedroom is not a priority currently but a elderly lady or man whom is struggling to make a emergency call is and i would say remember that next time you speak to agent and you will see that everyone is doing there best for you i think virgin are fantastic and i never had a problem with my service,Good
