0,appalling service would go elsewhere if your looking for new my phone phoned they put a bar on the phone and advised i travel a mile round trip to the nearest store and take some id and i can get a new sim to use in my old phone travelled the miles they never asked for id instead they wanted my password and then spelt it wrong so i was locked out there system in the cribbs causeway bristol store the guy then said there was nothing he could do as the pass word was locked after he spelt it wrong he made no attempt to try and resolve his error as he was clearly only interested in making sales i then travelled back home very annoyed as a long term customer of o i expected a new sim issue to be pretty standard but will never use that stuff again as they were no help at all phoned customer service they said they would contact the store and advise a complaint will be going in and offered as a sorry i was told to go back to the store and they would issue me a sim card this card another miles however i have now found my phone so phoned o over hours to get the sim unblocked and was told by different people that the phone would take hours to come back on but still i have no service hrs later i have made endless phone calls but all they call centre staff are interested in is there stats for the day rather than sorted out customer problems as after all we pay for their wages how come they can bar your phone straight away but when its the other way round they cant am now paying for a contract but have no service so o have actually broken the terms pf the contract i am phoning tomorrow and asking for terminations i will keep you away from o they dont care,Bad
1,i ordered their broadband and had a terrible experience at all initially had to wait weeks for installation the team didnt turn upi was on hold for an hour trying to find out what would happen next the assistant cut off half way through a sentence before we were phoned again and was on hold for another hour during this time i saw a cheaper virgin media deal for the same servicei was offered a new install date weeks from far ive wasted day waiting for an install team that never showed up hours on the phone weeks waiting for in response to virgin medias response below sure delays can happen but this is a week delay after a without any kind of communication i had to spend hours on the phone to get any information about what was going on this is not just a delay issue its a twisted and broken system on many levels providing your customers zero respect or human kindness your response minimising this into just a delay is exactly the kind of arrogance problem im complaining about,Bad
2,i strongly advise against broadband from this company after connecting the new offer the download becomes slower by half the customer service is dramatic and on top of that it is almost impossible to understand them they have an accent so you have to guess what theyre saying they direct you to this speed test page that shows the speed times faster than the vodafone website advise against,Bad
3,we had an installation date set up for today at am to call them to find out what the delay was to be told by a call centre in india that our installation date has been changed extremely bad service considering no one even had the courtesy to call us and let us know then told us rudely we will not be compensated for taking time off work and then the agent hung can keep your services i dont want it if that is how you treat appalling,Bad
4,awful awful hasnt worked for weeks and internet is so box is always disconnecting from router making on line tv watching a and crap service with no customer service,Bad
5,day still waiting for service owe no money to them but expect any day to receive an outrageous bill from them this has been the nom for months and yes i have no service but they will still send you a hundreds escalating to a hundred interest a month they cut you off when you question it how dare i when you call them expect to be on hold an hour and the latest is when you ask who you are the name changes two days ago i was talking to an aran at beginning of call but at end of call he said his name was claire i want to unlock my mob take my number and escape,Bad
6,we have been trying to deal with virgin media in respect of issues and the escalating cost of our package we would like a better affordable deal but these are only for new customers we have had no choice but to cancel our package which costs us in excess of per month this will leave us without a phone line or internet access during these days of restrictions our experience of virgin media is awful we keep trying to register a complaint but we get no response virgin media make it almost impossible to complain about them i cannot hear over the phone and they do not have an email address for customer services if i could have given less than star i would have,Bad

10,virgin media are a company with terrible customer service and no value for loyalty our internet is intermittent and no where near the speeds promised after taking screenshots to prove speeds are diabolical i tried to call them to say i was leaving or to see whether they could do anything it took me mins to get through and mins to just get the person on the other end of the phone to understand my partners name and our account number i then was put through to another department and the phone disconnected and no one called me back virgin media i would like to leave as i cant get this message to you via phone call i request a call back this week early next week to discuss cancelling our contract,Bad

16,absolutely customer service set up a direct debit which they set up for wrong date rang up received abuse on all occasions and was advised to cancel the direct debit did so asked what if an amount needed to be paid because of this they stated cut off and told that nothing can be done do not use unless you want to spend your weekends arguing with off shore call centres and being given bad advise,Bad
17,the operative was very polite understanding and as helpful as possible and spoke to their manager to try and resolve my issue but to no avail i was on line for one and a half hours but talktalk cannot solve my problem which is not being able to access my emails using google chrome as i receive a message from messaging blocking my access i have seen online chats with talktalk dating back to regarding this issue but still not resolved yrs is a long time and still no answer to the problem,Bad
18,wish id read the reviews before ordering terrible service changed installation date left my year old parents without phone internet and tv for weeks caused so much distressed for elderly parents every time we rang customers services they could not hear us and when we finally spoke to someone they kept passing us onto a different agent bad service would not recommend as no resolution,Bad
19,i really regret signing up with virgin media the house i bought already had the connection so i thought it would be the easiest solution terrible error they over charged me which has taken more than six calls and online chats and serveral hours to resolve then after about three weeks my high speed service is hardly usable cuts out during video calls and slow the rest of the time which varies throughout the day the customer support had been appalling making promises which are not kept i have heard messages along the lines of check your contract it says we dont have to provide the full speed you have paid for and constantly told to factory reset my router which makes no difference they use bots and automation to try and keep you as far away from a human as possible im stuck in a contract i cant get out of dont make the same mistake as me,Bad
20,time internet provider have better customer service then these not only have the worst customer service but there customer service is very rude when i first started service the modem delivery got delayed by weeks they even promised someone would hand deliver it to my house but it took two full weeks they blatantly lied to me canceling with them at the end when i left the uk was also terrible at first they said they couldnt close my account and wanted to send me a letter in the mail after i left the country verify my identity finally i got transferred to someone that let me my password and got authenticated worst process i wanted to send back my modem but they wont even give me an address to send it back too they told me to google search the address to send the modem back promise a box days after disconnection after that point im no longer here trying to argue that simple fact alone was unbelievable if i come back to the uk never again am i going to get virgin media,Bad
21,i cant believe it but i wrote a review over a week after talk talk cancelled our broadband order for our house move and then couldnt honour the original service set date so we created a new order at a later date well what do you know talk talk emailed us today cancelling our order again no one can explain why and the customer service have no authority to do anything to rectify the situation we are now in limbo waiting for a manager to call us back meanwhile our original order was to have service set up this coming monday which talk talk are now saying they cannot honour yet again its talk talks mistake so they need to fix it what a shambles of a service we have reached out to talktalk customer service and no one can explain or sort the issue whatever it is as a result youve lost our business,Bad
22,very disappointed with contract they will raise the money between the contract and you cant cancel without penalty charges when i talk with customer service very rude please be aware of terms and conditions before you take the contract,Bad
23,loyal customer for over years and now moving house to an area that virgin media doesnt cover wanted to take my services with me but sadly cannot they want me to pay the rest of my contract out and said they are sure they will be installing in my new area housing estate has been there for over years very much doubt theyll be doing anything soon so disappointed as i love vm but this just stinks and im sure im not the only one,Bad
24,polite guy who was just doing his job so this is nothing personal however i felt aggravated and agitated by the constant phone calls the fact that i couldnt grasp what exactly i was being offered in a clear concise manner i am a busy retailer with not a lot of time to devote to one phone call and yet despite saying this on many occasions to the operative it was like talking to a brick wall it was a thoroughly unpleasant slow experience including on one occasion where i actually put the phone down on the gent because the conversation was raising my blood pressure so much,Bad
25,we have not noticed a significant increase in our internet speed and our internet continues to drop out frequently,Bad
26,the connection is extremely unstable it always disconnect and reconnects,Bad
27,i left due to their pure incompetence whatever you discuss with an advisor will not happen you will need to discuss it a further times often arguing to get it done when i left this happened again and my account was accidentally put into debt i raised a complaint in march my debt was finally cleared in june but im yet to hear a resolution from the complaints team despite chasing weekend call centre seems to have absolutely no idea what is going on,Bad
28,dont bother with this network i was a customer for about years i brought a refurbished phone through them and started a fresh with a new number however imessage wouldnt work on the phone followed the instructions the agent sent me and they also advised i brought a new sim i spent about a week going between gaff and apple to try and resolve the issue both parties blamed the other while i lost contact through work due to the issue now obviously imessage isnt problem which they kept saying however after speaking to apple about the issue numerous times they assured me the issue was with the number after ordering a new sim card that didnt arrive i decided out of frustration to cancel the line and send the phone back and start all over again with another network now gaff are great when everything is smooth but their customer service system and general attitude to when complications arise are a disgrace apple were actually very helpful and did all they could to resolve the issue my advice is to avoid gaff as this is a big detractor having your fingers crossed that its a smooth journey because any bumps in the road and its game over for your time and stress avoid at all cost,Bad
29,rubbish where do they train these them fit a line into my company address and what a mess also wanted the cables tidied up in my home and they just put a new bix in and left the wires where they were you want a job doing well do it yourself and dont get open reach in to do it,Bad

35,they disconnected my business line and after hours of continuous complains they told its a problems of billing department and those people from billing department cancelled my line even after getting every single penny of their bills the thing is that its not ended here they make my line working again but after one month of waiting still the handset doesnt show number in display and to resolve this i have contacted them more then times and they are just bullying with me by transferring my call to different departments after referring my case to engineer twice nobody turned up i hate this service providers,Bad
36,so my bt internet doesnt work my download speed is fine according to bt but my upload speed is nearly zero unfortunately an internet connection will not work without any upload speed bt say they wont even try to fix this fault as they dont guarantee the upload speed only the download speed despite the fact they admit this means i cannot use my internet connection at all a tech support guy even had the nerve to tell me to upgrade to business broadband as still does guarantee an upload speed and they would fix the fault paying a month clearly isnt enough i spent hours on the phone ive been hung up on multiple times even after waiting over an hour to get through in one case i have spoken to people and havent been helped by any of them i literally will have to business broadband for them to fix my fault or go elsewhere to get this resolved they even promised to call me regarding my complaint between pm guess what instead they purposely missed called me at pm they rung my land line with ring and then my mobile twice in quick succession ring each so they didnt even try to get hold of me they just miss called me so they can claim they tried to ring me i was holding my mobile on the nd call and still didnt have enough time to answer it ive now been told that because i missed their call it will be put back days,Bad
37,absolutely disgusting treatment after my father had passed away wouldnt speak to my mom still insisting on talking to account holder even though he had passed not listening all she wanted to do was have her name on the contract opened up a complaint then next thing no internet had been disconnected i called to confirm this with bereavement team then set her up online however the number she had received for many years has now been lost was spoken over cut into and put on hold in the middle of talking to them no respect for those in grieving cancelled the new package straight away took our custom elsewhere never have been treated that way by a internet provider in my life,Bad
38,i started a contract back in it was a month discounted by for the first six months for the fastest broadband and top tv package and phone this crept up during contract until it hit i rang vm and got the package scaled back slower broadband and smaller tv package it went down to around with a loyalty prices started racking up and approached again i rang vm and scrapped the tv completely and went to the lowest broadband price came down again but again started its rise back to at this point i had had enough and rang to cancel forget switching to another provider or emailing them you cant you have to ring which was the worst customer service experience of my life minutes on hold listening to ed sheeran only to be transferred to another department and another wait of minutes all to an indian call centre then transferred to another department another minute wait then they put the phone down this lasted for days and is entirely a deliberate corporate strategy before i managed to escape them this is before we even start on the rubbish wifi coverage if you are sat by the router its ok otherwise and the rubbish tv offerings at first the xl tv package offered me loads of decent box sets in drama scifi kids etc gradually this declined until they were offering me the box set dine with me and trash like that i dont care what they offer i wouldnt touch them again with a barge pole,Bad
39,i have purchased two pay as you go sims for my parents who are visiting and have been unable to register them and am only able to top one up after spending minutes on the phone they told me that they are unable to top up the card and cannot help me further very frustrating process considering i am asking for a simple activation that would be prepaid,Bad
40,shocking bad customers service i ve tried to cancel my contract over their chat i had to chat with different people over days to raise my cancellation notice never thought its so hard to get it done also they have lied to me and trying me to not cancel my contract by using excuses system is not working or you wont be able to keep your number if you cancel now what a pile of lies it put me right off never gonna be back to vodafone,Bad
41,absolutely shocking service dont trust a word they say had to install it my self because the engineer couldnt do it after leaving a mess in my house wifi only works with devices connected the add extra charges to your bill customer service put the phone down on you all the time,Bad
42,what can i say has to be the worst broadband provider on the planet after months of possibly the worst internet connection they swapped me to a business account said i would be able to connect all around my house it was worst than the residential one the problem is they never sort the issue out it keeps dropping out all the time they send an engineer round who spends mins in the property and it just happens to work so we are in the wrong always and you just go round in a circle till you lose the will to live ive spent hours on the phone taking to these awful people ive tried to cancel and now i have to pay to get out of a contract they extended because they changed me to a business broadband band absolute con men stay away dont use avoid at all costs,Bad
43,after supplying pac codes i was assured we would be up running in no time hours later i have no ability to make or receive calls for business friends or family needing to contact me i have been offered a months refund but this does not compensate for my loss of business or connection with possible emergencies needing use of a phone,Bad
44,usual going around in circles that i have experienced for over years with still it continues,Bad
45,i went on line and advised a change of address ok so far if it talk added a service for after i move that i dont need dont want wont use and whats more they will charge i spent an hour on their chat line arguing that they should not put the charge on what do they cant help you youll have to drop everything in the midst of a house move to cancel the charge that your trying to cancel this crazy or what,Bad

47,i have left posting my review for a couple of days to get my temper and blood pressure back to some normality after the treatment i received in the ee phone shop if there was any other mobile phone network company in my area i would use them but unfortunately ee is the only one that works where we live these shops are run by kids who have no idea about how to treat a customer i wasnt impressed the first time i went into the ee store to get mobile from them a couple of years ago i thought the person dealing with me at that time was having a bad day but having to go back to the ee store a couple of time having a problem with my phone the reception and treatment was the same total rubbish the kid who dealt with me at that time just didnt want to be bothered and he didnt know how to solve the problem with my phone i left the shop he went back to sit with the other three nattering and tatting on their phones and i ended up watching youtube videos and solving the problem myself the next time i visited the ee store i was due for an upgrade and dreaded going into the shop because i knew exactly what treatment i would receive and yes it was exactly as i suspected the same standing in the shop waiting to be served and all four or five of them sitting nattering and tatting on their phones and couldnt give a toss that customers were waiting so i approached one of them and asked would he help me with a new phone he was very reluctantly to leave his seat and get to his feet we had not much eye contact through the conversation no explanation of a new plug would be needed and i would need to used my sim card from my old phone and the app that was needed to transfer data between the two phones hadnt been done properly which i had to do myself i think all ee shops are the same where ever you go holidaying in sidmouth again a problem with my phone i went into the ee shop again another kid saying yeah what do you want i explained he took the phone off me fixed it then shouted out whos next there was no communication as to its ok now is there anything else i can help you with just nip back in if it happens again absolutely nothing rubbish manners the majority of my life i have delt with the public in my younger years i managed shops in my mature years i became a nurse its always been important to me how you treat people ok you do get the rude ones but theres ways to handle this ive always strived to be professional and polite giving helpful informative information to get the best for them to be happy with a purchase or treatment ee fails hands down on all of these they dont provide any of this at all id love to meet the person who owns ee ive got a visions in my head its a kid in short trousers with a catapult in one hand and a bag of tadpoles in the other a kid with no idea how to run a company or is he a man that doesnt give a toss or bothered as long as the money is coming in but one day people will have enough of this treatment and go elsewhere but something really needs to be done when people take out contract and buy the phones they deserve better treatment looking at the amount of bad reviews thats on trustpilot it speaks for itself how dissatisfied people are with the company i will say when i have phoned the number to voice my anger or to get help or advice the people on the other end of the phone have been so professional and polite and very very helpful they get the brunt of it because the staff in the shops are rubbish so the one star is for them not the shops or service its pity we cant have them working in the shop instead of the telephone in all first impressions count seeing staff sitting with there feet up laughing and playing about and not serving when people are waiting is bad management please get someone in your shops and sort these kids out teach them how to give good customer service and manners and politeness cost nothing it goes a long posting my review on trustpilot ee have seen it and replied apologising and asked for me to contact the team i already have i did it on the day phoning the number voicing my anger of the treatment i had received so they no about it i dont do facebook or twitter ee have my phone number plus email address if they wish to talk im available,Bad
48,hi team i had a very very bad experience with virgin media customer service its a worst ever service provider to start with every time i need to speak to customer care i had to wait for about hours on call after that when i had to disconnect there services i had to sent that equipment myself and for just month early disconnection they charged me penalty,Bad
49,been with them for about years although this nearly ended due to unbelievable incompetence and stupidity last year i wrote another response then but the thing that still gets to me was when i was debating my point to two different customer service staff they suddenly shouted i cant hear you sir you need to cant hear you bars on my signal line then i heard did it days ago i had a problem being locked out i phoned their helpline keyed in my number as requested we are do not recognise your number send me a bill on it every had to go miles to vodafone shop in shopping no number so gave him account my number but wouldnt deal with my problem as account in my wifes name this was changed over a year ago to include mine so happy to say got home and closed the account by far the worst company i have ever dealt with goodbye and good riddance i am now with o,Bad
50,i was wrongly overcharged twice on new contract awaiting new equipment for over x phone calls later with the three different calls being passed to x different customer service personnel only to be cut off called for the th time still not pilot need to consider making the rating system go down to minus stars for to to accurately grade virgin media customer services being the true correct score if possible they truly are absolutely shocking,Bad
51,virgin never ever process what they agree as the monthly amounts payable i have recently agreed a new month contract again what i was told as to what my forthcoming monthly amounts would be virgin still dont process what was agreed it is every contract everytime,Bad
52,customer service is rude unhelpful and incompetent on live chat even the managers such as shailendra were awful if they are a manager im not im a bit shocked as chose ee because i thought i was getting the best coverage it isnt and that the customer service would be good disappointed in both,Bad
53,the service is so bad i dont get good signal anywhere customer service is bad its hard to find answers without calling so its bad for people with anxiety my phone keeps having several issues functions stop working all the time i have the iphone xr was the cheapest monthly payment i could find but when you get no signal and a bad phone its not worth the price,Bad
54,unstable network speeds vary widely from hour to hour day to day landline service was down multiple times absolutely horrible customer service bordering on offensive,Bad
55,i was with ee previously orange for twelve years both on contact and payg for different devices and i am so glad to have finally changed while the reception and coverage was okay in london but was pathetic when i moved to the countryside the customer service is appalling and there are far too many technical issues some of the problems i encountered while on payg included all credit disappearing from my account immediately after topping up this was only reinstated after contacting customer service on one occasion the phone system only permits up to three bank cards to be used not helpful when cards expire this is not explained on their top up system it just says the payment has failed if you attempt to use another card and it costs money to be put through to an adviser this is obviously unsuitable if you have no credit the online system for topping up consistently denied the existence of my phone number so i could not use it the g on my phone not working at all for over a year ie until i got a new phone which nobody could fix finally and the worst in my opinion when i cancelled a contract for a mobile wifi device i cancelled the direct debit too they failed to process the cancellation and continue to demand payment unknown to be since i had moved house and wasnt receiving the mail by the time i discovered the problem they were demanding several months of payment despite the fact that i had not used the device at all i went into a store to resolve the issue and begrudgingly paid the bill as they were threatening me with prosecution while in store i confirmed with staff that my account was settled so was furious when they continued to demand one more payment ultimately the bill was passed onto debt collectors which scared me as i was at the time and concerned that this would ruin my credit score overall i had a horrible experience with ee and would never go back i am now with which is cheaper has better network coverage and far superior customer service,Bad
56,never in my life have i been treated this bad by a company rude arrogant and and told different things by different my mobile phone asked them will it affect my vodafone broadband was told no and in fact ive had my broadband services limited they didnt tell me that a bill of over will just go out of my account just before i found out before they took it and cancelled the direct debit and pay over the phone for my broadband but thats not good enough apparently and need to set up a direct debit up of a month to pay off some charges etc outrageous cannot wait to change broadband company,Bad
57,bt have been unable to sort out a simple broadband issue the customer service has got worse since it has been in the uk i dont believe it either they are to provide the service agreed and are therfore in breech of their own contract i have spent many hours on the phone to them in the last weeks and still no resolution avoid,Bad
58,total disaster still cant use my phone after days they dont know whats gone wrong today friday th december it now days without a phone every time i go there they say it will be on in hours wish i stayed with vodafone,Bad
59,phone calls and a number of texts not very good experience,Bad
60,thanks for the great review,Bad
61,appalling discrimination against my blind father who is being charged for exceeding a limit he asked ee to a very long story which ee have not resolved but the key admit they didnt offer the help as outlined in their policies for the admit they said they could cap calls over limit but didnt have this said twice in trying to resolve this that they sent a text to warn my dad but as he didnt see due to his disability it their charges no appreciation of the ridiculousness of that admit fault and offered off the extra charges a fairer response would surely to have been to offer the calls at the original tariff the calls themselves are not in dispute my issue is as much that no one ive spoken to at ee can see the issue with regards to the fact this is a clearly discrimination with elements tantamount to fraud and obviously utter incompetence thrown in despite my outlining the full situation their customer service dont see anything wrong with their behaviour im left with no choice but to go to the ombudsman and now see no reason why other customers should not be warned of their appalling insensitive and clearly discriminatory treatment of those disabled blind,Bad

69,changed from bt to ee as the latter were much cheaper but as they say you get what you pay for download speeds much much slower not being up on these things cant understand why as it is all coming down the same telephone line many phones calls to india could not resolve the issue i would guess that on average they were slower than bt eventually ee agreed to cancel the contract after months without penalty no surprise i guess that they charged me a early cancellation fee having said they would not again several phones calls later they have apologised and promised that they would return the amount by today to my bank account needless to say they have an absolute shambles the people you speak to are very nice and they seem frustrated at the nonsense going at all costs i have had my mobile with ee for many years and have found them excellent but no idea why the broadband company is so poor,Bad
70,agreed a deal with the agent on my renewal then when i come to set up the renewal the next agent informs me that its not available do talk talk actually care about what their agents promise do they actually care about customer retention seems customer services still no further deal offered will not carry forward,Bad

80,i have been without a landline for weeks engineers came said its a fault in the road should be sorted next week theyve just informed me it is now months before they can proceed externally my phone is ringing not in the house so people think im either sick or ignoring calls i called virgin media to ask them to take the ring off to show a dead line or put a message up saying that their is a fault on the line they said they cant i asked them to divert the call they said they would but i would have to pay for the diverted calls to mobile i questioned why as the fault is theirs no real answer just policy i asked as they cant commit to the contract to release me from the contract in order that i can get another company to provide a phone service that would be quicker than two months they want cancellation fee how hard is it in this day and age and with all the technology so i either wait until february line been down since november or pay get out fee for a problem that is no fault of my own oh and customer service passed me from pillar to post for minutes with terrible music and them advisor asking why have you been put through to me i dont know i dont work there,Bad
81,only gets a star because they do not go into you want to spend your life on the phone sorting out issues pay top dollar for bottom draw service and still not getting anywhere like a service after so far months then this is the company for that you cannot use with this company are professional competent caring responsive and words you can use are not printable,Bad

84,incredibly poor experience talktalk suggested that they could with my cancellation but all they really wanted to do was persuade me to stay following a lengthy debate and my insistence i was then told i needed to call a number as the agent could not help with the cancellation,Bad
85,paid my bill and had my phone cut off times so far each time i call send them the receipt and bank statements showing its been paid they say its resolved and the next day they cut me off again i will be contacting the ombudsman as this company is inept and cannot be trusted as soon as my contract expires i will be switching to a different company and if they register this on my credit report i will take them to court,Bad

89,was with ee and out of my contract time with them so i ordered an upgrade with them i experienced extremely poor service so i cancelled it and i changed to a different provider in the end,Bad
90,i have only given star as that was the lowest choice i had been with bt for over years with never a problem i have been with talktalk for less than months and have had aggravation the last person i communicated with was a disgrace and somebody should check the recent communication i had with if it wasnt for the fact that for many many years my email address was with i wouldnt hesitate to move and i will tell everybody of my recent experience,Bad
91,i chose to protect the environment but i had no idea that virgin media will not provide a copy of my older bills on my im able to see only the bills for months i sent a text to customer service and they dont have access to older bills either what kind of company doesnt provide their customer the older bills are you serious,Bad
92,staggering unbelievable incompetence as usual something doesnt work as intended call to get it fixed repeat the same information times to somebody who can barely speak english total lottery as to whether or not it gets fixed almost guaranteed something unrelated breaks at the same time,Bad
93,not good i purchased landline phones when i tested them i found them unsuitable due to continuous strolling and being unable to have more than one number for each contact which many other phones allowed including my previous bt phones i requested a refund but bt insisted i return them by track and trace it cost me shortly after this i wanted to purchase some headphones for my wife on our anniversary i paid online with my credit card but was told the next day that the card had been declined ive had this card for nearly years and never had an issue with it as these headphones were the best price available i tried again using my bank card which this time ive had for about years without any problems but again this was declined so on checking both cards i found both had been used by me just the next day and both allowed transactions to go through i believe that bt blocked my purchases until they received the returned phones so even though i have been a faithful customer for nearly years at my address they still dont trust me i will be looking for any products or services that bt provide i shall be happy to provide a review regarding bt to anyone that wants one,Bad
94,for the past year i have had issues with my internet cutting off i am working from home for slc and everytime this happens i am locked in that account until the following day,Bad
95,since working from home i have realised how bad the service is i have missed countless meetings because the internet has gone out and i constantly get the we apologise there are works in your area and theres nothing we can do i have purchased an unlimited g plan with o mobile just so i can do my job and they also failed to provide me with any form of compensation in liaise with automatic compensation scheme so i decided to leave immediately due to failure to provide service months later i am still being charged and havent had virgin in that time never again,Bad
96,i do not have a problem with the actual vodafone service and in actual fact as i travel extensively in europe i find that part very customer service is truly appalling if you unfortunately have occasion to query anything with them you will need to have a stiff drink afterwards the ineptitude is quite on the phone multiple calls numerous reference numbers and nobody cares or does anything about the problem and in fact in my case i have just given up and thrown it at my lawyer to sort out,Bad
97,everyone should complain to ofcom enough complaints would get ofcom involved and force virgin media to change the way they train their customer service experienced very poor customer service calling me arrogant and kept cutting my call to ofcom,Bad
98,i was with o for few years and things were ok so far but recently i was very disappointed with the service the network isnt good but mostly abroad sometimes you can spent hours without any network which is very annoying also i moved recently and asked them to change my address but they told me it wasnt possible i dont understand why the cherry on the cake was when their prices went up and i decided to go somewhere else even in the end the experience is bad my account was closed before i could pay my last bill and nobody is available to resolve this issue i do not o at all,Bad
99,never use talk talk they are the worst customer service ever i was miss sold talk talk i can not even plug it i had not got any internet or land line or tv for weeks or so they never answered there phones so got resolve involved they are still billing me for service i can not use i had to reinstall sky at extra cost as i got no contact they said its my own fault and still they are billing me they said i should of found a way to contact them how with no internet or landline got my mobil which i rang them on it is disgusting how they have treated us never use that are robbing people,Bad
100,awful broadband the ping is so inconsistent outages happened almost every week and internet would be switched off for hours on end dont waste your time the only good thing about them is after four months of complaining i managed to get them to cancel my contract so i can go with bt and get some actual good broadband,Bad
101,wasted minutes on chat and did not achieve anything,Bad
102,broadband network speeds constantly drop below mbs wifi is fine but its carrying a low network speed why am i paying for a speed which only a third of the advertises speed multi phone calls to resolve but no resolution over the last years disappointed,Bad
103,i am having a dreadful time with virgini have called them many times over the past months being kept on the phone minimum of one hour each time they have disconnected my call several times they acknowledge there has been a mistake but cant do anything i need a different department who are never available now they have passed me on o bailiffs for a debt that doesnt debt company are as unhelpful as virgin you cant get through its so bad ive contacted my mp i wish i had never signed with virgin they are casting a shadow over me with their ineptitude i would not recommend them for anything and i would advise you to avoid at all i have been awarded by ombudsman for the shambles virgin media made so they can be forced to do the by you but it will take months,Bad
104,had the most frustrating day with virgin media we have been with them for years and all i wanted to do was reduce my package as we no longer need the tv element i have taken over hours today and been kept on hold and spoken with at least different people various customer departments and they said they cannot offer me any less than what i am already paying for tv fibre and weekend calls although i can see by dropping tv that this should cost less than this and i can get cheaper elsewhere all they wanted was to sell me more tv although i dont need it anymore i really dont understand it should have been a simple call and renewal for them i cannot believe this is how virgin media would treat an existing loyal customer shocking customer service and too long to answer calls i was on hold for half an hour to one department its a shame but they are about to lose another customer when are they going to recognise that top customer service is so important,Bad
105,ive been a long serving customer of tmobile and would recommend them over the years as a mobile provider to consider but this year ive had a change of heart after several issues arose over their customer service back in may i wanted to get a second line the first phone that was delivered didnt work so had to have it returned second phone never turned up and it took be the best part of months to get my money back with a view that id not be returning anytime soon so with my current contract still running i continued on through the year this week my initial phone just stopped working and days later and days waiting at home for a replacement im still without phone and long conversations later im no closer to seeing a phone or a response from tmobile ive had the joy of the press for this press for this and no way of making a complaint and no way of resolving the issue id suggest to all those looking for a new contract not to consider tmobile as once theyve got your money they dont much care for customer care or service,Bad
106,visit call to say will be late but no time i have a life to operative at bt tried to put it back on me she should be a am a paying customer attitude paying and now leaving this bunch of is an ongoing problem over service last week waited hours for them not to turn contacted newspapers about this farce,Bad
107,been with broadband for years then came another price hike just after i came out of contract april time to ring and get a deal was sold a deal that i was told was the same basically the same as what i had i later realised it was full fibre with no land line i wanted to keep my exiting land while we continue work on the house and i would have full fibre once the house were complete did online chat overseas to cancel the order this was done but something didnt ring clear with the chat so rang again to confirm order cancellation and the situation only to discover they had cancel everything and not just the upgrade this was rectified and the lady was lovely and said vodafone are moving away from copper and she couldnt get it any cheaper for me i had some mobile sims with them and would have to stay on the new higher price i received a email confirming cancellation of the order i then go hunting and find a deal with another provider which i find at a month cheaper same speed with the landline today i receive an email confirming my upgrade to full fibre as you can guess i was somewhat confused due to receiving a cancellation email yesterday so yet again i am on the phone to them but this time the man on the phone gave me a very frosty and attitude even though he was aware of my marker on my account certainly not something you do to someone who suffers with ptsd so vodafone whats the point in having markers on peoples accounts if you dont take note of them i told him i was leaving and he said why you telling us this and spouting off about days notice what a difference a day makes customer services lady get the guy just beware they will all be when they are taking your money but when they loose you its the total weeks on and my new provider has sent numerous email etc re my new for vodafone not a dicky bird not even a confirmation of cancellation so yet another call to them to see whats going on should have had an they say i have received nothing the lady on the line and confirmed the line takeover and that they were informed on the th thanks for not telling me infact they were told on the st april by me when i spoke to mr got a txt message confirming my changeover date lets see how this progresses re my direct debit have a good mind to cancel it now as i am paid up to past my changeover date,Bad

111,do not use this company they have hidden fees the worst customer service you will ever receive that try to make stuff up when you prove them wrong i had one telling me about my broadband fee when i dont have ee broadband they also have the worst phone signal in the uk there g does not work in g areas i paid for an early upgrade fee but was still been billed for that contract i paid off and there reason why is because the early upgrade fee doesnt cover paying the contract off they are rated number on complaints please google it never ever trust them because the fee you agree is not the one you will be paying i had this time and time again with them and always proved they me,Bad

181,ee premium price bargain basement customer services and break their most people i would have liked to leave a zero review but that is not have forgotten about the customer plain and my case i was offered if i took bt broadband when i renewed my partners mobile contract a discount it never happened not only that when i enquired ee claimed i was never offered it and it was my job to prove it i wrote to customer complaints but ee never i asked a simple question about a watch upgrade and my daughters out of contract mobile and sim on the watch contract they didnt want to discuss or help on my daughters sim they just ignored me for minutes i terminated the chat in the my review is simple ee make false promises and has forgotten customer service ee charge a premium over organisations with some organisations you get lower quality customer service but you pay less,Bad
182,we signed up to virgin media because of the broadband speed as a result of the ancient copper wires in our building no other supplier can get close charges are not transparent at all though it took me several calls to find a person who was able to explain to me how my charges about per month break down and even then other operatives would disagree in later calls so really virgin medias customer service is shockingly poor staff have a real lack of interest lack of technical knowledge poor listening skills and they are generally rude for example poor international call quality is simply dismissed as down to the phone company at the receiving end on top of that they make test calls to our family members without any proper explanation or understanding that in another country people might speak another language also the broadband connection may be fast which it really is but if the router does not support fast wireless connections its futile after a very long discussion on the phone and being told by the operative that i do not listen after he interrupted my explanation of the problem i was told that a new faster router could be sent to me free of charge after paying for the cost of the courier that is,Bad
183,the worst customer experience ive had in my life and thats saying something i wish i could tell you the whole saga but id end up writing a page essay absolutely offensive level of service to say virgins customer service doesnt even exist would be a compliment constant repeating myself getting nowhere bots agents who are somehow more than the bots being ignored patronised the most frustrating responses like i was being tested in a new circle of hell going in circles over and over waiting hours for a reply agents who smugly pat themselves on the back when theyve achieved sweet fa and havent even read your replies agents who clearly dont have the authority to help me yet pretend they do agents who argue with me even though my evidence was staring them in the face arguing with their own stated company policy being off attempts at bribery with a stream of new offers to get me back in line having complaints procedures without even contacting me let alone doing anything having to restart the whole process every single day with someone new and astonishingly incompetent patiently explaining to no avail writing big clear messages with attached evidence and later on polite fury that i may as well not have bothered with for all anyone looked at them nothing i did to get their attention seemed to matter none of my communication given any attention or respect like it was destined for the trash pile like my frustration was being laughed at agents who seemed to deliberately misunderstand and screw up and then not care a all this from the most basic single request but no virgin were pathetically greedy and wanted to drag this out just so they could extract a bit more money from me even though they werent owed it the terms detailing this written clear as day in their own emails that they desperately tried to contradict it was there simply stated in black and white and they still tried to debate it or ignore it they outright said i could leave without incurring early cancellation charges if in response to a obscene price rise as long as it was before x date i did leave before this date and they tried to charge me anyway the sheer grotesque cheek of a company attempting to contradict its own stated policy that it wrote in customer emails just to exploit its customers further wring out some more pounds hoping the complainant me would give up in frustration before they did but no i can be very stubborn when i feel like im being shown a callous level of corporate disrespect and so i kept trying for literally up having to file with the ombudsman only at the th hour did anyone actually do anything for me a call and apology from a manager oh and an attempt at another offer to get me back and then it was sorted it couldve all been done so easy and instead it took what months of constantly badgering them tearing my hair out at the sheer ineptitude the corrupt greed baked into the system the utter contempt for any customer that isnt a new so glad to leave virgin i know all these companies are awful but how virgin treated me was so that i refuse to give them my money any more even with the last minute cheap deals they tried to bribe me with at the end when i made it clear i never wanted anything to do with them the experience was so bad and i know its common for others that i truly believe that virgin media doesnt deserve to exist as a company i will applaud when it collapses under the stinking weight of its own and sinks into the sea never to be heard from again,Bad
184,after years with virgin media this company even doesnt deserve star i mean unstable internet connection no telephone customer services as waited hour and then try to chat with them online another hours as i was transferred to another department and eventually put back in a queue signing new contract and was rest assured price will not be increased but again every year increased comes on the name cpi investing in new networking wondering it should have an impact on better speed and reliable connection but no it has an adverse effect taking advantage of pandemic keeping low call center staff and there is no customer service and very aggressive marketing tactics say something and your bill tells completely different and if you say you want to leave you will be asked early disconnection fee they really trap you only interested in your money and call center agents will do anything to renew your contract and rest of things will come later bit by bit if you contest them simple answer you are bound by your contract trust me they are not bothered by whatever we write here the only hope is if someone finds this helpful and stays away from them shame on virgin media and mr branson,Bad
185,product ordered and i that there would be a delay as the website said this received an email the day we went on holiday to france saying that it would be delivered by parcel we were away on holiday i tried to change the delivery address with parcel force but that was impossible as a result parcel force tried to deliver the parcel to our address but we were away on holiday they did not contact a neighbour who would have accepted it curently i am trying to track where it is as the parcel force system say access await a response for the bt store and parcel force as to when it will be delivered to my neighbour,Bad

187,despite paying my bill on time since i took out a contract in an advisor randomly decided to allocate my bill payment for october as an ad hoc device plan payment when i went to pay my november bill they tried charging me double the advisor sorted this for me or so i thought he took my standard monthly payment and raised a good will gesture credit to show they i didnt owe anything else days later i received emails and an app notification to say that my bill is overdue i phoned them up again and the advisor who i thought could handle his job and left outstanding on my account this whole charade has resulted in defaults on my credit score to which o just basically shrugged and said nowt we can do all i have done is pay them what i owe when i owe it and their advisors are so incompetent theyve just allocated them wrong on my customer ledger on the th of december i asked to speak to a complaints team to seek a resolution an actual apology and some compensation for the damage to my score and the hours and calls id had to make by that time to try to resolve it fast forward to the th of december and after hearing nothing i called back and was told that the advisor had forgotten to put my case forward to the complaints team i told her i wanted to speak to them now and she said she would put me through of course the phone cut out and i had to go back through the automated system and start again the next advisor i spoke to literally told me that they think ive been mislead to get me off of the phone because there is no complaints team ive now also received another letters today to inform me i have until the th of december to pay arrears that never been with o for the last years and never had an issue but then again ive never had to deal with their cs teams who dont seem to be trained to deal with allocating cash to sales invoices,Bad
188,used live chat to request cancellation of broadband as the service i have been receiving since moving house has been appalling even though i was informed that my service would remain unchanged i have contacted talktalk on numerous occasions to try and resolve the situation however nothing has been done and my broadband is now worse than ever i was initially told that there was nothing wrong with my connection however after contacting them several times they agreed to upgrade my broadband to fibre optic at no extra cost due to the poor service this has not been done when contacting to cancel i was told i would have to pay a termination fee absolute cheek they have breached their contract by not providing the services they stated and they want me to pay was told i had to be transferred to the technical team who could waive the charges and cancel the contract technical team wanted to do some checks explained i had done the checks myself and that my download speed is mb lower than the average in my area and my upload speed is mb which is lower than the average in my area nothing has been moved or added to the broadband and i want to cancel as they have failed to provide me with an acceptable level of service they asked did i want them to do diagnostics explained nothing has been sorted in months how did i then want to proceed are you freaking kidding me i want to cancel my contract transferred through to the loyalty department told again i would need to pay a breakage fee explained i would not be paying this as i cannot use the services they are supposed to be providing me told i need to speak to the tech team ive already spoke to the tech team they transferred me to you the stupidity in this company is ridiculous explained that the minimum guaranteed speed stated in my contract is mb therefore they have breached their contract also stated in section you may immediately end your agreement if we break any important term of your agreement also in section a in relation to good and digital content that are faulty or not as iv a final right to reject by this point ive already been transferred departments again back to the technical everything again told need to do trouble shooting and wait days before i can cancel my account said if it is not resolved im not paying for those days weve clearly upset you you dont say i just want to cancel my freaking account anyway did all the technical issues as usual going to contact me in days to see whats going on so after hours it is not resolved all they have done is change some settings and ive got to wait days and if it is not resolved they will send an engineer out end of conversation do i still want to make a complaint what do you freaking story short dont use this provider they offer bad service and even poorer customer service if thats possible rest assured if the problem is not sorted i will cancel my account and if it is i will still be cancelling at the end of my contract steer clear,Bad

193,pointless waste of that an upgrade means a new sim card but this means an o sim card this means a new number which means i need a pac code and to contact o to get my number transferred also although the free new sim is included in the monthly payment you now have to pay gbp to o wait what so its not free then yes sir its included in your package but you have to pay the money directly to o which means a new direct debit and a new log in to o and another app on my such a laborious pointless waste of time for no benefit to me that i can see,Bad

195,talktalk is appalling the wifi is average at best with signal dropping off here and there the customer service however is another ball game entirely absolutely horrendous you spend multiple hours calling only to get through to somebody who doesnt speak or understand english if you can get through at all that is as they require a landline number from you which many people dont have once finally speaking to someone you are confronted with repetitive scripted responses often not relevent to your complaint eventually you end the call believing that the problem is resolved only to find that nothing has changed having to call back again and waste yet more time and money calling they dont call back when they say they are reluctant to pass you to a manager and when they do the manager is equally as poor due to poor service we requested to leave talktalk to be told that we simply cannot without incurring big charges but rest assured the manager offered us a whole off our bill on top of all of this the website is equally as bad we struggle every time to get into our account and view our bills as somehow talktalk have managed to link our address to an address i lived in many years ago which has now been disconnected honestly appalling service steer well clear,Bad

200,i signed months contract with talk talk thinking that i made a good broadband deal unfortunately after few months i recognised it was a terrible mistake the broadband is the slowest i have ever experienced i need to restart the router after downloads to speed up i decided to use my mobile data instead when i called in to cancel the contract the agent was pathetic and unhelpful it took up to hours to get through to the cancellation team i believe it is my first but also last contract with talk talk ever it is not worthy to save few pennies which actually turned out to cost you more when you contact talk talk to start a new contract it takes you less than a minute to get through and you will receive the best from the agent but at the moment you sign up the new contract you are trapped in the most doggy broadband provider and the worst customer service in uk i dont know why such company still exists avoid at all cost if you can,Bad

202,if i could give negative stars it would be if your thinking of moving to this company then dont i have a complaint that is unresolved in attempts with the inept customer service lie to you saying its fixed well if it is how come the same issue comes up times they dont let you complain by email as so you have a trail to take to ofcom or trading standards as they charge you for a service they are unable to supply i am not sure how they keep in business with this quality of service please dont help them stay conning more the post from talktalk after my initial review i will add that i have had contact with the email team over this complaint they give the same lies as the webchat say things are sorted and are dont help them stay conning more people,Bad

208,i dont often leave reviews company weve ever dealt with admitted themselves misleading charge unethical hidden fees ask to make a complaint about the issue and refuse you to do so not given a governing body either absolutely terrible for the record its not sustainable ripping people off,Bad
209,if i could have put stars i would when looking at the list of providers suitable for my business talk talk business came as one of them and as a known name i chose them over cheaper other providers never seems there was an issue with our postcode that initially meant we were unable to proceed with an order despite having fibre broadband already at the property when i looked into this further talk talk agreed to proceed and my order was placed frustratingly i was apparently not eligible for fibre as i was a new customer so we were going to have to go through a ridiculous process of starting on adsl with a router for day in order to qualify for broadband and a new router leaving the day old router not environmentally considerate at all i was assured this was the only way due to not having a gold key or some nonsense so agreed to this clunky system week on i have not received any confirmation email or a go live date so telephoned for an update to be told our order had been rejected due to the postcode issue no one from talk talk had been in touch to tell us this i would not have known without ringing their advice was to change all our details with current provider and then begin again placing the order as we were still in the cooling off period i went to another provider who very efficiently processed my order rectified the postcode issue in seconds and most refreshingly i spent minutes on hold waiting to be transferred to another department quite a contrast to talk i can help it i will never consider talk talk for either home or business broadband and i urge you to steer clear,Bad
210,for a whole week now virgin internet has been intermittent and drops for hours each day virgin deny any issues in the area n london and say its my hardware and book an engineer within the hour they send a text saying engineer booked on hold and we are trying to fix the issue then the engineer booked the next day same problem and the next and the next a whole week now with extremely poor and no internet i been informed now by my mobile phone provider that i have spent on calling virgin media extremely bad customer services extremely bad broadband provider i have been a loyal customer with virgin but when my contract ends i will seek a new provider and please virgin dont send me a bot generated response as that makes you look even there we go a bot reply from yes virgin your so called useful app and expensive recorded message all state no issues known yet your agent confirms existing issues in the area,Bad

213,i was with vodafone for years i had three phones under one account in my phone contracts on all three phones ended as i wanted to stay with vodafone but reduce my a month combined bills i contacted them and asked to go on sim only for all three a simple task you may well imagine but it wasnt after months of trying to sort things out with them to change to sim only i gave up and moved across to o as i was getting so depressed over the way i was being treated many at vodafone believed they had sorted the matter but alas not who would ever have though that having been with the same provider for as simple as changing to a monthly sim with them would force me to leave its obvious that they are after new business only,Bad
214,were in a tiny student flat and the range of the router provided by virgin barely covers the living room virgin offered us wifi extenders if we paid them an extra a month on top of the were already giving them we didnt get a choice in provider because virgin have a deal with our letting agent to promote their services and the flat only comes with a socket for their network so to get an socket for all other uk networks would require getting the landlords permission which is next to impossible even with spending a lot of our own money on powerlines and boosters the signal fluctuates heavily throughout the day and barely functions between this student flat and my parents ive dealt with talktalk sky bt vodafone and now virgin and virgin are by far the worst broadband provider ive ever dealt with if not the worst company ive had to deal with completely the stress of dealing with their network has made online learning work from home even more difficult,Bad

313,the number of times you have to repeat the same information to different people when there is an issue is absolutely disgraceful i was led to believe by talktalk before i signed up that they had uk technical support this does not appear to be the case when i had mb fibre broadband in april i had mb coming in and about mb via wifi in all rooms now i have the same coming in with bt but as little as zero via wifi in one bedroom and only mb feet away from the router in the same room with a direct line of sight from the router to the ipad the only thing that has changed is the router they have offered to send an engineer but i must accept that when they come if they find any issue with my setup or the router is working within acceptable limits at that point in time then i must pay given that over days i have spent hours on the phone to them dismantling phone sockets for them and even tolerating them losing my broadband completely i cannot trust them and so cannot accept the likelihood of a bill they will not supply a router which has been recommended by them to fix the problem unless the engineer brings with the risk of a bill when my contract expires that will be it for good never again will i use talktalk and nor will my family,Bad

326,talktalk have been the worst company i have ever dealt with over the almost years i have been with talktalk i have had set up a however for an unknown reason it did not work so every month talktalk would issue a late payment fee so every month i would have to ring them pay my bill and ask why the wasnt taken and they didnt know in their defence every time they credited me the late payment fee back and set up the again this continued for to months each month having to go through the various pains of contacting them paying over the phone and resetting up a eventually moving the date seemed to solve the issue fibre had a call from a rd party engineer about a year into my contract that was about to expire stating he was on his way to upgrade my line it was the first i heard of it and believed it was a mistake as my contract was running out i was going to review my broadband provider anyway the engineer said he was going to speak to talktalk and that was the last time i spoke to someone on the phone about the issue i received an email an array of confusing text messages and no upgrade talktalk did give me months worth of credit without me complaining which was very welcome but at the end of the months i still had not received the fibre broadband upgrade but was now being charged a fibre broadband rate at this point my house was on the market so i did not call them as i was intending to cancel soon anyway taking me onto issue called talktalk to arrange cancellation however their system was down they put a note on the file about the date i called and asked me to call back the next day i called back days later the system was still down so asked me to call back next week that takes us to today as far as i am concerned i had met my obligations to call them to cancel so my call to them was just a courtesy call however they then told me i had to agree to cancellation terms and conditions or i could not cancel the real sticking point for me being the new terms included a fee if the equipment was not returned i intend to return the equipment but anything could happen i did not agree so they told me i could not cancel i told them i already had they said they couldnt process it well to save a headache i agreed under duress they refused to accept my agreement under duress and said i must simply agree ironically adding duress and i wish i had caved at this point but i didnt so was transferred to customer services customer services couldnt really help with the issue they arranged for the returns envelope to be sent to me then transferred me to a cancellation team who essentially said they needed me to agree to the cancellation terms and conditions even without challenging my assertion that it constituted a penalty and was not binding in contract law it had been minutes at this point and departments so i said okay the call ended with me thinking i had cancelled but no i had a call back within a few minutes to read me the terms and conditions again because they had not been read out to me after i had been transferred between departments they read them out and i said okay at this point we are at nearly an hour for what started as a courtesy call to them ultimately this company is using their weight to apply terms that are not legally binding and will just transfer you between departments until you cave to them or keep charging you a fee for a service you dont actually receive ps had only a few issues with the broadband the speed has been fine and have had the occasional drop out but it is rare,Bad

331,so my problem with bt is probably not as serious as others but it is very worrying i think i receive their fibre broadband which isnt fibre because nobody has dug up my garden to replace the wires yet and my anticipated download speed is mb or there abouts its nowhere near proper fibre so misleading which leads to my issue my guaranteed download speed is mb and i pay them for that but my actual download speed according to their own speed app is mb now you could argue my broadband is still working and i am getting a reasonable speed to be able to do a lot of things so whats the problem well the problem is i am paying for a service which i am not receiving a service which they in their own words guarantee and it got me thinking how many people out there are paying extra for these guaranteed speed and not receiving close to it my guess is quite a lot i tried registering this as an issue hilariously then received a text message saying how did we do when nothing had been done oh except may be other than moving my case to their recycle bin,Bad
332,they activate your tariff before your sim gets delivered essentially being charged before i even use their services what is worse is that my order has not been delivered it has been days now and im having to arrange for a new delivery with o so it could be over weeks from when i ordered to when i actually get my delivery and im being charged for this pathetic company,Bad
333,i changed my internet and phone from sky to bt and i can honestly say the financial saving was not worth the hassle they had technical issues setting up my line so they cancelled my order without telling me company put the onus on you to chase your order if there are any issues and when their help lines are so busy it takes mins to speak to anyone at the best of times it is very frustrating i also got cut off mid call to bt had advisers give me a date to call back and not bother and generally went round in circles while i tried to get my internet set up did get offered compensation though so the daily phone calls accumulating hours on the phone to them were well worth it think carefully about joining bt,Bad
334,false advertising very bad service ordered upgrades one was for my elderly mother whos phone stopped working and now had no communication method vodafone was offering day delivery due to order delays ok not as fast as normal but time of year ordered first weeks ago later no phones or update are blaming dpd for not collecting their orders no vodafone has choice to use dpd so this is fault despite huge backlogs they are still accepting new orders promising day delivery which they have no intention of meeting very bad customer service and false advertising if no phone shortly will be referring to trading standards and ofcom as this is just lying to customers,Bad
335,the update of my virgin media review is as follows after the ombudsman found in my favour i chose to stay with virgin as they said they would now look at my problem in more depth an engineer came out and said he didnt know how we managed to get a connection at all as it was evident that the underground cable was damaged they came out and laid a new cable and bingo the speed jumped to what is was supposed to be its not always perfect but generally i am seeing around mbps on average its still a bit poor for a mbps connection but almost acceptable i contacted virgin and pointed out that my original complaint goes back yrs mth i have paid my monthly fee diligently for an entire yr contract and then for mths of my new contract even when i was cancelling online lessons during lockdown i am a teacher or having to go next door to use their sky connection to give evidence during an online court case i still kept up to date with payments i was told by different customer service representatives that i would be due some compensation for my horrendous experience i have emailed written letters including to their ceo used the online web chat telephoned customer services on several occasions i have received no replies to my requests for compensation i even pointed out that i was only after compensation for my latest contract which spans mths and am yet to receive any reply they say they will reply within days but mths would be more appropriate i have since contacted them to cancel the contract altogether as a matter of principle but they wont even acknowledge my cancellation request i have had no choice but to direct debit hoping that none payment would prompt response all they have done is restricted my connection so i now have no internet and they now constantly bombard me with requests for payment from an email address and text number that does not accept read this week that virgin are at the bottom of the league for complaints and customer satisfaction virgin are all about the money since branson sold up customer service wise they have gone down the toilet i am awaiting the next stage which will no doubt be passing my bill to a debt collection agency i await my day in court if your reading this thinking shall i get a virgin account then take the advice of someone who has been stung by both virgin media and virgin mobile they are virgin on the ridiculous stay well clear,Bad

337,terrible evil cancelled my account years ago they kept taking the money when i tried to ask them to close the account they refused so i cancelled my direct debit and asked them again they refused to allow me to close the account again as i was now in debt to them for a service i hadnt used for years they reduced my credit score and referred me to a debt collection agency i was forced to pay more money just to get away from them they told me it took days for the money to clear with them even though i paid by debit card on line and by that time they had done it again and again tried to take money and again refused to close the account this has all been going on for a while now so i complained to the ombudsman and they are still dealing with all other review here show have nothing to do with vodafone ever as i keep meeting people treated this badly and more they run the risk of driving to vulnerable people to suicide how can they get away with this again and again and again,Bad
338,was quoted for my phone which was in pristine condition not a scratch on it working perfectly sent the phone off and got a revised quote of they stated that the phone was not in the condition i had advised and that the buttons and touchscreen were not working you arent able to speak to anyone so have to communicate via message which is not very convenient and they dont answer quickly i asked them to send my phone back received phone back and sent to who quoted me slightly less but they paid me into my bank account the same day gaff are obviously dishonest and i will never use them again,Bad

413,dont trust them even one word,Bad
414,i have given star because i couldnt give i entered into the bt contract on rd july but the internet was not connected until th august i am now moving to another provider the reason for deciding to cancel the contract is because even though speed tests show on average mb per second into my property my download speed never reaches above kb per second and that is with an ethernet cable straight from the bt hub to my laptop which is a distance of meters and with wifi is exactly the same and also the internet hangs at all times of the day and situation has upset me greatly i am a disabled pensioner and bt didnt even send an engineer to the property because they say there is no fault but a fault is not the problem the problem is i have never even received the minimum speed i signed up asking a bt telephone representative if buying a higher package would resolve the situation my son was informed that it looked like my property would never reach the approximate minimum speed of mb per second the representative asked my son if he could close the fault and my son said no because it wasnt his account and he would have to phone or email myself before closing this did not happen bt just closed the am now being told i owe bt for coming out of the contract but i have never had the speed i signed up for false advertising bt are signed up to voluntary code of practice on broadband speeds and customers can leave contract without penalty if minimum guaranteed speeds are not reached i have contacted ofcom and await a is not the way to treat people,Bad

422,months ago i purchased a mobile phone from carphone warehouse i received the phone and returned the phone within the maximum alloted time as it was not of the quality that i am accustomed to months later i received a debt collection letter saying that i owed vodafone pound and was in breach of contacted the debt collection agency and said i had no contract with the firm and what on earth was this about they confirmed that they believed i had not returned the phone and was in breach of contacted vodafone and they said that they had received the phone but that my contract has an outstanding balance of pounds i explained that i had not activated the phone and returned the phone and not accepted the contract they had said that i had not cancelled in time even though the phone was returned in time and as i had cancelled my direct debit they reported me to a debt collection agency to retrieve the asked them to cancel the contract before i reported them to the ombudsman they said they would only do so if i paid a certain amount of money i refused and then instead suggested i pay a lesser amount of pound which i paid to make them go away i made it clear that this would be the last money they would ever get off me and that they should never contact me ever again i was assured by the manager that this would not impact my credit rating and i hung up and got back to my i was my property and found that i couldnt get the mortgage provider i that time i was also in a rush to find a new mortgage as i was rolling over into the default payment period which was significantly higher than normal mortgage had spent a number of nights attempting to find a mortgage provider but was not being accepted by anybody i finally gave up and went back to my original mortgage provider and accepted the terms that they i was messing about with a decision in principle tool for a personal loan as i happen to work in the business these tools dont impact your credit rating and i thought id just use my own details for test purposes i was refused for a very small loan and i was baffled as to how this was interest was peaked and i signed up to up to a credit file checking service to understand why my rating was so credit check came back with a low score which was linked to a single defaulted account of had added a defaulted account to my credit report and not removed it even after i paid off the account which i had never even signed up impacted my ability to remortgage my property and also to get a credit never contacted me once prior to targeting me in this vicious i will never buy another service or product off you ever again and will never recommend you to another friend neighbour or colleague again i can assure you that this bad will is going to cost you more than the you squeezed out of for the worst customer experience of my lifei will use this experience as an example of how not operate in business when talking to and colleagues and ensure that behaviour like this is stamped if your think this is an isolated instance and not behaviour driven from aggressive money making senior management tactics think again check out articles about vodafone in this is money the sun and which to mention just a few they have also been amongst the most heavily fined of all the telcos this year with consistent serious breaches of customer your self a favour and avoid this company until they get their act this review was recently flagged and removed as it appeared to violate some rules on trust pilot site so ive updated with additional detail on what actually happened and reposted ive not been given an explanation as to why this is by trustpilot which suggests something may be not right with policies and procedures i understand that companies have the right to defend themselves but in this case why not post vodafone response here rather than letting them hide behind your rules and let them cherry pick the bad reviews that people can see,Bad

434,recently i have ordered two new iphones through o it is easy to use the online system although the amount of forms to complete is quite onerous but probably necessary on both orders at the end they have given me a delivery date one of which i chose the option to pay extra to have at a more convenient time than some time between am and pm on both delivery dates i waited in all day and nothing was delivered the following day i contacted o via their web chat only to be told that the item was out of stock they could not give me a new delivery date as they clearly had no idea when that would be the staff seemed very used to this situation and i now am beginning to realise that this must happen all the time i cannot believe that in this day and age o cannot run a service that gives customers accurate delivery dates and in the case of a delivery not being made that they take the time and trouble to inform the customer this to me is an absolute minimum requirement when running a large delivery organisation,Bad

442,was offered upgrade via email and text due to existing contract expiring shortly failed due to billing issues and due to their intransigence and stubborn refusal to assist on multiple occasions in the past with a billing issue meant my credit score has been harmed as a result of their actions despite me paying my account in full over the last years or so and vodafone are not taking responsibility and are refusing to assist are flatly refusing to engage and the new contract and handset i wanted to move onto would actually be cheaper than my existing will be raising a formal complaint with ofcom and the fsa and requesting a full set of communication and account records they hold under a foi request as a result as this is solely down to their conduct as a company,Bad

455,if i could give a minus score that is what i would do my contract is due to end on june i called about weeks ago to confirm cancellation i spent about hours on the phone only to be told it had to be days notice otherwise i would be charged an early cancellation fee i contacted them days in advance and spent a further hours confirming i did not wish to continue with the same service for twice the amount honestly i would rather have my toenails pulled out by the gestapo than deal with this mob yesterday they called me and offered me a cheaper deal and today i received an email to similar effect go away virgin you have screwed me over for too long and i am now going elsewhere for a similar service at a fraction of the cost,Bad
456,loyal customer of many many years but being loyal to a company means nothing a new customer would pay a month less than i do for staying with virgin manager claimed to me there broadband was look at my account history show its fact its dreadful in our area they broke my broadband box there was a fault in our area but they said there wasnt they told me to do some them checks the router went they recognised there was an area a box would be sent out within hours only for days later still hadnt been sent out thats just one of numerous similar issues over the years and they still charge you more for being loyal and putting up with there s,Bad
457,it has been one instance of arrogance bullying incompetence and harassment from virgin media since the day i took out a contract with them firstly without the courtesy of an explanation the delivery date for the hardware was changed to a few days later this was after them writing to me and instructing me to be available on the original delivery date to receive such hardware do these people not realise that customers also have jobs lives and commitments and it went on and on from there in october this year i ended the contract and went to a new provider several weeks later i received a letter from mark davidson in customer services asking for a sum just short of by way of the final bill no bill had been sent and no breakdown of the sum i was on a monthly contract rate of just above so i asked for an bill as required by law he ignored this another identical letter arrived from mr davidson and i responded in the same way again he ignored this next i started to received harassing and aggressive calls from people from bpo demanding payment i emailed virgin medias ceo tom asking for bpo to be called off an bill and no adverse entries on my credit record apparently mr is too grand to respond to correspondence but instead put this in the hands of his team who proceeded to harass me with constant phone calls at least three being at am this morning even after i asked for them to stop harassing me and to communicate in writing moreover the team always wanted me to respond to them on a high rate telephone line i did eventually receive two bills from virgin media one with one without for the same period but for different amounts and despite repeated requests virgin media failed to explain why they had done this utter arrogant incompetence today at last they have clarified which amount as shown in the bill amount but in the same email say they have placed the matter in the hands of outside debt collectors because the bill is overdue ah hmm no i have only just found out which is the amount they think is due still require an bill still not provided for the bill they want me to pay still require assurance about my credit record and by law am entitled to a reasonable time to consider and pay the bill thus as you can see the arrogant bullying and harassment continues update paid the bill in full over four weeks ago sent directly to mark davidson head of virgin media customer care they havent acknowledged it or presented it for payment and i am still be threatened by their debt collectors no one will listen to me at virgin media when i try to explain that i have paid numerous emails to the ceo tom go unacknowledged i asked for a deadlock letter so i can take this to mediation but these have been ignored chauhan virgin media ceo national account manager presents a veneer of pretending to be helpful but all he has done is try to bully me to pay i have paid it is virgin medias that they havent processed my payment and he has told me in an email that my credit record will be adversely affected i have done nothing wrong so virgin media are simply vindictive bullies this is criminal activity,Bad
458,absolutely awful virgin upgraded my business broadband speed on monday and since then weve had no internet ive made countless calls to the business fault line and heard excuse after excuse had to restart my router oh your router isnt registered with us they installed it hard reset outage in the area i was promised a call back and an engineer today nothing now several calls later im told the upgrade was and the router mac code isnt associated with my account so they need to do an account rebuild which will take at least days apparently they cant put me back to the original line speed either,Bad

463,ive used for a few years where i need connectivity on a device and dont want a further contract so when my nearly year old mother needed a new sim card i added a card so during lock down they blocked my mothers sim they sent a message apparently which she doesnt know how to read giving her a month to use the phone she has it on all the time i wrote to and got the normal political correctness and was unable to identify the phone correctly or something so they wouldnt turn it back on i then wrote a polite email to ash schofield the managing director no reply so are in my view hopeless and show no concern for the elderly and vulnerable in these difficult times and it got worse i eventually got a response from from the same person who delay with my original complaint rather than the managing director asking me the same questions this is a shameful company who simply couldnt care less about individual users,Bad
464,i cancelled a number transfer after a text from tescos explaining that i would lose my credit of i cancelled within ten minutes received a email to say it had by stopped from the next day at they went ahead with the transfer i lost the service of two phones for hrs my all could say was sorry no offer of a goody bag or some reimbursement just sorry awful company to deal with childish very unprofessional,Bad

467,i gleefully had entered contract with them based on feedback from previous tenant and a pound referral discount the horrendous journey ensued from the installation date being pushed back by them to the discourteous installation engineer who at least was honest enough to mention that sky tv is far better than what virgin tv the engineer left without explaining the virgin user interface has been fine and has caused no problems in the year we have been using it attempted to make an amendment for our package and was informed by the call centre that by doing that we would be automatically transferred to a new contract that would lock us in it for another centre staff is heaving accented and none of the ones i have spoken to for the times i have called them in past year have sounded helpful or upon termination they expect you to send the equipment back in a prepaid box that they send i had been with sky for past years and cannot recommend it strongly enough virgin entertainment is an oxymoron,Bad
468,shocking services never go with them and i will never again go with them you have lost a young life time customer because of your shocking service and thieving ways problem got fibre to our property was a significant charge which was fair enough as the property didnt previously have fibre however the new bt hub was utterly useless kept freezing cutting out and resetting constantly when connected to or more devices we logged the problem times with bt in several different mediums over a month period this was stressful and as my job relied on internet the only attempt to fix the problem was that they sent us of the same hubs which did not fix the problem and left more and more effort for us to set up and sort out eventually i bought my own router which solved the problem and bt offered only month of compensation for this even though the router cost us over months worth it was ridiculous still we have issues with internet cutting out etc i reported these but never got much response appalling problem we were promised around in vouchers for setting up an account i logged on and attempted to claim these for months even rang up twice about them until one day i was told we didnt claim in the adequate amount of time so not only were we denied the offer of this deal and this was the main reason that made them slightly cheaper than other providers without this they became expensive and in dealing with the above two problems staff have been rude and incredibly unhelpful they have incompetent software engineers clearly as the hub has serious code flaws when connecting devices and some services on it were still under maintenance and being updated shocking similarly i had to speak to often foreign call centres and with staff who cant even spell graduate problem when setting up my tariff i asked for it to be back dated so that it would be finished for when our tenancy ended however now i have been told that we will be incurring another disconnection charge for leaving regardless even though only last week id been told that if the future tenants had taken up our line we wouldnt be charged turns out that was rubbish and i was lied too i am so frustrated tired from dealing with the problems and fed up with the last years services and i doubt this review will get any response from bt however with any luck it will stop people making the same mistake i did all in all i shall be going anywhere else for my next property they were far better and ultimately cheaper taking into account all the hidden sneaky charges bt dont highlight when you enter into a deal with them by bt i shall not miss you yours sincerely angry fed up customer,Bad
469,this company is great if you want to be disappointed the most you have ever been disappointed in your life they do not honour their contracts when asked to forward the contract they emailed me they denied it existed on their end and they could not access my account despite being able to do it in a previous call ee is a terrible company for anybody anywhere,Bad

483,shocking experience with a customer for several years both mobile phoned and home broadband for a period and for the most part wss a pleasent experience that is until you need to contact customer had active mobile phone pay monthly plans with one of them a couple months from ending so i called up customer service to enquire early upgrade costs and cancelation costs as i had found a deal with a competitor after asking ee if they could match the deal with an upgrade they couldnt and for the price i was paying per month versus the cancelation charge quoted in the long run i would be better offi was quoted to cancel the plan for that mobile phone which i agreed with the service agent during the call he then sent me through to retention so they could work out a deal and try to keep my custom and this is where the problems went through their and they couldnt beat ot match or even come close to the competitor so i agreed again with the price by the first advisor and requested the line be cancelled and could switch over without problem whilst still having line with ee minutes after ending the call both phones on my account recieved cancelation texts confirming they had been cancelled this a charge on the original line quoted at coming in at and the second line coming in at we then tried to call back customer service and sat on hold for around minutes as it was apparently busy i couldnt wait on hold any longer so had to hang this point i emailed ee and fully highlighted the situation after a day or so the complaints team got back to me and this woman absolutely did not want to be doing her job and was a professional at lying through her spoke with her and went over the past few days situation and she announced to me that the charges sent to us where correct so i asked if all calls where recorded and she told me they where so i explained that the first customer service agent quoted me for the original cancelation she agreed to go listen to the next day she called me back and stated that the call did not exist and she could find no recording i told her the exact minute i made the call and the time i was on the call making it easy for her to find she still claimed it did not exist but said the call to was able to be found on the system despite the calls being single call the orignal agent us and the complaints agent there was back and forth over how kuch we should pay and we explained that we had bought new phones with the competitor as we could not be without active service due to have an extremely ill baby and we stated we would pay any cancelation fees but that the quoted on the initial cancelation was what we agreed and we would not pay a penny more as it was confirmed to usthe complaints agent with her attitude says it wouldnt happen and i requested a letter of deadlock so i could take it up with the ombudsman she stated the letter would arrive in days weeks later we still have not recieved the letter and have sent an email requesting this deadlock letter and also made a subject access request for all data held on my account so they now legally have an obligation to follow through with my within days but several days after this request still zero reply from ee,Bad
484,absolutely bloody useless all i wanted to do was cancel my switch to them and lost the entire bloody morning on online chats and phone calls,Bad
485,id give zero if i could signed up for broadband that keeps cutting out i was told that i could cancel without fees as the problem was not fixed only to be told by cancellations that the case had been closed and marked as solved ongoing issues with broadband got through to call centre on a saturday started speaking to someone who put the phone down as soon as their shift was finished engineer came couldnt fix my problem i was assured before he came that there would be no charge unless my equipment was damaged charged anyway called for refund and after holding told id be refunded they then put me through to tech who said they didnt say that and wanted to pull the original phonecall and get back to me about the charge the worst service ive experienced im looking to complain to the financial ombudsman as i cant stand this anymore theres no communication between departments and they just want to fob you off ive never had issues with any of my providers but lesson learned with this one contract up in february so hopefully when i change providers i might actually be able to watch a film all the way through on netflix without the thing cutting out the amount of stress this company has caused me is unreal not to mention taking more money on my dd than was agreed to add just started a live chat to complain and the agent said give me minutes to look into this never came back to the chat i was unable to write anything,Bad
486,dont touch this company they have a fully automated computer system which means they neither want to talk with you or care about your only reason i have had communication from them is to sign up me up as a customer,Bad
487,my son got a contract seemed good deal really low monthly cost yet almost every month a few days after the bill was paid he got outgoing calls barred as he was over his credit cap no joy from carphone warehouse my guess is that he was going over his and was getting hit by excessive charges he only ever used data for fb and twitter and not for downloading music or vids when he was at work he used wifi should be avoided at all costs hes recently switched to payg will be interesting to see his data useage now in realtime,Bad
488,absolutely appalling communication i was supposed to have my broadband installed but received a text saying that there was a problem and that i would be updated i contacted the chat and was told to ignore the text and that there wasnt a problem and that the visit was still booked i contacted them again a few days later saying i had not received the equipment nor the email i was again reassured that it will arrive or it will come with the engineer they werent sure and i will receive the day no engineer i was passed around on the phone and ended up having to end the call as i was just put on hold for over minutes the hr chat is not hrs as the department i needed was closed the next day i was told on chat that there was a problem and i had to ring sales to confirm information and book a date for installation all this was not told to me before the customer service kept repeating the same information and tried to pass me trying to make a complaint i was passed along from one person to another wasting my time and still with no broadband in sight i had already waited two weeks for this supposed installation date to be only told afterwards i need to rebook it to cancel i was constantly passed from one person to another what a bad experience i have had with them and such a waste of time,Bad
489,ive had next to no service for nearly months i always drop calls i used my phone for work and get less than mbps data speed and drive for a living so the maps app is somewhat important ive offered to send the phone back to write off the contract and call it there and after nearly months of emailing back and further ive been told that there is no issue in my area even tho my data doesnt work and im aware of at least other people with the same issue and ive been offered a month off which i dont want to be ungrateful about but at the same time a month off a phone i cant even use isnt great,Bad
490,first engineer comes out to set up wifi in my new flat says theres a fault on the line and someone else will be out today if he has time this was around lunchtime second guy turns up does some work on the line and says thats me away give it minutes and itll be on i ask him knowing in my bones that it wouldnt work if there is a number i can contact him on if it doesnt work no it will work just give it an hour later when it isnt working i call customer services nice guy on the not his fault at all but tells me just leave it to midnight and i am certain it will be working guess who wasnt certain me guess what wasnt working my internet call up the next day to report same guy on the phone he says the line needs more work done we can get someone out to you on december th i ordered this on the got it installed on and now it wont be working until im working from home this is absolutely and utterly unacceptable told ill be compensated per day that there is a delay in service so that i can add more data to my phone so i can work from home wish i didnt take take a risk and go with vodafone never again will cancel if im able to stay with your customer until the internet is working to make sure youve done your job ridiculous,Bad
491,i bought a wifi extender direct from the bt shop as i have poor wifi reception in one part of my house the extender worked fine for weeks then stopped working after rebooting and trying all the other troubleshooting tips i contacted bt shop and asked if they would replace the faulty item bt shop said i needed to speak to the service helpline and get a fault reference number before it could be replaced they out me through to the service helpline and i waited mins to be told sorry i only deal with phones on this number they gave me a number for a dedicated helpline which i rang two and a half hours later my battery ran out on the phone without the call being gave upi emailed bt complaints dept and got an acknowledgement saying they would respond in hours that was over a week ago and still no think bt make it deliberately impossible for anyone to complain about faulty goods i for one will never buy from them again and will never recommend them to as requested by shop order no dual band wifi ref no further helpline was answered after only mins reference obtained and item posted to freepost address lets see if the new one will how bt suddenly wanted to help after this review was published p,Bad
492,years in and ever increasing call packages final nail in the coffin quoted to upgrade but billed and nobody willing to do anything about it,Bad
493,my home phone hasnt worked for almost the whole of this year five engineer visits hours and hours on the phone to probably the worst call centre in the world text chats where they seem to deliberately make you suffer by telling you hold fire were getting you connected minutes later and then claim you left the they still charge me line rental and have given me but two days of compensation in three months help,Bad
494,absolutely crap having landline issues for the past hours advisor said that they can send an engineer out but if it turns out its not their fault then we will be charged round of applause to this company whoever has set these terms and condition well done to you advisors have no idea what theyre saying information is not clear spoke to another advisor after that and she said she will ring back to confirm security with me never did waited minutes customer service advisors there have targets for call backs so they wont call back as it will affect their stats paying for a service that i am not clearly getting rang again advisor has taken me through troubleshooting at pm she cut off as at pm lines were closing i do not recommend this service and never will absolutely these automatic replies do nothing dont even bother been a customer for the past years never had this advisors need more training clearly they need to listen more and not just selective listening to understand a customer and of course not to promise a customer they will ring back id rather be with no internet than with them trying to cancel the contract now,Bad
495,just a brief update on my last review now they deny even having taken any money so i guess the bank can pursue this for fraud and theft,Bad
496,absolutely awful i mean absolutely disgusting and bt for my business they deliver the equipment install date and no one turns up it turns out they cancelled we had to call them to find out there was no reason for them to cancel they then say they will expedite the installation and call us back that day no call came and we called them back times this happened and we always had to call them even though they promised multiple times to call back the internet is currently weeks days late and now they are saying they wont expedite it i would like to think this would only happen once but i have seen this multiple times they are good at apologising on the phone but they clearly have issues internally anyway we have just cancelled and are now going with another provider that is cheaper well done bt you are terrible but good at marketing,Bad
497,unacceptable unreasonable and rude service do not recommend to anyone my parents have been customers for years and throughout this the service has been crap anyone looking to get broadband or any service do not get virgin you will instantly regret we pay well over the odds and do not get what we pay for it has gone that far i will be reporting it to financial ombudsman as i know customers services do not do anything,Bad
498,bt is a disgrace my wife has changed her name and bt customer services told us to change the name on the bill we have to start a new contract pay cancellation fee of this cant be right they are profiting out of someone being transgender,Bad
499,i have been with for nearly a year i have called to complain about the connection and the speed and i managed to speak to more than agents or helpline customer services and most of them were rude and they hang up the phone and i have a recording phone calls to prove that i have sent a copy to the head office recently i will terminate this awful contract and ill never recommend you to anyone its a shame that had to end that way but i really had enough,Bad
