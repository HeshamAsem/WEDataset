28,absolutely rubbish company after years of poor service questions about the account resulting in a negative impact on the credit file even though it had nothing to do with it the hacks because they failed to secure peoples data so now that is forever causing issues the delusional belief that being told to end the contract at the end of its fixed term simply means denying it was ever said because they didnt keep a record and then billing for months and demanding another months notice when they were not even physically connected to the property now a final insult because they have filed a negative status on the credit file for none payment of a debt that should never have existed if they had complied with my legally binding instruction and for which i have never been sent a final bill they have the address but it is easier to make trash customers suffer for not worshipping the mighty people are fraudsters and if you are with them and are at the end of your contract i suggest you get your solicitor to send the termination notice otherwise they will just deny any knowledge of you telling advice avoiding like the plague they do not care about reviews not customers there are lots more companies that are better and none reply on here says everything they concern about what they did and now my credit file has dropped more than because i only paid them for two months after they cancelled the broadband but refused to do soi have complained and even though the account was paid as soon as i found out and they said it wouldnt affect my credit file because it has been paid in full a few days later they have told the credit reference company that i am four months in i am supposed to check an account that they should have month i am certain that i will be in default because they just keep for the sake of that was paid but the amount of damage they have caused to our lives over the years showing total contempt is absolutely despicable,Bad,1.0

160,i have been a customer for almost years through the various takeovers and during that time ive had my fair share of unpleasant experiences with their customer service folk but in my area the alternative broadband options are sketchy at best hence my sticking with them all this time its entirely the luck of the draw how your customer service experience is going to be will i get a fellow human being with a basic modicum of empathy or a thickly accented script follower who treats me and the issue im calling about with barely concealed contempt it seems basil fawlty trained the majority of their customer service agents though if youre lucky you might get stonewalled by a sybil type bored disengaged fatuous vacuous that profit and they cant put together a consistent approach that isnt entirely script driven pathetic really but thats what happens when most of your agents are offshore i guess again thats another little lottery they like you to play they periodically upgrade our line speed but there seems to be a curious inverse in quality of service i receive so i cant say this has ever made me feel like im receiving a quality service rather than one thats appear to strongly favour new customers over long standing ones and it doesnt matter how solid you are as a paying customer if they mess up your billing and youre not on top of it well good luck trying to get them to fess up they never admit liability such a shabby way to treat long standing customers my contract is up in march and theres not a damned thing their retention dept can do to retain me as a customer not this time ill take the hit of having to start anew i wont expect better from whoever receives my business but i will very likely be able to pay less to be treated with at worst equal contempt they can promise me the moon on a stick and ill still tell them where they can poke it new potential customers dont be fooled by the slick marketing usain bolt is the only good thing about them youre dealing with a company that definitely will fail to deliver on their promise probably just as youre lulled into a false sense of security about the service youre receiving at some point it will go south for you you will have to contend with their byzantine front end and it really does seem entirely designed to put you off their trail dont ever expect them to admit liability but do expect to be made to feel theyre doing you a favour every time they resolve an issue thats very likely of their own making and get used to being either or to by an offshore with no vested interest in your customer experience if you still insist on giving these utter charlatans your money be prepared to fight dirty because they do,Bad,1.0
161,after hours on the phone to at least six different people in the philippines or somewhere i have got nowhere i am simply trying to change my contract from virgin to o but have found it completely impossible to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing one man actually admitted that the merger of virgin and o is causing problems after finally having been promised a contract at a specific price i was then told at the last moment that i couldnt have the price after all i have given up and will never have anything to do with this company again,Bad,1.0
162,if you are thinking of using virgin media trust me you will live to regret it they hiked our internet prices up to an extortionate amount just cancel the contract i hear you say the problem is you cant cancel the contract firstly they inform you of the price after the termination date has passed so youve already been scammed into paying for at least one month secondly virgin customer service is beyond disgusting they make it impossible to contact them you cant email them and trying to speak to someone on the phone will cost you over in charges and they will not do what you said anyway we have spent months and over on calls telling them to cancel our service but each month they take nearly from our account ofcom needs to close these now,Bad,1.0

193,we secured a good deal with virgin media for broadband in as soon as our contract ended june they hiked our prices up by almost i called to explain that it was unaffordable id also been made redundant and financially we were struggling the rep at virgin was completely uninterested and offered a take it or leave amount that still resembled an increase on our original therefore chose to switch service providers which we did then called virgin to cancel and they made it as difficult as humanly possible to do this the women in the cancellations department actually argued that it was our fault for not being more proactive in reviewing our contract pricing another sign we had made the right choice by then received multiple calls each day over a week from virgin sales reps offering prices better than our original package been shy on sales targets but nowhere to be seen when i reached out obviously by this point were already with a new provider so it wasnt possible they then issued an outstanding payment notice claiming we had to give days notice to cancel and slapped a late payment fee on top of the value of the unjustifiably hiked tariff despite being out of is the corporate equivalent of bullying virgin see us as consumers not people numbers not individuals the value of the outstanding amount means nothing to virgin media but might mean something to an individual do they care absolutely not they are only interested in your pockets so just be wary if you go with them my advice would be not to following whats been a pretty inhumane and disgraceful experience judging by their score here its pretty consistent too too busy building rockets what a weeks threatening letters and emails from the customer support team at to the response here theyre sorry pr empathy but in real life theyve failed to action any kind of dialogue or tangible support more of the corporate bullying weve come to expect from virgin and their poor attitudes towards little back at the deal they offered versus the current reality this is really nothing more than financial virgin,Bad,1.0

226,this company is a joke just look at the reviews here wish i been with tesco mobile for years and to be honest thought they were great most especially for the fact that you got to speak to real friendly and helpful people from the start of a call but what have they personal gripe is the menu you now get when phoning in i have been trying and trying to address a small problem i have there is no option on the menu covering this so in the end i was forced into using live chat who just wandered off in and never came then having finally found an email address for customer service i wrote explaining the problem with the phone menus and the fact that for me they led nowhere got an email back ring those same doubt this review will elicit a nice friendly reply from tesco mobile as have all the others helping me not a jot and there it will end theyve got my money and so for them its job done,Bad,1.0

230,this is complex initial order of an advanced phone led to my receiving what is now an essential phone for digital voice according to current web information eg the video on the dv part of the website but in an advanced phone box i then ordered another advanced phone but this now comes with alexa so i inadvertently ordered something i didnt want i immediately called back and the order was cancelled too late i now have an advanced phone with alexa and an essential phone which was at the time i ordered it an advanced phone that was the label on the box so they arent the same the says you should use identical phones although i guess that means dont mix voip phone manufacturers i am warned to expect a message to return something as it was cancelled but nothing happening i am waiting and if i hear nothing will just use the current phone with alexa not engaged which will i hope give me the same functionality as the original advanced phone now an essential phone the website is just confusing the shop even less helpful in many ways both phone operatives i spoke to were excellent its the way bt has supplied a mix of models and changed the labels in the context of the digital voice rollout that has been the problem,Bad,1.0
231,we have been customers of talktalk for years last month the day after paying my monthly bill my internet connection was lost we went through all the trouble shooting tactics to get the connection back which included line and speed test disconnecting and reconnecting and factory reset when all these options failed i used the chat online option on the talktalk app i realised quickly this option was a robot and not a person the options suggested were all the options already tried and failed i was then connected to a person to message this person told me that our line had an active fault that was being worked app status also showed an active hours of the problem not being rectified i called talktalk i was put through to some one who wasnt easy to converse with all questions asked were clearly being asked from a script she again suggested i tried unplugging the router and reconnecting after again going through all these options line test speed test she said there was no issue i explained that our router still had no connection she then told us the only option would be to send out an engineer at a charge i explained i would not be paying the charge as whatever this fault was it certainly was not caused by us her response was you probably wont have to pay it i explained that i would absolutely not be taking that chance i explained the router has remained in the same position and is not something that is messed around with after minutes on the phone being put on hold multiple times and after her speaking with her manager i asked her can you assure me that if the engineer comes to have a look at the router i wont be charged she hung up the phone and cut me off i was very frustrated and angry this had become a hugely stressful situation with absolutely no resolve reassurance or help my app status still displayed an active fault however the agent on the phone told me the line and connection was clear none of this made any sense another few days and still no resolve no connection no broadband but lots of emails regarding upgrading to faster again speaking with talktalk and receiving no help i decided to switch providers i signed up with bt who have been absolutely amazing they have handled the switch for two weeks in the interim of receiving our new router and activation date talktalk have called my phone twice a day every day which has been unacceptable and inconvenient as i am at work constant emails asking me to stay with them i emailed the complaints department for the third time to explain i had no interest in staying this my contract with talktalk ended naturally the day before i switched to bt however today i recieved an email from talktalk telling me i owe for the next of the fact im now a bt have explained i have nothing to pay them my bill was paid up in full the direct debit cancelled and i am now with a new always heard good things regarding talktalk and i cant explain how massively let down i feel by this company to leave us with no broadband service but still attempt to charge us for a terrible customer service experience for then attempting to charge me for a month of service of which i am not a customer and for the absolute abysmal service of however have made the switch extremely easy for us we could install ourselves and an activation date was set their customer service team are uk and ireland based friendly and easy to understand which more importantly means they understand me and the needs and questions i have as a to mention bt are offering a much better service and faster fibre than talktalk for almost ten pound less per month i would advise anyone thinking of switching to talktalk to think twice yes the process of signing up to them is incredibly easy however when you require any form of support or technical assistance the customer care is inadequate the company needs to improve this they need to listen to and understand their customers needs they need to go off script to attempt to understand and resolve a problem but more importantly fix the problem of their inadequate broadband and speed i will never recommend this company and will only ever advise people against using this company,Bad,1.0

234,having been a loyal customer since january and paying over to them i am highly disappointed in recent were supposed to be moving house in december and the people moving into our house had set up broadband for the move in date with another supplier which then cancelled our broadband when we phoned up we were told this is a normal process as another provider is taking over our main issue with this is as the account holder we were never contacted to ask if this is correct or if we wanted to cancel the just received a letter informing us that they had cancelled it so we had to phone to reinstate the broadband that we had not cancelled the moving date had to be moved and so the new owners of the house then set up the broadband for them moving in and again even after complaining about how this was dealt with the last time vodafone just sent us a letter saying the broadband had been cancelled however we were on our honeymoon and were left with days to try and sort this out before we could not reverse the cancellation we have just phoned up to raise a complaint again to basically be told that this isnt their issue and we would have to phone up the new supplier who we have nothing to do with all we expected was communication to check this cancellation was ok to go through with but instead we have wasted hours and money have to phone them up to try and get our point the in sales myself i always endeavour to provide the best customer service i can this has obviously resulted in unrealistic expectations for the customer service i receive back we will not be using vodafone again in the future and will definitely not be recommend them to anybody,Bad,1.0

403,i have been a customer of o for probably years but as soon as one of my contract ends in august i am saying goodbye and good having made a name change by deed poll i wrote to o with both my account information and sent a copy of the dp with my correspondence so that both my accounts could be amended as well as the bank details for the direct october i discovered that only one of my accounts had been amended incorrectly having spoke to customer services several times i was getting nowhere so i emailed the customer complaints department and began emailing with a sarah latham she advised me that all documentation submitted to o is not retained ie they get destroyed although she refused to specifically state that fact before even resolving any issues she automatically credited one of my accounts with a compensation payment but further problems caused by sarah latham soon arose basically she was so incompetent that she was unable to read the name of an emailed copy of my dp so hence my account information was amended incorrectly my bank account details were also not amended as id requested both in my initial correspondence at the beginning of september and via email after a month of emailing and my accounts were still incorrect i eventually rang to speak to speak to sarah line manager and was advised it was clare sagar i left all my information with the lady on the switchboard for a call back i received one email on at am from clare sagar asking for a suitable time to call me which i replied to and im still waiting for a call to this date on the at pm i sent clare sagar a reminder of her call back to me which she chose to are now almost into july months on and the information on my accounts is still incorrect ive made several calls to o customer services to try to get the problem resolved once and for all but all i get from the advisor is that the complaints department have to sort out the issues ive been promised numerous call backs by the advisors from sarah latham andor clare sagar but have received none and not even an email either i have retained every written word from both ladies who deserve to be dismissed from their jobs due their incompetence and false promises its been months now from receiving my compensation credit months total since the problem arose which are still ongoing the amount credited to one of my bills in september was really pitiful and certainly doesnt compensate the months stress and inconvenience that o has caused this is called looking after their customers im hysterical as o havent got a clue how to deliver customer service and as for their complaints i cannot state my true feelings as this review wouldnt get personally have worked in the customer service environment for years for various large well known companies so i know first hand how a customer should be treated if my actions resulted in this type of complaint i most certainly would have been dismissed my only option now is to take this issue to mark evans the head of telefonica and the ombudsman to outline the exact incompetence of o staff and their laughable policies or rather lack of them but then i think ive only got until when i can finally be free of o once and for all so is it really worth it after all this time i think not i have other issues regarding the o network eg no service for the majority of the time hardly any reception where i reside text messages constantly not sending delayed receiving text messages as sometimes ive received or days worth of texts through all at the same time i pay over month in total to o for both my accounts and i cant even send or receive a solitary text when i want to i would never in a million years recommend o to anyone will i be happy to leave o most definitely yes,Bad,1.0

530,unfortunately my experience has not been great and i am currently looking to change company having been a new broadband customer previously broadband was included in rent i had hoped to be more guided and being able to trust fully we moved home and weeks prior i was researching broadband companies to get me ready and set asap due to working from home by a partner company of talk talk i was ensured to be ready to go within to days again as a broadband newbie i trusted the information and based on this signed up once i received a confirmation email the date of set up was already much longer than the initially promised date having felt anxious as i was dependent to have internet due to lock down no work in cafe or other location was possible i started a live chat to enquire and raise my concern and work impact i even escalated prior to submitting a complaint the response was just like from a script it usually takes up to weeks that wasnt helpful and when a goodwill was offered of the first month no charge i shared that it didnt solve the problem but there was no intend of solving or understanding it more than the first month off i agreed and asked if they could inform their teams and partners better to prevent others from having the same experience which is adding stress in addition to the given circumstances then when the box arrived the minimum speed wasnt provided and again there was work impact and i needed to wait more time for an engineer to arrive and test it when he came he confirmed instead of being helped and understood in this situation he only shared that he would give note to the team that a booster is required no team member reached out to me when i chased up they confirmed that i needed a booster nothing had been sent out and i was informed that i would need to be charged again disappointment and i clarified that the service promised wasnt provided and they made an exception they said and provided it free of charge when it arrived and i set up again the desired speed wasnt provided then the bill arrived and i even didnt receive the goodwill and was charged plus other unknown charges i have filed an official complaint letter to terminate the contract as i have spent a lot of time to receive the promised service and i have not received a service for the nd months a bill with an extra charge of arrived again it took my time to follow up and get it corrected which was a mistake on their side only the last agent has provided a great service,Bad,1.0

628,after being on the phone to o for over an hour i can verify that their customer service is a complete shambles i recieved a letter to my company stating that my account had been suspended and unless payment was made within days a debt collector would call upon calling i informed them that actually we have never had an account with them and it was the previous owners debt and could they do something about it their response was because we cant pass their security questions obviously because were not the account holders there was nothing they could do so it leaves me with the option of either paying previous owners bill or facing debt collectors and possible ccj on my company through no fault of my own absolutely fuming will be taking this further,Bad,1.0

635,they dont deserve one star it took weeks to connect me they still took payment from my bank for no service they said they have a switching service where i dont incur charges if i terminate my previous provider early where they take care of that what they mean is that you pay in my case from my bank and they credit my bt account so i am out of pocket they lie they are deceitful they are incompetent and think that customer service is when a customer serves as instructed i sent a message via facebook they said a manager would contact me and discuss my concerns no call i asked when and they said they dont know i think i may know never in spite of owing me for delayed service for switching for refund kinda my account says,Bad,1.0
636,easily one of the most crooked companies ive come across in all my life and i honestly dont understand how legally they manage to get away with the level of service they provide wifi works great until it doesnt and you have no internet for a month and when you try and get in contact its literally impossible then when you finally do contact them its a shrug of the shoulder and basically pushing off providing any help until our internet somehow comes back and we have no reason to contact them anymore my favourite part of their whole experience is asking us to use their service status checker that doesnt work cant get my phone to connect to the wifi but apparently theres no issues in my area try to check my individual router and i always get a were unable to check your status at the moment please try back later i would have thought years would be a long enough wait for the service checker to be working again but apparently not for virgin media only reason they have any business at all is that when their wifi does decide to work its the fastest provider if i could swap away from this unbearable company i would my off currently and i cant even bare the thought of trying to contact them to get it fixed and am trying to work out if i have enough g to last me til it decides to come back on next best thing is i took note of my awful internet speeds for weeks and finally we managed to get an engineer out to check it and apparently the reason the wifi is not working is because we were using the wrong website to check our speed and not the virgin media approved speed checker well surprise surprise it shows my internet speed is amazing a tad strange how it was so fast on this app yet i could still not connect to it crooks,Bad,1.0

677,today is the worst experience i have ever had on online was with asda mobile for years and only switched to ee because asda moved off the ee network onto vodafone and the speed is very slow like mbs vs mbs on mobile support was actually able to help with any issues dont blame the ee staff members they were all very polite and obviously limited in what they can do but it is extremely wasted the whole day trying to find out why my auto renewal didnt go a text yesterday saying would auto renew tomorrow your day pack will renew automatically tomorrow night using your mastercard ending though i figured it did not auto renew as received a text saying would need a data pack to use data on your phone youll need an addon or pack click here to understand why so logged into my account thinking it would be a simple issue and it said error try again later every time i went to the manage payment option also stated my card payment didnt process on th august even though i was not with them on th august didnt join to september spent hours yes hours on chat support i am in bed sick and was frustrating that couldnt get a straight heard account isnt registered just give us some personal details then accounts been cancelled so you have been put through to wrong department then sim only completed transferring today thats why i have been using it for a whole the final one phone hasnt been topped up before so how have i been using it all month why would you need to top up for an auto renewal pack that is meant to take the money every month and is your minutes data and was meant to be on a gb summertime deal as registered on th september days before the deal finished and that was now also kept asking me about the deal did i have proof of the deal i signed up days before it expired i have my bank statement that shows the payment on the th september i dont know if i retained the document they sent the two sim cards attached to that stated the deal i did two sim cards and i even contacted them at the time as in the website packages page it did not show the deal at the time of setting it up it showed up when doing a balance check but not on the text news weve added an extra gb to your pack for free as part of our promotional offer to view your full allowance visit enjoy this offer with the next five packs you was very annoyed now after wasting all those hours so i requested my pac code then decided i would try calling in as one last throw of the dice as i had requested the pac code that had wiped my account apparently and made any recourse impossible and i was still unable to get a reason why my account had been cancelled in the first place which was causing the entire issue the staff obviously must not be able to do a thing so the whole thing is at the mercy of their computers it is like they are all reading from scripts if anything happens no one can help you or fix it and according to their own staff the website is useless was told on the phone you cant setup auto renewal payments on the website we arent in who is going to want to call in everything is done online and what is weird is it did let me set it up and it took the money and it sent me this below as well as sending me the previous text above that says it will auto renew and debit my card but customers are to know this text is incorrect you have to call in as that text is not correct are the texts from ee even really valid its a broken mess you have agreed to enter into a services on demand arrangement this means you authorise us to take payment from the registered debit or credit card every time you pay for an eligible product directly with your card you can cancel this at any time if you cancel within days of your first purchase youll get a refund for any unused good thing was the speed on this network i got more patchy phone reception with lots of dead spots in my house that i didnt previously have though and missed lots of calls the speed was nice but i have switched to,Bad,1.0

810,this is my true honest experience with ee weeks ago as of june th my current contract with them was about to expire current is a g router and sim card for a month gb so i was invited to upgrade by email and letter and the only two options were to upgrade to the same thing gb for or gb for or carry on using my current note those ridiculous upgrade figures for the same thing anyway instead i opted to upgrade to a mobile phone with g for years for so now i would be paying for a g mobile with gb rather than for gb sim only no problem there sounded good having gone through all the process which took ages plus credit checks the order was successful and at the end received an auto email saying this is not an upgrade but a nd account and delivery will be next day of course i had not asked for a nd account to ring ee and being told my wait would be mins with the usual excuse i gave up trying to ring now after weeks to ask why is this a nd line when it was meant to be an upgrade so anyway i thought ok let it be a nd line then and i will deal with the problem when new phone arrives the order by the way said next day delivery which has not happened after weeks or more and i have now given up even trying to contact ee via any means and they have my deposit basically i upgraded on line and at the end of the process they made it into a nd line account and the item never arrived anyway and as for getting my deposit back from ee for the so called upgrade forget that too and being told initially that i can upgrade a current sim only contract to more than what it is now have now cancelled all dealings with ee i have all the evidence on the one noreply email that i received from ee about the order meant to be an upgrade but was not and the date for the delivery next dayi hope you will share this with anyone else thinking of trying the same thing ee appear to have total lack of contact via any means and have broken so many to trust pilot and this is the point i am trying to make ee have now replied yes thanks to trust pilot but ee reply simply says lets solve this problem using fb or twitter which i do not have anyway so back to square if i had not used trust pilot i would never have had any contact with ee at all as they do not publish any email contact and phone contact is a waste of time with ee sadly it is thanks to people such as trust pilot that get things done within an hour as opposed to what could be weeks or never waiting to get contact with do not know how to move on from this now if i had received reassuring reply emails from ee this problem would never have escalated but have had to use trust pilot to help if anyone can find an email address on ee then you have done better than me and forget ringing ee,Bad,1.0

824,i joined ee years ago during this time ive had so many issues some of them ironic tragic funny infuriating and often me many problems ive been able to resolve but only after spending what amounts to hours and hours of my life on the phone because ive been tied into up to separate contracts all running at different times my options to leave ee are limited and quite honestly i dont expect any other provider to perform much better i only mention this as a prelude to my latest experience as i wish it to be known that i am familiar with the traditional failings at ee and the excuses often many of us that follow a policy of when it isnt broke dont fix it ee have recently updated their payment system i tried on two separate occasions to put my account into credit as i usually do in advance of the bill rolling over on both these occasions and after spending nearly an hour in total on the phone the customer service representatives could not take any payment on both occasions i was promised a call back which as with countless other promises of contact did not happen i then made a further call and this time the customer service representative after many attempts connected me to a relay payment system for which i keyed in details of my bank card and then received a message back confirming a payment with authorisation code and reference number the agent duly noted all this information the money left my account after the billed rolled over i phoned to make the payment on the outstanding balance it was then i discovered that my payment was not showing on my account and indeed showed at ees end as declined i checked my bank records and the payment was not still pending but had been taken by ee and was later confirmed as such by my bank i spoke to ee again and this time my query was raised on ees internal system i also spoke to a manager who called me and was reassured that my account was being monitored and the matter would be dealt within hours hours pass no contact no courtesy call to explain what is happening i call again the customer service agent explains to me that whilst the manager is around and he has spoken to her she has not commenced her shift and will call me back sometime today i ask him to go back to her and ask for a better approximation no such estimate is received i called again minutes later manager was on a call matter was resent to her by the latest customer service agent spoken to who again confirms this manager as his team leader so i am at work trying to coordinate essential health care services for the elderly and vulnerable in a busy london borough i am no closer to establishing whether ee know or do not know what they have done with my at this time i am three days away from when the bill is due to be paid as like in so many other circumstances such as the beginning of the pandemic when i was promised my service would not be restricted if my bill was late due to a disruption in salary to me and having to make a late payment to ee it was still restricted not only disrupting essential work but disrupting communications between our family as we have a seriously ill disabled six year old to care for i mention this because yet again on this occasion i have been reassured restrictions wont happen i could and perhaps will one day write a book on the failings i have experienced with ee until then all i want to know is what ee have done with my money and how this ridiculous situation is going to be resolved i pay on average per annum to ee i do not think it too much to expect the courtesy of being told what is going on when timeframes have been given,Bad,1.0

860,had virgin installed weeks ago after moving house and have since spent hours and a lot of money on the phone to them trying to sort problem after problem each issue has taken at least phone calls to sort because of employee incompetence and things still arent right i paid virgin by direct debit for the duration of my month contract in my old house yet just because i moved house for my first months bill they elected to send me a paper bill for the first time ever and charge me for the privilege i asked virgin to transfer my old phone number to my new address and was given a date by which it would be done by it never happened nor did it at the second time of asking despite being given another date rd time lucky the new tivo box was faulty fair enough these things happen and they sent me a new one quick enough however it took phone calls and an hour of my time to activate it because the first person i spoke to had no idea what they were doing and me off telling me they had activated it when they clearly hadnt i phoned to ask for the tv cable to be repositioned as we didnt want the tv in the same location as the previous house occupants virgin gave me a date for the technician to come round i took time off work and waited in all day they never turned up i phoned to ask why and was told the installation had been cancelled on the previous day as an unknown source had informed virgin we were no longer at the address it then transpired there was an unknown email address and mobile phone number attached to my account again added for some unknown reason by an incompetent employee but slightly concerning in terms of data protection etc and virgin had been leasing with this mystery contact regarding my installation virgin tell me that even though my appointment for installation has been cancelled through their own incompetence and through no fault of my own that i will have to wait another week before they can get someone out and ill have to take more time off work weekend installation appointments it seems are only available to brand new customers and once youre at the point where youre no longer legally entitled to cancel your contract with them you become a second rate customer in their eyes every time i phone virgin and as i said this has been many times over the past few weeks i enter my landline number for the system to recognise the account and each time the person i am eventually put through to tells me that my account has been deactivated clearly confusion with the old address and i have to go through the process of them finding my new account by providing my new address and answering further security questions although virgin will go on to take off me over the next months of my contract the best they could offer by way of apology for their continual incompetence and my time and money spent on the phone was a goodwill gesture i was with sky for years and never had a single issue with them virgin are an absolute joke and ill be leaving them the second my contract is finished,Bad,1.0

938,everything is fine until you decide to not renew your contract that is when tricky clauses start to appear and when their employees instead of just doing what you asked for they annoyingly coming up multiple times with different offers to make you stay they even contact you by phone at random hours this literally made me feel like i was in a kind of prison and could not escape from them the worst part was that they wanted to cancel my services after my contract was ending because they were needed a certain amount of time to deliver the packaging equipment to me in order for me to send back their router this will therefore make me pay an extra charge as i would be out of contract at this time the irony here is that although they cut the broadband connection on the time of that day they have not delivered the packaging equipment on time which was their main argument to make me pay an extra fee as i would be out of contract at this time that shows that they were able to cut the broadband service whenever they wanted however they were just searching for ways to get extra money for me also when i asked their employee about the rate of this extra fee eg gbp per day he did not know showing that this was a fee that was just coming out of mind during this time also the employee did not even tell me that i had this option of terminating their services in days and plan was to make me stay for another days with them and pay almost double the amount of my previous contracts monthly charge and times the amount that i paid when i was waiting for days to stop their services,Bad,1.0

1151,spent about minutes reading some of the reviews on here and quite clearly there is a pattern with the people who work in their customer service and how badly trained and rude they are i absolutely cannot emphasise how terrible of an experience i just had on the phone to them for the rd time in about a honestly cant tell you how infuriating it is to have to explain over and over and over again the situation to then be shouted at by the person whos meant to be helping me and aligning with issue im having which in all fairness wasnt even a bad or difficult one long story short virgin put up the price of my bill one month after i had just renewed my contract with them for months so i called them up and asked them if they could match their new customer deal for an existing customer given that it was exactly the same as the one i was already paying for before they decided to inflate the prices for no reason in order to get me to stay the person on the phone sorted me out with said deal only to find out months down the line that my discount code had expired and i was being billed more again no notice no explanation given i contacted them today to question the charges and all the woman wanted to do was shout at me saying there are no discounts available for you and she just simply wouldnt let me finish a sentence without yelling at me i requested to put in a complaint and speak to a manager and she said one would reach out to me within working days so i called a second time hoping someone else would pick up and although he was helpful a few things were funky the manager was actually there because he had to get help from said manager so why did i have to wait days to speak to one they were able to bring the price of my bill back to what it was originally however they said my bill amount will appear as the more expensive figure but i will be charged the lower amount and they couldnt provide me any proof whatsoever of this arrangement being put in place they cant change my bill amount or send me an email with this agreement in writing and i wasnt given a reason as to why either i quite simply do not understand how this company still exists and quite frankly i have been a total fool for signing up for another year with them because its not the first time ive had these problems i would not recommend joining stay away from this company,Bad,1.0

1154,recently received a letter from this company addressed to my ltd i wasnt expecting this i contacted tamar to find out what had happened and why they had written to turned out that a suspected fraudster had opened an account for landline numbers with tamar using my companys detailsthe landlines were fully working and operational and it turns out being used in attempts to open further accounts with other organisations since they were diverting calls to a mobile i pointed this out to tamar and requested they make a report to action fraud they refused to do so and advised that i should do it myself which was incorrect action frauds website advises that reports involving telecoms providers must be filed by the provider after further wrangling with them did they grudgingly agree to file a report on further questioning they admitted that the account in question had generated what they referred to as red flags even before my contact with them which didnt leave me with a high opinion of their know your customer checks the final nail in the coffin from my perspective was that my surname in the letter wasnt even correctly spelt which a cursory check of companies house would have picked upi couldnt and still dont understand why if theyd already raised red flags on this account why hadnt the been suspended before i contacted is a revised version of my review since tamar first messaged me to remove my original and when that didnt get the desired response then reported it to trustpilot as being incomplete who took my review down until it had been trust this report is now sufficiently documents my experience and interaction with their customer services my opinion if tamar spent as much effort on their kyc process as they do looking after their reviews here theyd probably not find themselves in this situation to start with,Bad,1.0
1155,very poor customer service been on several calls had emails that have promised one price which was never applied another email promising another then an email saying my next direct debit would be even higher than both emails then a letter saying my monthly payment would be moving to bath of which are extremely expensive and well above the promised in original email and contract they seem to tell you something on the phone and then not apply it its misleading and disingenuous,Bad,1.0

1162,i have been with virgin for years and there customer service has got worse and worse throughout especially over the last years i think what i find the most offensive is that they really do not seem to care about increasing their customer satisfaction it took weeks for a guy from yet another call centre to call me to see if i still wanted to pursue it come on last chance saloon for me or its adios its only because i am ties in for another months then i am gone,Bad,1.0

1170,i have been a longstanding customer of virgin home i have found their internet service and customer service superb i had mb broadband and on tests it consistently hit that speed or thereabouts because i needed a static ip i decided to move to virgin business expecting the same standard and same or better levels of service i made it clear at the time of transfer that the only reason for my transfer was the need for a static ip a fact which is recorded in their emails to me at the time i was offered a package with a mb download speed and a mb upload speed i was not advised of any to installation there was constant contact from customer services in the phillipines and a promise that i would be contacted immediately following installation to make sure i was happy installation took place just over a week ago i was advised by the fitters that there was a local temporary problem with static ips and that i would not get the full mb download speed while this was being sorted i could expect around mbi tested the download speed over the next hours and found i was getting at best mb and even as little as mb i contacted virgin support and was told my problem had been logged and i was given a ticket no things deteriorated over the next few days with download speed falling to mbs and upload speed which had been consistently good initially intermittently failing altogether i had heard nothing from virgin support i telephoned support a few days ago to be told a that the ticket no i had provided did not relate to my company and b that they had no record of a support ticket for my company i ran through the problem i was experiencing and i was advised that it was a longstanding issue with static ips and the only suggestion for resolving it would be to abandon the static ipi contacted customer services immediately by email to raise this issue i was ignored two days later i emailed virgin customer services expressing my extreme frustration that they were ignoring me and giving them until am today to confirm that a senior manager would contact me otherwise i would press the nuclear button i advised them that given what their support team had advised me re the issue with static ips i considered that they had obtained a contract from me by deliberate misrepresentation whilst i obtained a read receipt for my email i have needless to say heard nothing further from virgin it is now over hours past the go anywhere near these people have a look at zen who consistently get great ratings,Bad,1.0
1171,update th below an updated version of my email to talk talk sent today its self explanatory i dont expect a reply other than to go onto their online community or contact them on twitter again its all about the customer doing the legwork even when its about account is now thankfully closed and all sums paid i am content that i paid what talktalk told me i would have to pay if not the sum am still highly dissatisfied by your treatment of customers in particular the way talk talk holds onto customers cash and the lack of discrimination applied to customers just as i thought i had put talk talk behind me a nasty reminder and further financial pain has arrived by way of my latest mobile telephone bill i do not have a talktalk mobile the bill includes a sum of charge for the privilege of talking to your customer services line for minutes the call was an attempt by me to understand my bill and most of which was on hold there was no other access to talktalk customer services at the time and my previous correspondence was just met with an automated message to use a customer forum or twitter i am again flabbergasted and out of pocket i have received no call from you i only ever received an automated response to my original is little wonder i reverted to and will revert again to trust pilot and continue to advise anyone who talks about switching accounts to talktalk to think th jan see below im still waiting for contact and refund tt remain with my money in their bank account original post i closed my account due to a bereavement and the property being sold talk talk advised me of an early termination fee and that it would be paid via my direct debit and all other ongoing charges would cease but that i should not terminate the dd arrangements as they would do this when the account was cleared they subsequently cancelled the line as expected marked the account as closed but then continued to charge monthly charges for periods after the line was closed worse than this they were increased charges and for new services there is no number to ring their online chat is never available i feel like i have been pick pocketed and the perpetrator has disappeared into the ether update jan despite a quick response from tt on trust pilot their advise was of no use did they read my post in full the online chat remains unavailable whenever i log on and i dont use twitter i had also called the complaints line before i made my trust pilot post and they promised a supervisor would ring back i am still waiting the issue remain unresolved tt remain holding money from my mothers estate no change other than my rating is under review it will probably head south,Bad,1.0

1433,wasted a considerable amount of my valuable time yesterday on live chat as the customer service telephone number not surprisingly was inundated with calls to this disreputable and mostly inept and useless password resetting did not restore the email account why would it when the same process had failed twice before i was told that the issue would be referred and that it would be dealt with within working days another week this essentially means my problem has been chucked in the garbage as i am still waiting for a call back from virgin media from last friday a week i went to the local library out of desperation to see if my account could be accessed from a different was a task that i was unable to complete not as i expected because the account was not accessible but because of another software issue from this useless could not log in the software would not accept the new passwords when i changed the password again i was unable to log in even though i received confirmation that i was able to do so with the new many others i am overcharged for a basic broadband service so that virgin media can supplement the costs of new is becoming increasingly apparent that this issue will not be resolved virgin media is obviously clueless and does not give an f about its i leave this s of a company without my email account being restored i am likely to lose close to it is unlikely but it is my sincere wish that virgin media fails because of what it has done to me and many other of its have submitted a complaint to to virgin media no need to reply to this email your replies like your company are useless time would be better spent sorting issues rather than adding worthless that would require knowledge and intelligence neither of which is known at virgin media,Bad,1.0

1475,unfortunately i cannot give zero do not get your internet from virgin media run away while you can this is the umpteenth issue i have had with virgin media while being a customer for years they messed up my billing serveral times stealing money from my bank account that was above what i had agreed to pay them which was the basis of me entering into contracts with them as per uk contract law which dates in customary form to the middle ages was crystallised into formal law following this they have done this on at least three and they have only paid me back in full messed up my moving house twice once when i tried to delay the move date and they cut off my account and then when i actually moved i had confirmation in writing that they had changed the moving date having had to contact their awful whatsapp customer service from abroad when my move was delayed then once again when they reinstated it and in doing so had to set up a new account they accidentally overcharged me i filled a complaint and for the only time cs actually dealt with it properly they credited me with recompense and my account was in credit when i moved then they failed to do my installation on the agreed date later claimed that there were building works that made it impossible for the engineer to access the house which is a lie after hours on the phone and a threat to not install it for months unless i paid a premium charge to have it in a month i work from home and to refund this they finally installed it they never did repay that fee then started a new account meaning i lost the credit that they repaid after they helped themselves to money from my account previously they agreed to having the same contracted amount per month as previously for months from august then the service was like being in the s i live in london in an area with superfast broadband and cables but you could only use the wifi withing metres of the router after many calls with people speaking to me like i was an idiot and just following a script telling me to restart their modem etc and then telling me that i could pay to rent pods to boost the service my flat is m so this is ridiculous how weak was it the extender kit that i have so i could previously use wifi in my long garden from my old m house would not even pick up the signal to boost eventually they agreed to send an engineer who just said you have a weak signal well done einstein and left without resolving it after many more calls they finally sent another engineer who ordered new cables from the street but then they left a huge roll of cable in the shared front garden and didnt actually connect it to my flat eventually two engineers later it was connected and the router relocated fine service in half the flat nothing to get excited about especially if you wanted to lie in my bedroom watching a film as service there nonexistent still ah i will change when the contract is up in aug i think then they lose my credit from their previous refuse to pay back the connection fee i moved house which is meant to be free failed to apply the discount to the bill that would keep my contractually agreed amount eventually after many phone calls they replied to my written complaint with lies and weird accusations like it was my choice to open a new account and then chose an express connection service and they did apply the discount and charge me the correct agreed amount i will note here that they do this contract less discount so that they can accidentally not apply the discount and help themselves to money from your account and so that you cannot leave until the contract ends a vile business practice that says everything about this company someone then called and offered a month free as fine that was applied in an and feb and i just wanted to never contact cs again then no no no normally i do not bother opening mails if i know the bill will just say until last month when i opened one and it said and the two before are and tomorrow is again they just take this from my bank account which is theft as it is not the amount that i agreed to pay when i entered into a contract with them another hours on the phone and nothing resolved spoken down to by three men another was pleasant but unable to assist so put me through to someone else but i just was on hold for an hour being passed from department to department being called the pejorative miss despite explaining my title eight times being told that the contract was months a lie and that i wouldnt get the money back well i can through court and a complaint to and maybe he could give me a new contract with a great,Bad,1.0

1548,looking at previous reviews of asda mobile i was really dubious how a company could be so bad in order to receive overwhelmingly dreadful reviews well now i know i needed a cheap one off sim card and bundle so bought an asda mobile one i topped up the card with and selected the phone bundle expecting that to be charged to the topped up amount oh no they dont do it that way my credit card was charged and additionally i was also charged another my intention was just to use the phone for a month with that bundle and no further recurring charges not a problem i thought i just need to speak to them and they will correct and refund the overpayments so i called them on th may and spoke to a customer representative omar who after being given all the facts confirmed the overpayment and said they would be refunding to my card within days nearly a month later and no refund i called them again another agent answered and i explained the situation and that i would like my money that they promised to refund this agent also called omar perhaps they only employ people named omar so customers cant individually identify who they speak to after many long can you hold the line while i speak to my manager moments said they could see the sitting on the phone as a top up but only one amount this was despite two amounts clearly showing on my card statement although i explained the previous agent had managed to find them and his confirmation to refund the later agent said that that agent had been wrong and they would need proof from me that two amounts had been charged he would need a copy from my card statement before they could issue any refund i said how ridiculous this sounded for a relatively small amount of money but his argument was what if lots of people call asda mobile requesting refunds without checking they are genuine it would cost them financially yeah im sure that happens all the time in addition any return of money would be in the form of an e gift card as opposed to being not as previously promised to the card it was paid from so two conflicting outcomes from agents at the same company obviously i was not happy with this and said i needed to speak to the manager who had apparently instructed him no problem they will call me back within hours yes hours for the money is insignificant it is is the principle of large shoddy companies taking advantage and not following through on promises also another thing to note after calling them and speaking to an agent you will received a text message asking how likely you are to recommend asda mobile to a friend from highly likely to highly unlikely when you try to send a figure it always comes up as undelivered perhaps thats done deliberately so they do not get negative the lowest rating i can give is one star as they are absolutely in the negative star in closing i would urge anyone considering anything to do with asda mobile to steer clear of them with the longest you can find,Bad,1.0

ive made read on if you dont have the patience just look at the length of this month saga which still isnt resolved to add insult to injury i was suspended from the service this week and so now cant even phone the vodafone complaints number which is blocked to people with no account my account was blocked because of a vodafone company error ive also had zero response to multiple phone calls and two letters of complaint heres the timeline vodafone are you out there somewhere end july blackberry handset deteriorating keys sticking called vodafone to explore possible replacement explained that i would be abroad for months and needed reliable handset was advised that upgrade to iphone was possible and that i could transfer my existing number to new phone also advised that no further action was necessary on direct debit since an arrangement with my bank was already in place phone dispatched and arrived within days all good so on august london paddington vodafone store requested transfer of phone number as well as contacts was told there was another number on my account i explained that i only wanted one line and was looking simply to transfer my number august service suspended with no explanation by text or email contacted vodafone helpline from abroad was advised to install a local sim and deal with the problem on my return september nd arrived back in uk found letter informing me of suspension of account called asked if i could settle my bill in order to be reconnected was given several contradictory quotes in my first phone call we settled on a final sum which i duly paid by credit card was further informed that direct debit request had not been accepted by my bank and that i would need to ask them to reinstate the direct debit arrangement contacted natwest who informed me that they were unable to reinstate the direct debit since it was cancelled by vodafone wrote letter of complaint outlining the story so far and requesting reinstatement of direct debit was called by vodafone with a further issue was told that i had been wrongly informed about the possibility of transferring my number and upgrading to an iphone that in fact none of this was possible under the terms of my february deal and that i faced the possibility of a paying a double line rental until december and b paying an upgrade fee on something in the region of was further informed that the matter could not be resolved until vodafone had listened in to recordings of my july phone calls which would take days i would then hear the outcome wrote and posted letter of complaint to vodafone head office september no word from vodafone by text email or letter re my international assistance from abroad to query bill for gbp of which i was informed on sept by sms kept waiting on phone for ca minutes informed there was no record of me having paid bill on sept nor of me having requested cancellation of second line on that date also told it was impossible to cancel the second line as there was still money owing on it though i explained i had never wanted this line and had effectively been it told no record would be kept of this call except recording for quality purposes further informed that there was no record in my account details of phone call on sept nor of my complaint advised to go to vodafone shop on my return to sort this out october arrived back in uk went straight to vodafone shop in paddington after discovering that my account had been suspended no answer yet received by letter text or phone to my letter and phone call of september despite the fact that i was told my query would be resolved within five days of that call explained to manager of paddington store that i had an outstanding complaint which involved his store it was at the paddington store that i asked to transfer my number on august rd the assistant who served me did not cancel nor advise me to cancel the number i had originally been issued with on my iphone once again requested a backdated cancellation of the second line as well as of the line rental i have been charged since late july the supposedly outstanding line rental balance is the reason vodafone gives for my line now having been suspended paddington shop assistant called vodafone explained the issue to customer services and handed her handset to me to continue the conversation i explained my issue three times to different departments customer services billing who were briefed in writing by customer services and recall who were not briefed so i had to explain my whole story again as well as going through my telephone security questions as i had already done twice during the same call was transferred for a fourth time back to customer services each advisor had told me they needed to speak to their manager but in the end simply passed me on to a different department i had by this point been on the phone for some minutes store manager offered to take over the call he spent a further minutes being passed in similar manner around departments he then finished the call and informed me my case had been escalated for further consideration and that i would be informed within four to five days of the outcome he agreed that it was unacceptable to be passed around departments with no resolution of my case attempted and undertook to take the issue up with his regional manager returned home attempted to call customer complaints line to lodge a further formal complaint about the continuing delay with my case discovered that the automatic complaints line only deals with registered vodafone numbers my number has been blocked so i am unable to lodge a complaint october wrote and posted second letter of complaint to vodafone head office posted edited version of timeline on vodafone returned home from work

1730,utterly horrendous customer servicei agreed a package that i was very happy with and ready to praise virgin to the hilltops but the engineer said that the cabling was going to be difficult and make a mess he was right and a very nice guy he suggested a stream box this meant i wont be able to record but i took that on the said that i would need to talk to customer services and they would change the contract after a long conversation they agreed me a contract which they told me was exactly the same but a month cheaper im still very happy at this the engineer finds out theyve changed the install date to days later so the router wont start up annoying this was despite the engineers being on the line to them they knew he was at my then another calls up to now and they cant sort it and in the end just cut me engineer luckily managed to call his boss and sort the date annoyed but sets up the tv no sports its just a bog standard package the equivalent of i am really more calls to customers service and i finally get through to a nice scottish lady who says she will sort it out and call me tomorrow she never calls day off is spent and i have to find time to call again get through to a nice fella who says they cant sort me out a package and ill just have to add on the extra apps and that will be more expensive than my original am totally stressed and i have nothing to show for itthe broadband is fast but i have no utter shambles of a company i wish id stayed with have no idea what to do next,Bad,1.0
1731,avoid at all at all costs they talk you into switching early and tell you theyll cover your switching costs they dont tell you how to claim the switching costs all they do is wait until you complain and its too late to get a termination letter from your incumbent provider and dont say that they need a specific letter dated in a certain date and theyll only pay a fraction of it in fact they wont pay any if it even if you clearly demonstrate that you have paid ongoing and outstanding fees with your incumbent provider and email them the evidence you need to roll a with one dice to get the money they wont acknowledge what was said by the conman salesperson either or not said my recommendation is to go to the financial ombudsman win or lose it costs them for the process dont change early it will only benefit bt and they wont pay switching fees even if they promise to i work for a larger financial institution than bt and we have a similar option unlike bt we tell new customers what they need to do at point if sale if they cant satisfy the full criteria we sign it off anyway as long as they can demonstrate they have ongoing costs even if it is not the letter we asked for whats the point in arguing we get a happy customer that doesnt leave doesnt complain doesnt go to the financial ombudsman doesnt keep emailing us and phoning us doesnt cost our services time and money and we care about our customers if they can prove they have ongoing costs and weve promised to pay it we pay it why waste each others time why dont you see sense bt and have some consideration for your customers your ongoing costs and your staff with the time im taking up speaking to your staff and the financial ombudsman fee why make it so hard,Bad,1.0

1798,after christmas i needed mobile broadband urgently so i thought itll be quicker to visit the uxbridge vodafone store and get a dongle it took the sales man minutes to sign me up for it promised that service will be available to use straight home charged it put the sim in and it didnt telephony who said they cant do anything except for ordering a new sim now i dont have mobile phone with vodafone so was using my mobile to call them and after minutes being told that nothing can be done i complained about the service and the guy said let me try something he puts me on hold then comes back and says that your sim will be up and running in an hour or so but i have to read you the tcs i thought of it as a normal procedure as i realised that being th december and to get my broadband up and running i need to call them before closing hour because what i was on the phone meant that sim would be functional after the relevant telephony is closed so i called and spoke to a lady who told me that there is no solution except for a new sim so requested her to order me the same as my package of days rolling contract of mobile broadband she told me that she needs to now read me the tcs at this point i asked her to check if the reviews colleague might have ordered a sim she confirmed that no sim was ordered and she is the only person ordering the sim i requested her to pass me to complaints team to lodge my concern about the incompetency of the store staff member she puts me in a queue and the person i spoke to said that complaint manager will call you in days we are in the new year now and still no i received sim cards i thought if i just use one of them that should be ok as its two sims for the same i wanted to buy a bundle so went online and found an economical way to contact vodafone via their to ajay who did that for me and informed that i have two numbers so i asked if i can cancel to which he tried transferring me to disconnection and chat got terminated and couldnt get reconnected to next day i had a direct debit for vodafone go out for instead of and two letters came through the informed about my number which was for days contract and the other sim was a year contract simi was gutted and shocked that what is wrong with vodafone are they a company who is just sales driven and on their chats they will promise you something like a call back but no call just to get good ratings at the end of the day chatted to rajkumar who said that i have to call to cancel the sim that i dont want as i am still in my cooling off him about my complaint and any idea if i will be getting a call back he could tell me anything told him that i wanted to complain about this and new contract given without my just said that i will pass your feedback to the concerned team i asked him that i would like to get a reference number for my complaint but he said that he cant do that asked for an email to send the complaint to and he said that he didnt have that called up today after a long wait called was answered after specifying to the automated system that i was calling to cancel but i had to be transferred so when i was transferred i was sent to the main menu and then happened times then had the privilege of speaking jody who said that the sim ordered without your consent is a fraud and i cannot cancel your sim so i am going to transfer you to the fraud team this time i end up speaking to a man who tells me that he provides escort services and has nothing to do with vodafone fraud was another hour of my day and money spent to contact called back and spoke to claire who was reluctant to tell her name the second time she confirmed that she cancelled the year contract when i am trying to login with my days rolling sim it tells me that i have cancelled this service and still stuck with year sim husband gets discount with vodafone and was planning to move from to them but after this horrendous experience i am willing to preach anyone to never get anything from core culture seems to be like a rogue environment with only objective to sale and retain clients with cheap dirty maturity in staff or sense of decency or truthfulness i will be tomorrow cancelling the other sim and hoping that i have to never interact with such a pathetic and horrible will be writing to the ombudsman ofcom but such companies do not change until the executives put the company in the right have been with for almost years they do not have the best connection signal but their service is far much better and not even possible to compare them with explain the frustration stress and grief that i have had while dealing with vodafone,Bad,1.0

1986,i wouldnt know where to start the service broadband and phone is great ive never really had a problem apart from the odd little broadband dropout a couple of times customer services are a completely different story though online chat is good with pros and cons because i have slight hearing difficulties i find it very very hard to understand the asian and african accents of almost every adviser i have spoken to at talktalk customer services using the phone so live chat is better for me to resolve a simple query or problem the con being that they seem to insert scripts into the conversation that are totally meaningless when you are trying to resolve a complicated problem i find myself explaining the problem in half a dozen different phrases in order for them to catch on to what i am trying to get to the bottom of on a phone call it is somewhat quicker to correct their assumptions and get them to understand the problem and in my case it was a big problem theyd cancelled my which had only been installed months earlier it started when i received a cold call from a scottish accented chap from talktalk offering me a full fibre upgrade to with free installation by bt and the ability to keep my landline which i use to call all the friends and family whom i had over the years gotten to move over to talktalk all for exactly the same price that i was paying for my mb copper connection so i agreed of course three months later i had a little problem i cant remember what it was now it was trivial the lady i spoke to at talktalk said that she could see that i had two orders on my account and that was causing the problem and that she would cancel the unused one i said thank you and left the chat next thing i know the internet on the was dead but i had a signal on the copper line i phoned messaged chatted emailed for over a month to everyone in tts customer services i reckon going around and around in circles for that month eventually they said that i would have to cancel my service and apply for a new installation i banged my head against a brick wall trying to get them to understand that i had a line they even sent out to my home to check it was working the problem with taking on a new installation for me was that i would lose my phone line i ended up telling them not to bother i would keep my copper service and slower speed and stay as i had been for the last month on my copper pair of cables that worked well until th of october we came home from a weeks break away from home to find we had no internet service just the dial tone on the line from until hrs i was passed from pillar to post and back again before a guy said that talktalk had been moving the data services off of the copper lines and porting them onto the fibre network and that my although installed since march they had attached another number to my fibre line in the previous months had never been activated and that i would have to call the business department and so it went on around again and again i had to cancel my direct debit which had been active with them since go through a credit check set up a new direct debit with my bank and then i was told that as we couldnt activate our alarm system cctv or smart heating because of no connectivity they would make us a priority case and hopefully be back on in to hrs next day i got an email saying bt would come to install our line on the th november and my new modem would be delivered beforehand i called tt customer services and told them that the line was already installed bt had checked it back in march at their insistence and i had a modem with a green power light and green steady pon passive optical network light meaning that the line was fine going to the exchange but not active and couldnt they just activate it also i told them that i had new routers and didnt need another one the guy said he would cancel the delivery of the router but bt would still call to check the system next day a new router arrived bt are due on saturday i noticed direct debits for talktalk on my banking app so i cancelled the one dated and left the one dated th oct instated i had asked the tt adviser prior to cancelling the old dd and he said that i could and that it would be superseded by the new one anyway today i got an email saying that they have noticed that my dd was cancelled and i should set up one to avoid a late payment charge of and yesterday morning the full fibre internet signal was back on im not going to cancel bt in case tt fook everything up again i also now have direct debits set up for them omg i give up edit regarding reply from talktalk no thank you youve buggered things up enough already,Bad,1.0

2253,this is the probably the worse company i had to deal with and there is plenty of incompetence around the world they never turn up they try to reschedule extremely poor time management then they try to do the job without double checking with the client if the equipment is actually working the fault is probably of the managers at the company that overwork the employees and they seem to be always in a rush so the service is horrible i am not a very demanding person all i wanted was for them to do their job in their time slot and leave the equipment in working condition please dont use im on my second appointment and counting,Bad,1.0

2443,before you consider joining vodafone please read mum has been a loyal customer of vodafone for years she has renewed a contract every two years and when i was bought me my first mobile a pay as you go with vodafone these phones eventually graduated onto contracts with mobiles as part of the payment plan my mum has degenerative spinal disease so cannot work and is tremendous amounts of pain every day as i got older and started going out more both me and mum decided that we needed reliable phones so that if i went out and mum had a fall she could easily reach me they are essential as i am now her fulltime carer in january the contract was renewed and we got shiny new samsung galaxy s edges as mum was a loyal customer and had been with vodafone for a long time she received a discount on the plan the total for both phones was a month this discount was supposed to remain in place for the year contract in other words up until january of this year in november of the direct debit got cancelled by the bank possibly due to lack of funds as mum is disabled and cannot work normally if you do not pay your bill vodafone restrict your service yes in our case they didnt from november of up until april of no payments were made and our service wasnt restricted we had no reason to doubt that the bill wasnt going out as the phones never got restricted vodafone never sent a text letter email or even made a phone call to notify us that the bill was adding up in addition to this the line rental increased from for both lines to for each line a month in total unfortunately i have no idea when this was changed as online billing records only go back months however in august of this change had already been made again vodafone failed to inform us of this when we finally discovered this in the april of this year the bill was around the mark my mum rang up to find out why this had happened and why vodafone hadnt notified us of the failure of billing she was instantly blamed by vodafone for not paying the bill and told that it was her fault our lines were also restricted it was finally agreed after many hours of fighting that we would keep our phones and pay a month per line rental totalling a month this is bringing the bill down by a whopping a month we are also now on sim only contracts and with two and a half year old phones that are beginning to break a lot of arguing we were finally put through customer relations and began speaking with a lady named sheetal she has since agreed that the discount was removed prematurely and has refunded us that money she claimed it added up to however i cannot find a refund of this amount on the account anywhere instead one in march which is before we even found out about the bill and one for in may when i asked sheetal if she had compared the data usage of our phones against the months where there was no payments made she said she didnt have the statements and that it would take hours to get them and that she would ring us back on the saturday that was a week an half ago we are still waiting for a return call from of the th of august the bill is despite mum paying the agreed amount of a month we have had our mobile service frequently restricted this happens at least twice a month it has also happened while ive been out and heartbreakingly my mum had a fall which in itself is not that uncommon and normally she can reach me but since vodafone had restricted our service she couldnt call anyone and was stuck on the floor where she had fallen for over two hours this left her in agony for several days and made me feel extremely guilty i have since stopped going out in case it happens again two days ago our service was again restricted despite the payment being made and again we rang up and had an argument with customer relations eventually our lines were reconnected and we were told we would receive a call from sheetal today instead we got a phone call from a man called asif he asked for mum to pay the bill of over a three month payment plan a month forgive me for not working it out when mum tried to explain what the she was disabled and that she would never be able to pay over three months he abruptly cut her off and very rudely said yes i know that and your daughter helps you ive read the notes if he had read the notes then he must have read that is all we can afford a month why after reading that did he ask for a three month payment plan when she explained again that she couldnt pay that much and that is all she can afford he threatened her with our phone numbers being deleted and being taken to court this left my mum in tears fearing bailiffs we are now waiting for sheetal to ring tomorrow hopefully ultimately my argument with vodafone is that they will not admit they made a mistake in failing to either restrict our lines when the bill stopped going through or send out a letter make a phone call or send a text to inform us it isnt about the bill anymore i just wish they would admit they were wrong and take ownership of the suffering they are putting my mum advice to any potential vodafone customer is to run to another company as fast as humanly possible as if this is how they treat loyal customers i can only dread to think of how they would treat new customers,Bad,1.0

2475,unfortunately i have been a customer with tesco mobile for years phoned customer service to pay off the remainder of one of my handsets so as i could gift it to my grandson all went smoothly or so i thought was taken from my bank account the months bill was due to be paid so i paid that a few days later i didnt notice at the time it was less than it should have been i discovered later that two payments for the associated number had been billed with one payment having been deducted getting back to the handset i thought i had paid off the app it informed me that my handset was now paid previously it had said there was left to pay i have taken screenshots and forwarded those to customer services the handset in question is not present on available devices it has vanished what would anyone assume but that it had been paid off as requested low and behold this month tesco mobile requested another for the handset that doesnt exist anywhere i phoned customer services again despite being bedded with flu the lady i spoke to was great she told me to complain as she could see the id paid but couldnt see where the full amount had went to i did just that and got a message in reply to my complaint saying that they apologised and were willing to work with me to rectify the issue that was on the opening lines of the email half way through the email it was implied that they had done nothing wrong and had carried out my requests and the new bill needed to be paid they opened and closed the complaint on their terms without taking any notice of my query as where my money had went and why if this was the case had half of it been used to pay for the same sim plan twice if anything were to come out of this then it would be for a huge company such as tesco to take responsibility for the disgraceful assumptions they make on their customers characters i have practically been called a liar my money has been bounced about their system to do as they like with technically speaking excuse the pun my grandson does not own his phone that granny gave him as a gift tesco seem to think they do what a disgraceful way to treat people im absolutely disgusted,Bad,1.0

2527,ive been an o mobile customer for months the experience didnt begin well as os switching process was poor and wasnt clear if my attempt to begin a switch of my number had been successful os website also feels rather dated and is at times frustrating to navigate however the biggest issue is mobile data which compared to ees network is very slow in the area around both my home and place of work making even small downloads difficult on a positive voice coverage is good in most location i had switched to o as i no indoor voice coverage with ee at my place of work however such poor data service combined with a poor website means im now switching to another network,Bad,2.0

2531,you cannot get through to a human being to speak to or wait an eternity you could have a nice course lunch while you now by ee i went for an upgrade and new contract but i was concerned about data useage as i use it a lot was told by an ee rep gigs is plenty after looking at your last months useage ok lets do it then i said after a short while data useage alert essentially the rep lied just to sell me the contract and gigs wasnt enough dont trust tmobile is now owned by ee i cannot now get unlimited data with either of them so i wont renew any contract,Bad,2.0

2543,good speeds and easy self installation my house was already set up for virgin media however experience marred by the terrible hub installing we had inconsistent wifi that was constantly dropping out for weeks at first it didnt even occur to me it could be a router problem as ive had wifi for over years and never had any issues like this caused by a router also my house isnt particularly big and i dont have hundreds of devices connected however after researching online i found out the hub was the likely culprit and i can confirm after putting the hub into modem mode and connecting a tp link deco mesh wifi system highly recommended the internet has been flawless ever since flabbergasted virgin who are one of the more expensive internet providers dont provide a router that is fit for purpose cant help but think whether its intentionally bad to try and get people to buy their little wifi boosters which would definitely be a waste of money just get yourself a proper mesh wifi setup,Bad,2.0

2547,whilst the internet service has been generally pretty good the customer service leaves a lot to be moved house earlier this year and kept our service with zen and we were told that the service would take over a month to activate and then given an unlimited mobile hotspot as a substitute for the router which had a gb limit for the whole month that wasnt communicated at all ie you cant to get a hold of any of their teams is like trying to pull teeth from a hamster during calls we ended up instead going through technical support and asking them to pass us through to other teams as the wait times were nearly an hour long on the normal routes whilst they took a shorter time via technical support attempting to get a hold of them from any other way will result in long waiting times constant ticket tennis and unreliable to change account details our direct debit has been painful as well it cant be done on their website attempting to contact support led to us being passed from the sales team to the provisioning team and it has now been a week and we still have not been contacted back about unfortunate one of the draws of zen on which was its excellent customer service but thats proving to be false,Bad,2.0
2548,i had no choice while join this provider in my property in london in sep the problem was that i had to go abroad and arranged this internet from virgin to my tenant it works now and im not aware of quality but what makes me almost insane that i cannot communicate with virgin for the last months all i wish is the password for my login which never arrived to my email to be able check the balance or to change tariff plan to manage landline number and see the charges i tried all possible email addresses available for search in the google about virgin but nobody never answer i tried many telephone numbers i could find but all i achieved is the listening to the music for p per minute while calling from abroad once i had my personal record of minutes hanging on the phone but usually i give up after minutes while try to talk to their customer support i lived in so many places around the world but such approach to customers is my most disgusting experience i ever had from internet service provider they simply do not wish to communicate i tried to send friends to the office in hammersmith in london but they enjoyed situation and it is not possible even to leave a note about my problem once ill be back i will cancel the service and repost this feedback everywhere its possible stay away from but dont fool yourself and confess uk internet and you know it,Bad,2.0

2556,spent over an hour and a half being passed back and forth to different departments all who were trying to get me to purchase my broadband over the phone and try and tell me not to get the cheaper offer online so basically i am moving into a new flat this week and saw a good offer for broadband online i was in the process of buying this deal when i saw it came with a voucher offer so decided to give them a call to ask about the voucher in hand the voucher was just a bonus as i was more interested in the good broadband deal i was asking about this and was advised i would not qualify for the voucher which lets be honest i wasnt expecting it so have no issue with that however i was then told that the broadband deal i was seeing online wasnt working very well and that i should purchase over the phone the deal i was being offered over the phone worked out alot more than the deal i was in the process of buying i mentioned this and again was told i should buy over the phone because i could end up being rejected online and then have to call back at this point i must state that i would have had no issue with buying over the phone it was purely the fact that price online was more suitable so anyway as i am not very good with technical speak and all these various prices i said to the person on the phone that i was going to go speak to my boyfriend as he works for a company dealing with phones and broadband so i always ask him for advice when it comes to things like this the talktalk adviser then misinterpreted what i had said and was quite rude in the way he was telling me that the shop in question would offer different prices i then had to explain that i was planning on going with talktalk and i was merely saying that i was going to seek advice as i wasnt understanding most of the jargon and prices at this point i was in alot of confusion about what was going on i was only calling to ask a question instead of being told not to order online i then asked him as an employee why is he telling me not to purchase one of their products online which he replied saying to go ahead but i will only be calling back once it gets rejected i asked why it would get rejected and he told me it was to do with the local exchange after the phonecall i asked advice from said bf who explained that shouldnt affect buying it at this point i told the advisor on the phone he had scared me off now as i was confused what to do and i would be better off with another provider to be fair the guy did tell me he didnt mean to scare me off and to try online and see if it works so half an hour later i have managed to purchase online successfully and decided to call back and ask a question about transferring it to another address in the future this time around i was greeted by a guy who then again tried to get me to purchase over the phone even though i told him i was buying online he then told me that this offer is incorrect and shouldnt be there and i asked why it was being shown to which he replied that it shouldnt be again i felt alot of pressure to purchase over the phone rather than answer my questions i was trying to be polite and say i do not want that offer as it is more expensive and would need to consult my flat mate which he then was pushing at me to ask her i told him that she is not here which she isnt as we havent moved in together yet and then he said he would call her and keep me on hold i dont understand why this conversation again got misled i would completely understand if they were speaking to me and listening to my query and then mentioning their over the phone deals but this was really in your face and pushy there was no customer understanding whatsoever anyway back to the phonecall after me saying how i am getting this deal online the guy said i wont be getting it and to buy over the phone i then told him i had an order number after purchasing it to which he changed his tune and was like oh really hold on why i ask how you managed that then he put me through to another advisor cue me being on the phone for a very long time being put through to another few people all of who did not understand why i was calling i was trying to explain that i have purchased this deal online and that previous advisors are telling me it doesnt work and i am concerned what is going on i am now sitting here very confused as to what is going on i currently have an email with an order number and an installation date but after being advised by two talktalk employees that the offer i bought is not available even though the website states day left i still do not know if i am going to be getting what i have paid for and i am annoyed that nobody could answer this for me i have worked for various call centres in the past i am a polite person and very understanding so when they were telling me of the phone offers i was listening and this did not offend me i understand companies have targets and they can be tough on employees however i am very annoyed that not only did it sound like two people were trying to get me to not buy online so that they met their target it was also the way i was being spoken to and the lack of understanding in total i spoke to possibly people and i am still unaware of the situation you should not be advertising online of a certain offer which ends in one day i have been looking at it all week and decided to go for it after consulting flat mate so i am aware this offer still had time left and anyway i was not told that this offer had expired i was purely being told in the first instance it might not work and in the second that it be there it is false advertising and i am now very concerned i am going to end up with a contract to a company who are more concerned at meeting targets rather than customer satisfaction without customers there would be no business and i think alot of companies these days need to remember this this is my first ever complaint so i am sorry if it is a bit long winded but i am very disappointed,Bad,2.0
2557,i know it is the duty of any staff to try their utmost to retain a customer who is trying to leave the company however the chat staff was and in my experience talk talk always very slow i understand they have to deal with several chat enquiries simultaneously however it took min to complete the security checking it was another min to retrieve my details before talking further during this min i was sitting in front of my computer and responded to any questions immediately this is a hectic work who can afford to waste min before any thing can be formally started i like talk talk otherwise i wont border to take time to write this review,Bad,2.0

2563,over recent years we have suffered several losses of internet as well as loss of phone connection on one occasion for several days i did receive some compensation for this but i would rather have a good reliable service so that i do not need to spend many hours on the phone trying to get the faults addition our cable service is very unreliable and currently we cannot access terrestrial tv except by iplayer i have been putting off calling about this as i anticipate from previous experience that i will be kept waiting on the phone for a long time and then simply sent a text that will tell me what to do to fix it i would rather talk to a human being who can either tell me what the problem is and how to fix it or who will arrange for someone to come and repair i have another account with bt for another property and i have to say that it is a great deal easier to get an operator on the phone with bt than it is with virgin,Bad,2.0

2566,just ended our contract with virgin after year and months where we got an initial deal with failed to connect our services on the correct day meaning we were without internet for a week failed promises and excuses however they did give us around off per month which meant weve only been paying per month for a pretty good broadband speed the only reason we kept with them was because trying to switch to another provider would have meant waiting a month for an activation date unfortunately however in the last month our speed and internet connection has been so up and down and unreliable i change providers after every contract to get a better deal its an initial pain but normally is sorted by the vendor themselves however as virgin work off a different line you need to contact them to cancel direct i used the online chat facility to cancel with virgin and it took minutes of me repeatedly saying i didnt want a better deal to cancel in summary poor initial setup good speeds until recently and then desperation to keep us as a customer causing annoyance by customer,Bad,2.0

2607,i was tempted to give star based on the absence of customer support availability ive upped it to star after the chat based customer service agent did finally sort the performance is adequate i signed up for which i was expecting to be palpably better than the promise by my current bt service so far no discernible for the bits three weeks after installation and im still waiting for my home phone number to be taken over i have the temporary virgin number the installer proved how great the signal was my using the admittedly quite useful signal strength checker in the app he did this while standing next to the router unfortunately not in my upstairs office where having a working internet is to be considered fairly useful i later used the signal checker app and it confirmed i needed a booster click here to order one very good very efficient i thought err no no longer available i emailed to complain three weeks later im still waiting for a reply should i try a telephone followup that would be nice you might think that a comms company might have access to a phone line for articles and an online chat service the chat service did eventually solve the issues but it was a painful minute email rally,Bad,2.0

2610,i joined several years ago and was delighted with their customer service i loved the fact that i could get straight through on to a call centre agent that was a native english speaker i gave them positive feedback a couple of times on twitter i gradually switched all four of my family phones over to them how things have changed now like anywhere else you first have to go through menu options to reach someone and when you do get a person they are no longer native speakers i am an southerner and they seem to struggle to even understand me worst thing though is this recent system upgrade i work in it and i would have been fired if i were responsible for this i had my account set up so that i could see the bills for all four phones in my account obviously since the upgrade this is no longer possible i am told that i need separate email accounts and logins to see my bills this is ludicrous i am actually supposed to go to hotmail or wherever and get new email addresses so i can see my bills of course there is an alternative i can get paper bills if i want to pay an extra a month for each of these phones as soon as each contract is up for renewal i will be cancelling each phone and moving somewhere else,Bad,2.0

2640,i recently notified virgin of a change of address and negotiated a reduction in my monthly subscription by direct debit just over a month later at my new address my telephone tv and broadband service was unexpectedly disconnected when i contacted customer service i was informed that my services had been suspended due to an unpaid bill for the previous month when i enquired when and why my bank had declined the payment request i was told that there was no direct debit mandate in place they could not explain why my previous direct debit set up had been removed apologised for this and then set one up again i expressed my great dissatisfaction over the fact that i had not been sufficiently informed of the issue and given an opportunity to address it before being cut off no clear emails had been sent to alert me to the unpaid bill and no additional letters had been sent or even phone calls made to bring it to my attention in order to cover all communication bases i am an elderly and vulnerable individual who relies heavily on my telephone and television service and to suddenly find them cut off without adequate warning was upsetting and less than was assured that i would receive a written letter confirming that a new direct debit mandate had been set up so that the issue would not reoccur however ten days on i have yet to receive this and so i will need to contact virgin again to chase this up a very annoying and quite distressing experience,Bad,2.0

2643,despite the customer service marketing rhetoric the service really falls short of what is promised i have had two major issues that have been caused by reluctance to raise faults with bt presumably because it costs me the service was first enabled the estimated line speed was that id get mbps download once enabled i only got mbps i called to complain and they told me there was nothing i could do as it was within estimate they would not log it as a fault and told me my only option was to terminate the good fortune because my copper line didnt work before activation there was still a fault logged on bt system the local bt engineer popped by and asked if there was still a problem i explained the problem and he went to the cabinet and found high resistance on the connection he fixed it and i got the full was ok until a few weeks later when a car drove over and parked on top of the cabinet all my neighbours internet was knocked off bt sky zen etc and i had to resort to g mobile tethering access after two weeks my dsl modem was still not getting dsl sync so called zen support thinking it was going to be an easy conversation how wrong i was cue a minute heated explained what happened but the support desk person would not deviate from the script he first wanted me to check the modem cable i explained the problem with the car and the cabinet again but he insisted he had to check the modem first he suggested i replace the modem cable i said i didnt have one he said i needed to borrow one from a neighbour or buy one from a shop i said that was not an acceptable response he said he wouldnt do anything until i could prove there was no problem on my side i explained the car again the broken cabinet again the loss of internet for all my neighbours but he was adamant he would not do anything until i could prove the fault i threatened to cancel i asked to speak to sales no one would help it came to a head when he claimed that my dsl modem was faulty at this i was able to explain that as my modem was only weeks old i would be returning it to the seller as not fit for purpose the seller being zen internet at this he realised hed realised hed painted himself into a corner but still would not raise a fault with bt i asked for a new modem he said they were out of stock this was the final straw i said i was terminating immediately he put me on hold then minutes later said hed found a spare router and would be lending it me to test my linethe next day the spare router arrived can you guess what happened the new router didnt work either i called again and spoke to someone who was little more au fait with the science behind driving a ton car over a metal box they agreed that it must be a fault and raised it with bt i then had to wait another few days for bt to turn up and my staying with zen as when the service works it works well with fast upload and download if stops again ill be terminating the service rather losing my zen again just to get them to raise a fault with bt,Bad,2.0
2644,the service is actually very good when its working however i have had an open complaint for months with no reply or communication whatsoever i only wanted compensation for a month without internet but they still continue to charge me and i have no compensation they even emailed me to make a complaint through ofcom as its been so long without a reply really than that the internet speed it great now its all set up and working,Bad,2.0

2719,firstly its not fault that the conversation went the way it did it is down to the system of poor customer service in place at talk talk the on line and phone people are given a set way to deal with customers that simply places them in a loop for this particular review we will call it the loop of designed foley to make people just give up an eventually choose another supplier that will inevitably treat them the same ofcom should intervene but people dont know how to deal with them and so this conduct is going unchecked when talk talk write a new bandwidth assignment for an internet connection they constantly restrict the usage which calls for intermittent drop outs of service provided to the consumer mostly this goes unnoticed by said consumer as they do not depend upon the connection for there source of income however when you do the problem becomes entirely apparent after having issues with my talk talk assignment at my previous address i went through the circle of for a number of months they sent someone out to check the line and i gave him software to do the job better he agreed with my issues and yet the circle continued it was only after a lengthy letter giving dates names and transcripts of conversations to the correct department that my actual programme was written and the issue never again arose i have now moved address and low and behold the issues are back the very same issues and yet again the same circle of customer service has arose its not their fault its the companies fault and it needs to change,Bad,2.0

2732,my landline would not receive or make calls however the internet was working i tried to log into my account to contact talktalk but all i got was internet or password not correct fortunately the chat option worked my a pay as you go mobile would be have been unviable due to cost after hours and to different operatives all i managed to discover is that tt no longer accept existing email addresses for account services and i had to use a different email address to access my tt account and that someone would ring me back about my landline fault i found the chat process very slow and laborious and do not understand why i was required to answer more security questions when speaking to operatives i am sure that the operatives are required to use preprogrammed phrases which would explain why i was asked for the same information several times over i will avoid using this method of communication ever again unless it is as a last resort i wait to see if the call from tt gets my landline working again,Bad,2.0

for each sale they only sell the airtime agreement and not the service benefits when you take out a contract with vodafone directly you will have a postal repair facility available and also you will get the loan handset at time of repair and also you will get a warranty until your contract end i can check for any discounts which i can offer you now with my i am well aware they are third party they still have to comply to dsr sale of goods act yes thats right and its great that you aware about it however you will not be able to place your order on website particularly if you try to buy it will redirect you to a different website altogether probably mobile phones website jayne or phones uk or affordable mobiles etc which is actually a cash back company yes thats right jayne thank you for the information that i am already aware of there are many companies like that jayne did you check your best and you see they can do cheaper price than all uk not just vodafone jayne i am running out of time i will be quicker here jayne but first you need to know how third party dealers work because you see they are neither network provider nor the manufacturer of the phone so they cant provide cheaper price without any catch jayne i am aware of that i am running out of if you check it they have cheaper price than all uk network providers which includes vodafone i have also used cash back since it started over years ago what is your best deal i need to go out and i am running i can help you with the best deal available with vodafone but it will not be same as what third party dealers are offering is that okay with you jayne i am going thanks for your time you said you were checking what you could do with your manager my time and cash is important to me jayne thanks again yes i was checking and i got discount for but is not same as the deal you are looking at third party dealers website i have also asked for your number to arrange a special call back if you can provide me that we can conclude this chat right now by generating special call back jayne you know why i am not needing a call back we are going round in circles thank goodness its not a billing issue or handset issue as you have not listened to your customers needs perhaps i will get as you say a different offer through a third party on a different thanks i understand what you are asking for but i would suggest that you please understand our limitations as well they are third party dealers who remove very important services from actual service providers deals and making the price look cheaper it is obvious to get attracted by their prices even i would have too if i dont know the difference if you are okay without these important features then you can surely go ahead and place your order from them you will still get the same vodafone network jayne ohhhh dear you missed the point the discount i have is flat for the first months on the line please explain it jayne jayne the same vodafone service you are offering me when nearly mins ago you were checking the deal with your manager because all i am understanding is you are asking for the deal which on different website on

2935,this service has been reliable and there is no question that it is fast much much faster than most households need but virgin treat their customers like dirt rather than rewarding customer loyalty they penalise it by finding sly ways of putting their prices up and only matching competition if you actually try to will definitely leave as soon as my contract allows and i strongly advise against using this company unless their bandwidth is absolutely essential,Bad,2.0
2936,i have always been very wary of the large media and telecoms companies and unfortunately ee has only reinforced my perception of them as a family we had three mobile phone contracts with ee running concurrently on the positive side generally speaking the actual mobile phone service was good coverage was extensive and it rarely went off line we were also given decent upgrades of handsets when they were due on the other side of the coin the bills were on the excessive side for the package we were getting and charges which were not at all transparent would often be added additional charges outside of plan to take the monthly balance significantly over the agreed price plan on each contract it reached the point where a typical agreed price plan of per month for a specific contract were being inflated to per month things really came to a head when individual bills were going over per month and thats when i decided to terminate my custom with ee we left ee with an outstanding bills on all three contracts of a final total of which was manageable in terms of settlement with a payment plan however subsequently i received a paper invoice through the post for a final settlement of for the three contracts which included the outstanding bills plus contract cancellation fees my jaw fell to the floor on seeing this and needless to say i have entered a dispute with the company as this is beyond shocking in my view this is a cautionary tale when considering taking out a phone contract with this company beware and ensure you find out what you are getting yourself into,Bad,2.0

2938,i have been with them since and again like loyalty customers review that they only look after the new was talking to them regards to renew my contract as it has come to end but they automatically renew my contract on higher charge and removed my loyalty i spoke to them two days a go they refused to put me on my old contract and it seemed that i was talking to a robot instead of human on other was not polite at all if the company wants to treat their that way then it will not be very long before it is under liquidation,Bad,2.0

2941,updated on the day after review see really dont want to give talk talk such a bad review but i feel there is no alternative you see for several months now i have had internet connection issues the internet keeps dropping out i have done everything they say on their website to no avail i have contacted their technical team twice about the matter but something obviously gets lost in translation because they simply dont read and respond to the fault i am explaining to them they keep fixing on a wifi issue when i say to them over and over again i get the same issues with cable connected devices to the router all they want to do is sell me some morenew equipment rather than replace the faulty one they provided in the first place i do not trust their customer service team at all to put things right so will simply move my business elsewhere on the grounds that they have failed to provide the service under the terms of the agreement i recommend you avoid have updated the star rating of this review from one to two and will amend again depending on how things progress further to this review and a reply from talk talk social team i had an online chat with someone from the customer loyalty service team and had a very different experience firstly they were very attentive and read and understood everything i had to say secondly they have implemented steps to try and resolve the issue without charging me for it after all this currently seems to be a fault with the service they provide either line or still stand by what i said about the technical service and ill add another point to my original review in that the online chat took forever with huge gaps between me writing and their response i get the feeling the person i was dealing with was also dealing with several other customers at the same timethe person today has promised replacement equipment is going to be shipped out to me which will either solve the problem if it is a router issue or because it is a better router will help them find the issue and resolve it when it arrives and i have had time to check the internet i will come back and update this review again,Bad,2.0

2972,loyalty means nothing anymore this is not just about the constant price increases by vodafone but more to do with their nonexistent customer are the days of being able to speak to a human being will find you in an endless cycle of use our online chat option and even the online chat is like pulling teeth so service down two to go before vodafone is squarely in my rear view mirror and its a shame as they are reliable as a network and broadband provider which is the only reason for an extra star,Bad,2.0

3006,if virgin actually offered old customers the same deals they do to new customers they might be more respected instead they take old customers for granted increasing their bills their business model is exploitative and assumes customers have no comparable alternative they joining of virgin with old providers with their awful reputation doesnt promise much for the future the speed of internet is okay but frankly after a certain level of mbs is achieved increases are negligible,Bad,2.0
3007,i tried to sign up for new broadband via a cashback site but it wouldnt accept my email address because it said it was associated with a previous talktalk account which was true but i hadnt been with them for several years why this should be a problem im not sure unless they are convinced that once people leave talktalk they wont phoned up to try and get them to delete the email address and this caused all sorts of problems after being on the phone for minutes and batted back and forth between customer service and technical services i gave up and put in a different email address they said that they couldnt delete the email address as it was associated with an inactive account im not sure this complies with eu data protection policies i then got a phone call back to say they had deleted me fingers crossed,Bad,2.0

3010,stars because the service worked most of the time and the speed was as advertised but thats where the good news the service goes down which it has several times the reporting system on their site is very unclear often says there is no issue in the area even if they subsequently tell you there was an issue and its now been resolved arranging for an engineer to come out was very glitchy on the site clicking unresponsive buttons over and over service is the worst ive ever encountered really unimaginably bad they have purposefully made it extremely difficult to contact them to cancel your contract hours on hold to speak to someone and then the line cutting out when i finally managed to interact with someone on the text chat service i had to ask them times over a period of around minutes to cancel my contract and was offered a different deal the first times despite being very clear i wasnt interested right from the outset its hard to imagine this is anything other than intentional to make people give up and prevent them from leaving complained to i understand why people sign up because often they are the only full fibre provider but i am so happy to have the option of several others in my area now avoid if at all possible,Bad,2.0

3013,just had my t box upgraded and two t boxes replaced with mini boxes i have just lost tb of storage as the mini boxes rely on the t the t has to be on for me to use the others waste of what i am most unhappy about is the god awful menu channel guide which is so inferior to the previous one what is more every time i press channel down you throw up an advert for something at the bottom of the screen so if i scroll thru i get adverts it is terrible who designed it you need to sack them,Bad,2.0

3123,broadband internet and phone a miserable experience swapped to virgin from an adsl provider and hugely regret it speeds are great when the service is up but ive seen frequent outages during my two years as a customer where adsl was faultless all the while the prices keep increasing customer service is dire they are ruthless with their contracts and any change will land you with a hefty bill at the end of my contract i was refused when asking for a downgrade in service to try and lower my monthly outgoings before an imminent house move their only solution sign up to another two year contract no thanks ive heard from family and friends that as a final treat to come when i close out the account i will be chased after for the return of old equipment handled in the most manner possible if you dont need superfast albeit unreliable broadband speeds then i would reccomend you avoid this company,Bad,2.0

3133,not happy with these guys ive spent hours trying to get service reinstated and all the first operators want me to do is upgrade my service rather than fix the problem after several disconnections i was finally served by individuals who spent time and did the right thing and hopefully sorted the problem efficiently and wonder if the policy is to interfere with your service and then tell you all will be well if you upgrade maybe im too cynical but thats what it feels like,Bad,2.0
3134,instead giving all these stupid offer dont charge us an extra a a month nobody wants,Bad,2.0
3135,personally i think if you want to go on o because of signal choose they also run on o and the customer service is way better i was initially on three and chose o based on the pay as you go and i thought o would have better customer service than three ha both are equally the same initially i moved using cashback but because i kept my number o denied my cashback reviewed this and resent the claim but o said i cancelled my order this wasnt spoke to different people as there was issues porting my number across one said my claim would be passed and id get a call in a few days i didnt i spoke to the th person demanding to speak to a manager as i was fed up this person basically read a script it was so shocking in the end i got off them in credit from the issues and many weeks of waiting now the credits running out im moving to under vodafone go look at reviews on here stars,Bad,2.0
3136,i bought a reconditioned phone which came with a sim card the sim card didnt work for some unknown reason i wasted hours trying to get the bloody thing to work there was no direct support from anyone all i could do was to leave a message hours later you replied stating the problem was the sim card and recommended i get a replacement days later the new sim card arrived and i set the phone up overall a pretty annoying experience that could have been avoided with some quality control in the first instance,Bad,2.0

3140,i was very disappointed lately with your service because in the last months we had major disruptions that lasted days on weekends both times and even if i was told that this would have been taken out of my bill it didnt happen and no explanation came its not nice as customers service goes as still i couldnt work or use my broadband both times from friday till late those days so i am going to have a look for a more trustworthy company because hiding behind the length of days as some agent told the missed broadband it doesnt make you proud and,Bad,2.0

3142,honestly it would be a lot higher if it wasnt for the fact that they refuse to correct their misspelling of my name and address when i signed up i told them i live in a flat they said oh its fine it doesnt come up but doesnt matter how can it not matter that you havent put my flat number been trying to change it for months they said they changed my name but they havent as it still shows up incorrectly spelled on all correspondents i receive from them ive been trying to get volt benefits from o as ive been a customer with them for years but i cant why because virgin has spelt my name and address wrong when i tried to call last time to fix it their representative just tried to get me to sign up for a new be stars if it wasnt for this crap ive had to deal with for months as the internet is a lot faster and consistent than my previous provider,Bad,2.0
3143,we are always losing connection i have made a few of online complaints before but never hear anything back the only reason this company is still getting my money is because the last year has made it harder to change when i find a reliable company i will be leaving most definitely would not recommend virgin,Bad,2.0
3144,we chose virgin media because it boasts high speeds for internet which is accurate but service is very rarely available as i write this in my house i am not even using my expensive virgin media internet i am in fact using my phone providers g data because once again we have no internet to our router i regularly get text messages saying we are doing works in your area so our internet doesnt work all day good job we dont work from home because quite frankly it would be impossible terrible provider the maintenance guy who originally visited to fit our box was also very rude i felt like he misogynistic towards me would never ever recommend virgin media useless waste of money,Bad,2.0
3145,having specified that the purpose of the conversation was to cancel my account and having been told that it was not possible to do so over the phone as talktalk has no phone number reachable from outside the uk i then spent an hour with long delays between chat messages only to be told that i needed to be transferred to another department this was despite being assured at the offset that the person i was communicating with would be able to assist me a complete waste of time,Bad,2.0

3147,weve recently moved our package over to the volt bundle the agent who dealt with our contract renewal offered us a total figure inclusive of the o sim it was only upon being billed that we realised we were being charged an additional from o each month apparently the agents earn a commission for getting people onto the new volt bundle so they fail to mention crucial details like this to encourage people to sign up we even asked whether we would be charged separately from o before agreeing to which the agent told us we wouldnt ive contacted virgin times about this now on each occasion ive been passed around the billing team customer services and the team each one not having the authority to rectify the initial agents mistake im waiting yet again for my bill to come through to see whether any changes have been made before i inevitably have to spend hours on the phone to them to try and fix it again the only reason they get stars is because they generally offer speeds that nobody else can match however since upgrading to their hub weve been facing more difficulties with regards to the ghz channels i would recommend sticking with the hub until these are issued as standard to all customers,Bad,2.0

3150,we are us citizens relocated to london for a year we signed up for bt in early july and then they cancelled our service until july for some reason unknown to us the tv package would not work so they sent us additional equipment that did not work at an additional cost sent out a repairman who helped get internet channels hooked up but said we needed an internal aerial to get free channels purchased that at an additional cost still didnt work bt sent out another repairman who specialized in aerials he told us we cant get the service without the significant additional cost of adding an external aerial he recommended freesat wish someone had told us about it to begin with purchased freesat box get great channels called to cancel the tv portion of my bt package only to be told sorry its not their fault that we cant get their channels so we have to continue to pay monthly or pay significant cost to cancel contract ridiculous the television department representatives are absolutely the most unhelpful i have ever encountered you cant understand them they ask questions that make no sense and when you cant understand and ask for clarification they treat you like you are stupid i will be sure to recommend to all us citizens coming to london to never sign up for bt,Bad,2.0

3154,great service in the gainsborough useless service from the phone head office,Bad,2.0
3155,far to many departments that deal with different things and it seems like there is no cross referencing of ongoing issues or works customers from the same development all on bt are getting conflicting and inaccurate reports a very frustrating experience when reporting faults or getting any updates one silver lining is an operative called kieron who took extra effort to try and resolve the bt system issues and take the issue to management a very helpful guy but overall bts services are frustrating for an end user,Bad,2.0
3156,ordered a like new phone for my sons birthday it was so scraped down the sides no way was it like new very disappointing and then none in stock so couldnt replace,Bad,2.0
3157,while the service works it is fine and there are some very good deals out there however the mission statement about existing customers being able to move onto a better deal if they see one is very rarely achieved if the better deal is available on a third party site and includes a boost that you already have you have to remove the boost first and risk losing whatever baseline broadband deal you are currently on while chasing the better deal sometimes one might save over a year with one of these nuanced offers but it is probably not worth the risk of losing the deal you are on and wasting hours of your life on chat trying to get it matched very unfair that some customers are succeeding with this very process while others get it turned down it depends how much you value your own time whether you bother becoming embroiled with this rd may i followed the link for a formal reply and it just took me back to the option of chat etc which is where i had been before talktalk you have all my details already and all the details of the conversation with my account notes you knocked off early this evening so i was not able to follow up and i will not be wasting further time on this in future my current contract expires in august when i will have plenty of time to explore the option of changing provider i am utterly fed up with your chat assistants not matching publicised deals while giving them to a few lucky people as reported on your community forum,Bad,2.0

3160,i have been told that this review has been listed against bt shop not bt online the review is about the online service not the shop i can honestly say that the customer service provided by bt is probably the worst i have ever experienced i have no complaint with the staff on the phone as they are polite and try to be helpful but have to adhere to the policy set down by bt i am now tied to a contract with bt however it was one of the biggest mistakes i have ever made do not trust the adverts or the promises made online you will find that they have very good clauses in the tcs so that when things go wrong they can claim it is down to their suppliers and wash their hands of any problems,Bad,2.0
3161,i have spent over hours chatting to advisors of them trying to get access to my mobile phone account i am able to access my account but nothing of mobiles would appear that no one apart from the accounts department knows that i have a mobile account with phones as i continue to get bills but cannot see the to be typical of talktalk that any problem seems to take forever to resolve,Bad,2.0
3162,looking at these reviews i regret making a snap judgement and joining this company for my was miss sold my broadband package on my doorstep i was told by the woman who sold me it that i got a few months free and then a set rate of a month but after on a couple of months that went up to when i contacted talktalk they couldnt have cared less just told me that everything was in the tcs obviously i should have read those however you should never be sold something different in person to what is in the add to this my first payment was due out around christmas time and unfortunately i got scammed and ended up struggling not only to pay the first bill but also struggled to buy christmas presents i informed them what had happened and they still stuck on a admin fee and they have found ways to add extra fees ever since they added a extra payment for using data this wasnt part of my package and ive never used their data i was told this fee would be waived last month but it didnt get removed and still hasnt been removed this in all this is a very untrustworthy company and im regretfully locked into a contract with them im weighing up the price of buying out of the contract because knowing these they will find ways to add that much extra on for nothing that it will work out cheaper to buy out of the contract as it stands i wouldnt recommend going with talktalk to anyone because of their customer service the only reason they are getting two stars instead of one is because their broadband actually works well just a shaming their customer service is severely lacking,Bad,2.0
3163,operator was unable to assist me or inform me as to whether the internet service had been reinstated,Bad,2.0
3164,i wish i got the speed i paid for shame and speed drops although nothing wrong with my router so technical support keeps telling me dont get me started the month contract i was sold which is a month so all in all cant wait to change provider but im told its upto thats anything between and mb not very accurate then i think all these providers should be made to provide what they say,Bad,2.0
3165,been a customer for years had some frustrations at times with issues but normally sorted after phone calls some of which are far more lengthy than they ever needed to be the thing that annoys me the most is the constant cat mouse game you to play when your contract is coming to an end to offer the exact same service to new customers at that i am currently paying more for to be then told that i wont be able to have the very same services for less then and that is with an offer applied is just insulting i normally play the game do the bartering and get a price in the same region but again always more than the new customer deals but i have had enough now when i can get somebody to answer the phone again ill be giving my days the husband can sign up as a new customer instead,Bad,2.0

3173,the broadband is terrible we originally paid for the mb oomph but once ordered we were only told by the installation guy that our area told us it was max mb and you are lucky if you get anywhere near it they say that there is over mb going to box outside on wall so in their eyes all is ok so the hub must be terrible as even with a virgin booster the kids in their bedrooms are lucky to get up to mbs try ringing them you will be on hold for hours no help whatsoever once the contract is up i will be leaving as will quite a few i know sorry but what it says on the tin you dont get,Bad,2.0

3177,i have long wondered why i bothered with talk talk i had a terrible experience a few years ago when the company supplied my broadband two weeks offline and tortuous and torturous calls to call centres in india africa and more until i finally convinced them to send an engineer he was baffled too but it turned out to be a loose connection at my local exchange that was solved in minutes by open reach though they are not great either have since changed broadband service to highly recommended however for some reason that i now regret hugely i carried on with talk talk running my other phone line i now wish to close that account and it has already turned into another torture tt wants my email account to identify me but they never had one and admitted the fact via live chat nevertheless their operative has asked me for that email address so that they can reset the password i escape talk talk im not sure i have the will or the stamina,Bad,2.0

3180,i placed my new customer order online for broadband and phone and everything was fine until i got a bit that i wanted some confirmation on i phoned the call centre to be answered by luke who i asked if he could answer my fairly simple question he then proceeded to ask me lots of questions in return and it became quite obvious that he was setting me up with a new customer account which i had just done for myself online when i queried why he was doing this and not just answering my query he became quite argumentative apparently the calls are recorded i hope so this is how not to win customers,Bad,2.0
3181,i needed to edit my review to star because of wasted chasing them up i believed they are better than other provider and proved me wrong as part of new contract the loyalty team offered amazon voucher and wifi extender because of poor network upstairs however none arrived i tried calling them few times and every time different were few mishaps re network connectivity and contract the customer service team loyalty team and technical team were very help they took my call very seriously and they do follow up on the issue as they promise and aim to resolve the issue and keep up the expectations i would say well done and keep up,Bad,2.0

3185,my package was migrated to talktalk after the company i was with went into administration talktalk honoured the rolling monthly contract which was good of them when it came to cancelling my order i did this online and the agent was very helpful the reason i have rated talktalk with stars is down to the technical issues i have had and the communication during those times i had a repeat of the issue almost immediately after the first time and once more towards the end of my contract on the last time i did not contact them as i could not face the of the various phone calls and instead waited it out for days until the issue resolved itself if talktalk arrange a callback with you they will not call you back at the agreed time if the fault is found to be external to your property they will still charge you an engineer visit of and you will need to argue your case to get a refund if you get any technical issue my advice is to make a chronological history with of every step of the troubleshooting process every conversation get every agents name etc because it will help a lot during the process it was something i did not do but will do so from now on with any future provider make sure to check your bill every month,Bad,2.0

3194,i have had to make some calls to virgin to sort out my package but the representatives sound so fed up that this is not doing this company any good and this stems from poor management observations on staff and listening to the calls later from this a question should pop up if that was me on the end of that phone what would you think you might have a good database of customers but unless management is either changed or shaken up customers will be a thing that disappears and once a customer goes the damage is to see a reply but it does not take a comfy chat to sort this issue with customer service see the many reviews yes sometimes when a customer does not get what they want then a bad review follows but every case has two sides too it only by listening to the calls relating to each complaint either backs it up or what has been reported by the customer is incorrect the relevant correction posted by the business management but with virgin the internal issues are just left to go on,Bad,2.0

3285,appalling wifi signal even after several attempts to get a technician to come and it too expensive once discounts run out data entered online to manage account is not synced up with the data the customer service agents are access to when we call them eg i updated my email address for my account online a month before i got in touch with virgin by phone and they had the original email address that had been provided when opening the account years ago impossible to cancel subscription online you have to get in touch with someone or fill in forms without any confirmation of time it will take a bit tricky when they insist in providing days notice when you want to cancel customer service online chatbot service is hit and miss depending on when you use it and for which reason i imagine i contacted them to cancel my subscription virgins opening times are am until pm monday to friday and saturday sunday am until pm examples below started conversation with chatbot on a monday at uk that redirected me to a whatsapp conversation where i was promised typically we will respond to your query within hours and well notify you when you connect to an agent i only heard back in the morning of tuesday at am asking if i still needed assistance i replied at and they then replied at transferring me to an agent conversation started on chatbot on monday at saying i am moving home chatbot asks you info name email account number etc no reply until the morning after asking if i still needed help calls to call center conversation on the phone very little waiting time information captured automatically before being put through to the agent but all info had to repeated as customer agent could not see any of the information i had inputted very strong scottish accent that made it hard to understand maybe because i am french it makes it harder but nice agent very strong attempts to keep you as a customer and offering speed improvement technician etc years ago i had told myself i would never returned to virgin but did eventually as it was the best signal in the area looks like they are using their positions to get their customers hence not finding it necessary to provide a good customer service what a shame to take advantage of customers like info i was on the m fibre broadband and was paying gbp per month gbp while the lasted,Bad,2.0

3373,ive said it before the so called loyalty approach to their customers just doesnt work with talktalk despite my comments on needing to sacrifice my telephone number to get the same deal offered to new customers in an earlier trustpilot review i thought i would give it one last chance to negotiate a special loyalty deal using their web chat this was after receiving a paper letter encouraging me to do so by telephone but i wanted a record of what was said i was cut off twice the first was possibly not their fault but the second was after minutes chatting after waiting minutes with me actually typing she was off i was disconnected and what was talktalk response to my trustpilot to sacrifice my telephone number to get the same deal offered to new customers in an earlier trustpilot review to login to the community and waste another hour no doubt,Bad,2.0

3383,first of all of like to say that the ps arrived on time and as expected i found the process of placing the order painful having to find and copy a code from one system to another i checked the order after placing it and all seemed fine not sure why i needed a security check but hey ho the follow on process displayed looked fine after a day or so i passed the security check and the follow on status changed to no stock or awaiting stock from supplier i emailed in a query but was told the email address i was using did not match my by shop id so i changed the email address on by shop id but was repeatedly told it did not match after a few days the stock was allocated and all was good from that point i think the problem lies within th by systems i suspect that the email address debate is because by has more than one customer system one for the shop and one for phone customers that and the poor information displayed when viewing the order mean i think but has work to do in considering the online customer experience,Bad,2.0
3384,overall virgin media continues to feel like a service where you hate yourself for staying with them yet the options to move to another provider seem equally as bad they do the same every year fantastic deals to reel new customers in yet deals that are appealing for loyal customers internet speed when it works it works tv and phone package is standard and basic tv is appallingly bad a virgin representative called me last week to say that virgin wanted to reward me for being a loyal customer i said at the beginning if this was a call requesting that i agree to a deal that requires more money then i am not interested she said this was not the case minutes later she has rattled through a fantastic sounding new deal and then gives me a price that is more than what i am on quick check on the virgin website shows the same deal is cheap as chips for new customers i really do feel that the customers that have been with virgin for a while are paying for these cheap virgin care for existing customers i dont think so,Bad,2.0

3391,the quality of the broadband and tv service we receive is very good no complaints with i find the assumption that an existing customer could only be looking at the web site to upgrade and spend more money extremely annoying and to force a customer who wants to downgrade and spend less money call in to the call centre to do it even more so it feels like youre being pushed to take more and more and spend more and more and it gives the impression virgin sees you as nothing more than a cash cow not a human being with needs and worries and problems and whose circumstances might have changed since they first signed up i dont want to waste my time on the phone listening to music playing for ages while i wait on hold just to have a person try to talk me out of downgrading and take even more services and spend more money instead why cant i just downgrade online as easily as i can upgrade they cant say its because of the contract because the contract has expired and i havent renewed it nor will ii am so annoyed by this that i am looking to change providers,Bad,2.0

3456,who says that you cannot get things corrected in the ende save have written to o and the black mark is removed after many more calls and letters we finally got o to accept a letter from that stated we did nothing wrong we never agreed to a contract at what i can gather the temp staff at e save made up the contract in our name this was probably for the extra bonus they can earn when they sell more save what a flawed system you have just asking for temp staff to rip people off and make up sales noone apart from the sales person knows of and as they are temps they can get out before they are found out oh and as a side note you cannot take to the financial ombudsman about having your credit rating damaged by them as according to the ombudsman your debt with them is from a third party so because you did not take out the contract with them it was done via a third party on your behalf so you actuary have no recourse to get anything done except hope as in our case o will actually do the right finally thanks for repairing our credit rating by removing a debt for a contract that we never the only thing to do is refuse all sales calls straight away and hope they do not blight you anyway by signing you up without your knowledge and you wont have to waste a year of your time fighting to get it put right so for finally doing the right thing i upgrade you to two stars who wont do anything about a debt that they have put against my wife for a contract via e save that we never had any knowledge of after it was paid by e save so lets get into the seems that e save who are part of carphone warehouse who can sign you up for a contract without your knowledge they then take months to listen to the calls and admit in their words you were miss sold and because they cannot pay for their directly they pay you and you pay my wife was out of contract but did not want another phone yet as she had not decided what phone she wanted so she carried on and paid the each month to cover her calls as she had done for months when in contract and when she decided to upgrade she found to her horror that she was in a contract she had no knowledge of and had been for almost the lying deceitful thieves at e save saga can read this if you search the review below save what a bunch of lying deceitful fraudulent the e save saga goes only did someone there sign my wife up for a contract without her knowledge and after yes months of writing and urging them to actually listen to the calls did they finally state that she was in their words the contract and they would pay the outstanding monies to o oddly they could not do this directly and instead sent us the money directly to my wifes account and we had to pay the money arrived and we paid the very next sorted so we on another year and we find out that as e save had taken so long to listen to the calls and admit that they were in the wrong months to admit and send the money they also did not bother to inform that it was their error and not ours and that is why we were in disagreement with e save so had without our knowledge put a black mark on my wifes credit score but it took them months to do this after they were paid it states paid in full but still shows as a will e save who have admitted that they set up the contract without our knowledge not put this e save supply me with the details of their legal department so that my unions solicitors will know who it is i will be taking to court for defamation of character and damages to reputation which was unblemished until they set up a contract that we knew nothing emails below but these stopped when e save started to ring us rang them and they promised to listen to the recorded phone calls and get back to her twice this failed promise has happened since then we have written as follows on the th feb was out of contract with o last september then the phone calls upgrades etc i did not want another phone so instead went for a monthly pay as you go no contract with i want a new phone and when i ring o they tell me i am with the carphone warehouse and they tell me i am with somehow my monthly no contract is in fact a month contract and not with oi want to know how they can blatantly lie to people and sign you up for a contract that you have never discussed or have no knowledge ofi await the email of the exact wording that was used in the phone call that they say i are you and how can you blatantly lie to e save write the following the th feb hello you for your review im sorry to hear the service youve received has been poor all our calls are recorded and we will investigate that i can investigate and put things right please could you provide your order id so i can i can look into the account and call youi look forward to hearing from support at e save guess what if you actually read our words and thought before your condescending stupid answering you would realise that no order was ever placed so guess what no order id is known to us as we placed no do what you promised now times and listen to your call and find we are like thousands of others who your company has lied to and misled by signing them into contracts they know nothing how do we tell you my wifes phone number without informing the whole from july hello understand why you wish to display your wifes phone number on a public forum without this i am unable to locate the i would kindly ask your wife to contact our customer support team on so that we are able to investigate the issues you have for any inconvenience or upset sorry to hear that your wife hasnt received the call backs as promised and that she has recently discovered that she is in a month contract i understand the concern and frustration this would that we can look into this can you please provide us with the mobile number that the contract is for and we will contact you to discuss this a few more calls and another few weeks have gone by they admit that no contract was agreed and they will pay the outstanding balance to close the cannot do this directly but will send the money to my wifes account by transfer and we can pay the money to guess who to close the account we never

3893,ive used bt internet my whole life bt have always given us decent service and value for money up until six weeks ago when we started having problems with our broadband weve been on fibre optic for a good few years now and weve enjoyed fast speeds and good connections but i started to notice our internet speeds slowing down around the beginning of april consistently as well i waited for a few days to see if the speeds would recover but they never did i lodged a formal complaint on april th to which the person i spoke with through the online chat service said they had found a fault near the exchange and were going to send an engineer to investigate i was told my internet would be back to normal within a week or so they were nearly two more weeks i decided to get back in touch with bt as our internet hadnt improved at all this time the person i spoke with told me that they had found a fault with our hardware i questioned why they hadnt found this fault the first time around to which the person could not give a specific answer i shrugged it off and waited for the new home hub bt smart hub to arrive after another week the hub hadnt arrived so i got back in touch with bt and they told me that they had failed to send it they apologised and sent one promptly which arrived a couple of days later i noticed a delivery charge of was also added to our bill something else they failed to mention installed the new hub gave it a few days and lo and behold the internet was still playing up with its slow speeds and intermittent connection i got back in touch with bt yet again and they failed to identify the issue saying they needed to send another engineer to have a look i told them one already came to which they informed me that the first engineer visit to identify the problem outside of the house was cancelled by this point i was obviously getting frustrated at how incompetent these people were being the second engineer arrived and told us that he found no fault outside of the house he ran tests inside and claimed our connections were all as they should be we should be receiving maximum speeds he changed the master socket to a brand new one just in case and went on his way a week later and still no improvement another engineer came out and managed to identify an issue at the telephone pole something the first engineer failed to see and promptly scaled the pole to fix it after this our internet seemed to pick up we were getting our regular mbps download speeds with a solid connection that was a week agoi woke up this morning nd may to check my emails and do some work and to my not so surprised surprise our speeds were at a lightning fast pace of mbps this whole facade has been going on for almost weeks and our internet is still no better off than before each and every person i speak with seem to have absolutely zero knowledge of my case i have to explain myself to them over and over again each time i want to get in contact with customer service thats when i do manage to sit through minute wait times on the phone the workers in the customer service department are hopeless they cannot identify issues and send you links to bts help page on their website and consider that a solution they pass you from team to team person to person without actually giving you any kind of useful solution or information in the process and always say we will contact you within the week to follow up with a solution something which never ever happens all they do is send emails apologising i cannot believe how bad bts customer service is ive never had any real issues with them and so all of the complaints i thought were over exaggerated but i was wrong the complaints people have against this company are fully justified they are hopeless at helping you but pretty damn efficient at taking your money absolutely shambolic service bad customer helpline with no real effort to meet customer satisfaction the only reason im giving them two stars is because this is the only real major issue ive had its just a shame its such a big one,Bad,2.0

3969,i have not had to contact o too many times over the years i have been a customer of their but any time there has been a problem they are a nightmare to deal main issue with them is lack of support and the fact that if you have a faulty handset rather than getting a new replacement you will get a refurbishment i had several problems with a sony ericsson phone it simply would not switch on one day and this was within months of buying the phone after spending hours on the phone to various people i was finally sent a replacement this broke after a day with same problem again another phone call to o another replacement sent this one broke with the same problem so this vicious circle went on and on i believe from memory i went through different phones all of which suffered the same time i contacted them i asked to a new phone to be sent not a refurbishment i was told this could not be done i spoke to several managers this all fell upon deaf ears i asked for them to cancel my contract if they could not supply me with a working handset bearing in mind part of my monthly bill was including the cost of the handset so effectively i was paying for a product that was not fit for purpose when asking to have my contact cancelled i was told it was not possible i was then told if i wanted to do that i would have to pay upfront for the remained of the month contract not even a year into the current one at that the end i gave up trying to contact o and asking for a replacement only to be sent a refurbishment that did not work either so i put my sim card in an old phone and put up with that until the contact came to an end i also forgot to mention that they charged me for sending out a replacement phone even though they had the one i returned this was put right after a few have been an o customer for many years infarct i have never used another company it would appear as though none of this matters to them i stupidly went back to them again months ago to extend my contract and to get an iphone the phone itself is fine but the coverage is terrible not only that but now its up for renewal there are no good deals to being offered to me even after all this time i think maybe its time to switch providers,Bad,2.0

3980,when your bills go up and this is the best we can offer is repeated to you over and over its rather frustrating to spend time selecting another provider then going through to the disconnection team only to get a better price than what was in offer to begin when you make some sacrifices and go out and get a new sim card for child number weeks later you receive a call and offer an even better service including a sim card that you couldnt offer anymore i now have a pay monthly sim card sitting in the cupboard doing nothing and slightly better the plus side the new router creates a lovely back light behind the tall unit thanks,Bad,2.0

4202,like others here on trustpilot i was attracted by the excellent review by which unfortunately im disappointed the changeover from bt was not smooth i had to work from home without broadband for a second day while the engineer turned up to fix the problem whilst i understand that this was not fault my contract is with zen and i think it is reasonable of me to expect them to ensure that they get good service from their suppliers and reduce preventable issues the next problem was with wifi and this is ongoing for some reason the zen support engineer seemed to take glee in pointing out to me that the supplied by zen was only an entry level router and not as powerful as the one i had with bt changing channels didnt fix the problem i currently have an ethernet wire trailing across my living room floor in order to be able to download iplayer content on my tv without dropouts my living room is a fairly average size and the is in the same room the solution from my most recent support call was to dig out my old wifi router from the attic,Bad,2.0

4254,below is the email i sent to the customer service yesterday august th i pasted their appalling reply at the end of the have been a costumer for a very long night at am i received a text informing me that the national plus online bundle was successfully renewed and this morning i noticed that i was charged from my bank account without having ever received a reminder of any sort about the expiration of my previous bundle nor about the incoming have always received a reminder via text by to hours before the expiration of the bundle prompting me to top up my account for its renewal and informing me of what i needed to do with my account this time this has not occurred and i can either send you a screenshot of the texts i received in their chronological order or you could easily verify this on your enda few hours ago i called the customer service to let you know that i did not need the bundle nor to top up my phone with as i am travelling and have already paid for a different sim card to use i told the customer service agent that i had not received any reminder this time as its always been the case with and of the odd time i was informed at of this renewal which did not allow me to switch off the roaming on my phone on time to avoid incurring in any unwanted the phone i was told that since i have used more or less mb out of the gb allowance of the bundle the money could not be reimbursed to my bank account but that i could be credited on my account instead i sincerely appreciated the time taken by the agent to investigate my case and explain to me what since i have never received any written evidence via email or post saying that i signed up for an subscription that would take the money straight from my bank account rather than from my account and that the renewal itself occurred at a different time than when i purchased the last bundle on july th a very inconvenient time for anybody to take action on that matter i kindly request the reimbursement of to my bank account to be processed as soon as have already called my bank to request a stop of the transaction which led me to write you this formal complain about how i was unexpectedly charged without ever been informed in a written form of what was going to errors on side are listed below there is no written evidence in terms of text email or post that informed me the customer of a monthly subscription that would be paid straight from my bank account the option is automatically ticked while purchasing the bundle rather than asking the customer in an honest manner if they would be happy with this type of service did not send me the customer any reminder in any possible form of the expiration of the bundle and the incoming charge contrary to the service i received and enjoyed during the last few years if i the customer rely on a long and established honest clear communication with a mobile service provider which has always informed me well in advance on every action taken on my account it is a duty of the provider itself to inform the customer beforehand that in this specific occasion the text reminder service will be suspended the renewal did not occur at the same time the last bundle was purchased which was on july th at pm central european summer time cest but at am cest making it impossible to deal promptly with the matter therefore i incurred in the unwanted use of data service the use of approximately mb of data during the time between the unexpected renewal of the bundle and my call to the customer service a few hours later cannot be considered a plausible reason to deny the reimbursement requested as mb represents a mere of the total bundles allowance of gb having neither made nor received any call since the renewal of the new bundle would gladly avoid asking my bank to block any future transaction from my bank account to as i still intend to use my sim card after this period of given the blatant unfairness of my case i wont have any other alternative than to do so if the reimbursement will not be processed as the circumstances of my case clearly highlight a striking inadequacy of the communication system used by for what concerns the agreement behind the of the am more than confident that my case will help the team ensuring that what occurred to me will not represent an issue for any other customer enjoying its mobile is answer which was received via started using the bundle allowance hence we are unable to deactivate the didnt even address me with my own name which was at the end of the email nor they provided any other explanation for all the other points i highlighted in my email i am shocked i wish i had never used and suggested their service to other customers will not stop i received a phone call on the very same day i posted my complain on friday august th the customer care agent ensured me that a refund would have been processed within the following to business days she posted a reply to my complain on trustpilot too dear are sorry about the inconvenience experienced in reference to our telephonic conversation we are processing your refund request by cancelling the current bundle and we will also keep your updated on the progress thank no refund so far and i have never been kept posted on wednesday august th i received two different emails from two different customer care agents the first one informing me that the refund could not be processed because the bundle has been used the core of my complain and the second email saying that the system showed that the option was selected by me the customer opposite on what is written on their website they made no reference to the reply to my complain posted on trustpilot by the i even started feeling utterly fooled by lack of internal communication and hypocrisy i received a request from trustpilot itself which is pasted below just read your review and theyd like to learn more about your experience but first they need help finding you in their customer me i was called directly by an agent straight after i posted my complain i shared my personal details and phone number both via email and trustpilot over this issue several times they replied to me on trustpilot addressing me with my name which they must have taken from the conversation over the phone the mobile number or the emails sent to their customer i took the opportunity to reply to them through the trustpilot request for more information i let them know about the emails i received on august th including the names and surnames of the agents who sent me those emails i told them i did not receive my refund but business days had not passed yet so i would have still waited for it expecting nevertheless a clarification on the amount of alarming misinformation they were spreading from their customer care private are glad that your request for refund has been successfully resolved and it has been our pleasure resolving it with all your timely feedback we are sorry to hear about your initial experience with and we are happy that we were able to turn it into a satisfying experience after that we take on board your precious feedback as its

misinformation issue generated by their customer service and they did not keep what promised on a public platform nor over the phone yet they are asking me to reconsider my earlier review on which basis i should do so remains a am speechless and extremely upset i will report this to my bank as an evidence of lack of professionalism abuse of customers trust and i hope my case will help other customers to call directly on their banks to block any financial activity related to operations rather than losing precious time dealing with its highly incompetent customer service management team and their empty public and private will flag this severe case of customer care negligence and dishonesty on every social media platform and will keep updating my review on trustpilot as i gather more

4275,i have had virgin broadband and home phone for just under three years at different addresses the broadband itself has generally worked very well at the promised speed and reliably with very few outages all good however the sales and customer service teams are the worst i have ever encountered for example the sales team attempted to increase the cost of the package from what i had seen advertised online when i questioned this pointing out the web page on which the cost was advertised the explanation was that their system hadnt been updated with new deals yet yeah right when my contract has come up for renewal the proposed price increases have been huge more than on the existing cost discussions with the renewals team have involved lengthy and repeated periods of sitting on the phone in silence while the sales person checks with their manager before dropping the price by a couple of quid its only after half an hour of this game playing that ive eventually been put through to the team for a sensible discussion about the price customer service is equally horrendous my first call to them today was hung up before being answered on the second goi was transferred to a non existent department with a recorded voice telling me to call again ive stayed with virgin broadband because they are the only high speed service in my street however that changes very soon and i will certainly be looking at alternatives,Bad,2.0

4328,constant disconnects and slow speed price jumped from to now they are putting it up to called to cancel and it took minutes the woman kept offering discounts and asking if my sister will be arranging a new contract with virgin i said why would i cancel with you to go back to you everytime i questioned something she said because of her strong accent she just repeated the same thing again,Bad,2.0

4333,please do not go with you do the service ive faced trying yes trying to get broadband in at home has been nothing short of shocking placed the order for the broadband and home phone to be installed on tuesday june th this was all came to install on time to his credit although he was from kelly communications and not bt themselves so that may be why however i dont need about five email and text reminders per day for the week leading up to the engineer coming im perfectly aware of remembering this detail extremely annoying also i dont understand why unlike virgin the engineer is incapable of bringing the broadband router with them at point of installation normally you would pay for the privilege of said engineer to come and tinker with an already installed socket so this isnt asking too much surely which leads on to the next issue i had namely that two routers were sent out and both vanished without trace en route i spoke to an advisor about the first one who i believe was named poonam and had to escalate to a manager because his behaviour was very aggressive and rude towards me and he seemed unconcerned about a legitimate customer complaint the manager did to his credit resolve things to my satisfaction at the time and had the foresight to offer the router to be delivered to my work address unlike poonam who was next to useless cue friday june th when id requested the replacement router to be delivered to my work address yup you guessed it it was sent to my home address despite me asking otherwise i then contact who state that the parcel had been left in a safe place but they were unable to inform me where on top of this i receive a bill on the same day three days after my service supposedly started which i havent even been able to use thanks to the general incompetence of this company i then contact bt who are once again rude and dismissive so then request to be put through to the cancellations team here i spoke to a gentleman i use that term loosely called phil who is without a doubt the worst customer service operative i have ever had the misfortune to speak to i have previously worked in customer service myself so i know what behaviours are acceptable or otherwise and phil seems out to break every rule in the manual he doesnt even apologise for the inconvenience and problems faced by myself he is once again rude and dismissive you see a pattern here and in fact resorts to telling me off like i am some kind of child he spent most of the call talking over me yet had the nerve to tell me to stop talking over him and to stop taking that tone with me when i am understandably upset by the entire experience to my credit i did attempt to be polite and to keep calm but it was very difficult under the circumstances he then informs me that if i wish to cancel i would incur a charge for remaining services in the contract when i have not had the services i have ordered because of their incompetence and surely the period should apply from point of service activation as how will you know if its suitable unless you use the service surely i maintained i was cancelling without charge to which phil attempted to contact to track down my package i was put on hold for around minutes and left waiting for phil to come back and confirm what had already told me nice one i did call back again on saturday th june to once again speak to the cancellations team and immediately requested escalation to a manager the original advisor did of course get about this but what else can you expect tbh at which point i spoke to kevin he did repeatedly try and give me the spiel about staying and that if i go elsewhere they probably wont be able to install for at least two weeks wasnt aware that bt are experts and have all the installation schedules of all the other telecoms providers now they must be psychic i did eventually get phil to agree to cancel my contract without charge after him repeatedly asking me are you sure are you sure obviously im sure or i wouldnt be saying that now would i anyway ive gone with virgin now and there were absolutely no problems whatsoever from point of order to installation they brought the router with them and put it in for me no questions asked and no charges happy customer bt however are dreadful,Bad,2.0
4334,i hold numbers on the same business account on premises i needed to move the office number to the business site and turn off the business number as it is rarely used the communication was poor the first contact was to say an engineer would have to come out in weeks to run a talktalk line to the business site that site already has a talktalk line in our name on the same account when questioning this they kept blaming open reach for making the call eventually i said the magic sentence but the talktalk line that already exists is right there on our business account i dont understand why there is a question about whether a line is running to that site or not they then were able to confirm that the renumbering could be done in the coming days and no engineer was needed i dont really know what was different about that sentence than all the other times i had said but theres already a talktalk line there but somehow i got the magic combination of words that time and it worked until this point i was treated like a really difficult person and argued with and was repeatedly told to wait weeks and speak directly to the engineer even though that would have been a waste of everyones time but i was correct all along if my initial line of questioning had not been treated dismissively and if i hadnt been spoken to in this borderline condescending way we wouldnt have had such a difficult time of it my case was then marked as closed i waited the rest of the day for visibly happened and i didnt receive any further calls or dashboard updates the following morning i contacted the chat line and asked for a status update i was told the case was marked as closed and handed to the provisioning team the notes there should show updates the notes said closed and handed to provisioning team i explained that this isnt a reflection of the current status and was then told well no the provisioning team dont use that system and dont write notes there eh why imply the customer was somehow at fault for not reading notes you know cant possibly be there the bad service is one thing but the whole experience of being treated like a difficult person when the real issue that made it difficult was poor communication and inclination to blame the customer first rather than listen was pretty lame not sure well be renewing our contract when its up i left a star up because the phones and internet work so star seems unnecessarily harsh if you want phones that work and you can tolerate less than competent and slightly customer service then talktalk is probably fine for you,Bad,2.0
4335,increased my bill when i added to my package kept the increased price when i removed it and have not given me the monthly credit which they agreed to do so im paying extra every single month,Bad,2.0
4336,without warning virgin did a hard credit search on me as you actually rent the router from them they dont give it you like other companies this knocked down my credit score quite a bit they then didnt take my payment at the end of the contract and it got recorded as a missed knocking my credit score down during the time i was shopping for a mortgage i had to write a letter of complaint for them to apologise and remove the missed payment it took separate occasions for them to install the broadband as the technicians kept coming out with the wrong bits and now a few years down the line we pay over a month just for broadband which doesnt work meaning i have to use my phone data we couldnt move providers due to something to do with providers in the area cant wait for the contact to be up so i can try another and if you have a contract with them but want to move and they cant go with you as they dont provide the service in the area you have to pay a ridiculous amount to come out of your contract id say avoid,Bad,2.0
4337,internet speed is good but expensive so should be,Bad,2.0
4338,i had been a loyal virgin media customer for years even though i wasnt happy with the price increase of their mb package to me to i was willing to stay if i could have gb for that price best offer for broadband only i kid you not needless to say im waiting to them to contact me regards collecting old router now incredibly happy with,Bad,2.0
4339,hi i purchased mini discs and got to connect but one keeps showing an fault and will not connect,Bad,2.0
4340,the service from virgin media has been a mixed bag front the start the overall package promises to be very good but has repeatedly failed to meet expectation frequent internet outages and unstable fibre broadband connection as well as probably the worst wifi range i have ever experienced with any provider has left me underwhelmed with virgin inability to get any sort of resolution to issues without being put on hold for an eternity or off with a less than helpful response from customer services or the online advisor have driven me to the point of giving to say i am merely waiting for the end of my contract so i can move to another provider that might actually give a damn about their customers,Bad,2.0
4341,our internet is very unpredictable and we are constantly having to reset box not been happy with virgin for quite some time and when contacting virgin we always get dave who is obviously from india whom i cant understand and feel awful when i cant understand him,Bad,2.0

4343,i had been with talktalk for many years and they were ok however trying to cancel my account was a nightmare i didnt have access to my online account so tried calling them after trying more than number i finally appeared to have the right one but had to wait for minutes to actually speak to someone then i was passed from person to person for another minutes eventually someone to help me all seemed well until they continued to charge me for a service even after i had cancelled the direct to the phone finally got a reply and promise of a refund via their text servicei wouldnt recommend talktalk to anyone unless you want to stay with them until you die,Bad,2.0
4344,recently got virgins m broadband package upgrading from a bt basic broadband package expected a significant improvement in performance but havent really seen it coverage through the house is also much reduced since switching there are now noticeable black ok but not really worth the money,Bad,2.0

4347,like many year customers i am self isolating my broadband is miles away in a holiday home as the government lockdown does not allow me to travel the broadband will lie totally unused for at least the next three months my request for to consider a three month suspension of service met with a refusal in these unique times the companies inflexibility to be helpful will colour my judgement at contract renewal time in september,Bad,2.0
4348,hi thanks for taking the time to leave a review im disappointed to hear about your experience with us this is not the level of service we aim to provide and we apologise for any inconvenience caused the speeds you get at home will of course depend on a variety of factors it depends on your package what and how many devices you have how they are connected amongst other do have a download speed guarantee though this will show the minimum speed we would expect for all our packages you can take a look at that here after having a look youre getting lower than the minimum over a direct wired connection then please do chat with our tech support on who will be more than happy to help you,Bad,2.0
4349,the internet speeds are good when its running but the service often drops in and out my main gripe with virgin is the helpline the only time i can speak to somebody living in mainland uk is if i am going to leave i am then put through to the retention team based in scotland however if you are having any technical issues the only people available to help are based in some call centre in india or pakistan who read everything from a script and although they may speak english they have absolutely no comprehension of the language its very frustrating trying to speak to somebody miles away who i have the greatest difficulty in trying make them understand its about time branson stopped exploring outer space and concentrated more with the inner space we all inhabit the only reason he can do what he does is because of the exorbitant amount he charges for internet only access currently i pay per month for the pleasure of having absolutely no technical help whatsoever from somebody based in the uk like i said internet good service terrible,Bad,2.0
4350,i initially purchased m and was thrilled with finally having fast speeds after spending too long from a mobile phone only to then upgrade to m for faster upload speeds at a competitive price this is where the positive experience ended however as i was overcharged by pounds for the first two months with an average overpayment of pounds a month reflected on my month bill and its still showing as incorrect when i check the amendments made to top this all off im getting fluctuations in speed at times as low as mbs or of maximum speed limit upload speeds seem mostly unaffected throughout which is a positive,Bad,2.0
4351,my services were to commence i think september i am not so sure now but it didnt till after or months later because you promised sending in an engineer but failed to do so while my had started at the required time call and promises went on for fairly a long long time when it finally started i was told it was the beginning of a new contract thereby extending my period since i had already missed much of the football i had no time for a prolonged argument and i accepted and moved on i laid many complaints about the performance of the broadband it was one promise after the other without satisfactory service in the end i had to leave for a higher fee paying for the same service but i am getting value for money,Bad,2.0
4352,just slow slow and slow even compared to asda mobile which uses a vodafone network rather than ee even when im well within a g range in city center for example it gives me lte i regret purchasing this month data even tho it was affordable im sorry but im returning to my previous provider,Bad,2.0
4353,talktalk offered me a new contract last year at but within months upped the cost having accepted the cost and contract ive a year of broadband that cuts out randomly is slower than agreed and prevents me streaming tv at busier times of the week i was given a months notice with an actual set date for automatic renewal of the contract to decide what i wanted to do next and options supplied i have decided to change to a different broadband provider within two days of the limit but on doing so discovered tt had already updated to the more expensive option a week earlier than the agreed date and attempted to charge me contract breakage fees of nearly a phone call to their service department resulted in them waving the contract fees but they informed me i would still need to pay my bill until the connection date to my new provider i then discovered they have terminated my broadband with immediate affect from the date i cancelled and i am now left with no broadband whatsoever while i wait the obligatory days connection with all this i am still receiving emails and text alerts asking me to reconsider and to fill out customer service feedback have decided to ignore them,Bad,2.0
4354,slow and poor network coverage th is terrible,Bad,2.0
4355,when i originally ordered virgin media having been with sky for a number of years i was told by the sales rep that virgin was faster and will reach all of my back wifes business is ran from a log cabin in back garden which it doesnt i have tried calling customer services and online to no reply or answer to our problem very badly run service will be returning to sky or another provider when contract is up,Bad,2.0
4356,customer service is very poor tried online chat but got ai responses endlessly on facebook there is no facility to message virgin or comment when you ring up theres a long wait and then with respect to the employees i cant understand what theyre saying wish i was with another provider once out of contract i will be,Bad,2.0
4357,as a new virgin media customer having switched from sky to date i have been disappointed with losing sky f hd which with virgin requires you to purchase the whole sky sports package free with sky entertainment hd broadband speed hit and miss really slows during long downloads menu system on tivo box not as clear as sky but virgin is not affected by weather as a motorsport fan losing f hd to me is a pain and i will leave as soon as i can also keep getting calls from virgin media on home phone and mobile which i have now blocked this was a pain sky more helpful towards me and since i left they still are happy to reconnect my box so i can receive channel i am missing shame virgin cannot do the same,Bad,2.0
4358,customer service advisor rude internet awful and management dont call back,Bad,2.0
4359,when you take virgin media connection please be aware if you move into new area not connected by virgin media you will be still charged early disconnection charge even though its their deficiency i feel its unethical for a company to have such practice and shows how oblivious they are for customer welfare and are only money minded you can not hackle out of this charge because you are in contract and they have this clause in the contract where they will make you pay out a big amount statistically virgin media only covers and with expansion plan they are still gonna cover of uk so you can easily get into their money making net even if you are not moving into a very remote area,Bad,2.0
4360,when the broadband works its great however there are periods more than with other providers when it just doesnt work or goes really slow previously were with sky whos service was rock solid albeit a little slower if you dont rely on broadband ie dont work from home etc for critical things then go for it if reliability is important to you you might want to look elsewhere,Bad,2.0

4364,visited the reading store shocking service received today by the the concierge at the door was excellent however the salesman i was handed dan the concierge said his name was he was not very interested about my issue i had on my phone and my billing issue instead kept asking me who my broadband was even though i said i was not interested that as came into store to have my issues sorted out finally got the issue fix as it was something to do with setting on my phone after visiting another provide store who i will be switching to as more helpful once my contract with ends clearly the guy needs more training however the first interaction with the concierge was friendly and welcoming so was shocked with the service i later received,Bad,2.0
4365,the wifi service is very poor not great customer service,Bad,2.0
4366,very poor information and instructions included with the ring door bell and did not identify that an additional door chime may need to be purchased and no on the set up which resulted in me a charge of pounds to set up the the bell happy,Bad,2.0
4367,bad customer service treat old customer not serious offers are always twice like was give new customer better ofer then old one its very good speed,Bad,2.0
4368,ill start with a positive and say that the package i have is good but expensive i have tried on quite a few occasions to contact by phone and its almost impossible to get through i did once get through after minutes and was passed to another department after answering a load of questions although i asked them not to transfer me as i would end up hanging on the phone again sure enough minutes i get through and was asked the same questions so a long conversation about me wanting to change my package by reducing the content nearly there and the phone goes dead very annoying and frustrating and still not july thank you megan for your response unfortunately you have advised the same methods of contact that i have an issue with the phone number option takes forever and the text service is a talk bot which then refers you to the website which then advises you to ring until you resolve the problem of slow response and then cutting customers off who wish to reduce their service it will not improve,Bad,2.0
4369,impossible to speak to anyone i was charged set up costs when i shouldnt have been my first bill was times what it should have been by the time i noticed it was apparently to late to remove them leaving me short of money this month instead theyve credited my account this problem took hours to sort out because you could only converse via live chat they eventually transferred me to the department that deals with this only to be left waiting for hours i gave up and tried again the next day so frustrating,Bad,2.0
4370,i ordered a new remote on august quoted delivery was days allowing for my having placed the order on a sunday i expected to take delivery by the following thursday at the latest it arrived on box note which accompanied the package came from an address in bolton about an hours drive from my home so i thought it extremely odd that the tracker information i received on the wednesday said it was en route via northern ireland and would be delivered the following day the footnote said that this was not a guarantee just as well i asked the tracking assistant for a more realistic forecast but got no response,Bad,2.0
4371,so disappointed ive been with virgin for years when you come off a contract they automatically triple the price for no extra service so they just want you locked in so if you move house or are in an unstable living situation they profit from vulnerable people for no reason charge me the same and roll my renewing my contract im being bombarded with useless spam email i did not give permission to contact me,Bad,2.0

4375,internet very slow most of the time the free tv programs are very limited unlike sky,Bad,2.0
4376,agents on the live chat are polite and try to be helpful but ask a lot of completely unnecessary and meandering questions and more importantly dont do what has been agreed in the chat the system also relies on the customer constantly chasing for updates rather than being kept informed of progress this was with ref to a faulty line when they knew that the person using the line had a medical condition requiring a home phone line not good enough,Bad,2.0
4377,my password for my mail box account does not work so i sought your help your assistant was as helpful as she was able to be but the problem lay with the security questions being requested i am being asked for information i do not immediately have ie the last four digits of the account where i set up the direct debit a month ago as the email activity is both business and pleasure so i do not know which of three of my accounts i used and this sort of information is not something one commits to memory or expect to remember as i have not made a payment yet i cannot look up a statement i gave the last three digits of each of the three accounts i would have used at the same time but that was unacceptable even though the chances of anyone else getting any the sequences correct is infinitesimal i now have no email service simply because i was asked to set up a password for my account having received the first bill this is not acceptable,Bad,2.0
4378,unless you have a degree in this is a very difficult device to not find anywhere in the instructions how to answer a the main base unit is too light needs blu tak to hold it down as the whole device is unstable it is top for his the delivery was excellent,Bad,2.0

4382,throughout the lockdown when the family had to work at home it was a struggle to maintain connectivity even though we have mbs package the connections kept dropping and we kept resetting per your online help but it would have been more helpful your systems were more proactive self diagnosing and self connections and where problems were persistent or chronic alerting your engineers to come out and help rather than have us call issues although it was never clear how i should do that if i really wanted i really am left questioning if its worth the money may look to change supplier shortly again why can you not offer a better rate until someone looks to leave what about rewarding loyalty with better rates instead of increasing rates,Bad,2.0
4383,nearly every month the internet does not work reported this a few times speed of internet no where near what we were told we would be getting totally fed up with getting automated service when phoning im not a robot and dont want to speak to a robot definitely would not recommend virgin media to anyone on a whole the service we are getting for the price we are paying is absolutely pathetic,Bad,2.0

4394,youd think that every company would have customer satisfaction at heart wouldnt you not this one perhaps theyre too large to cope or to care have email problems wont go into the details what i will say is that the cust serv teams read from scripts only noone reads the records of the previous if they were recorded at all repeatedly sent back and forth from dept to dept all saying of course sir we will help but nothing is ever they want to do all the way along is get you off their books to satisfy their you sure we cant close this we well cant,Bad,2.0

4403,i was very excited by the reviews of zen and would have loved to of been a customer because of there static ip uk support and it is a british company but sadly this had come to an end when they said it would take weeks and wanted to charge me on top of the to connect me saying it is bts connection charge due to no active we in the s this is where you can transfer a gb is less than a second and if bt has a monopoly on the lines then do something about it rather then trying to charge your customers although the good points for zen is the customer service and the wait on the phone was not long though i can not comment on the connection speeds or reliability,Bad,2.0

4419,the internet is awful we have tried on many occasions to sort this with virgin but the signal never improves,Bad,2.0
4420,why didnt i read these reviews before using them for installation was relatively fast and the installer was very polite the internet just does not even stretch to the next room or the room one floor above the need to contact virgin about this but that is literally impossible probably intentionally ive called and nothing to complain and i cant even do that for unclear reasons dont need this stress advise users to go elsewhere,Bad,2.0
4421,packages are okay but the talktalk router is just not up to the job making internet connection unreliable also when things go wrong they fight tooth and nail not to send out an engineer and rely on you taking your equipment apart to sort problems okay till something goes wrong then the fun begins,Bad,2.0
4422,really fed up with constantly having to call about poor broadband service i am paying for the highest speed and have never received anywhere close i upgraded late last year and due to upgrading to even higher speeds was told that there could be issues for a few weeks first date for completion was feb still was only getting at the top end usually low s and you could get on a sunday night complained and got a credit feb came and went and when there was no improvement called again another credit come april no change and i was told may for completion of the works still no better and when i called next in may i was told august as you can probably guess aug has come and gone and when i called yesterday was told th sept speed currently a pathetic i have been promised a substantial credit this time value unknown but not holding my breath meantime i have had notice my package is going up in price twice during this virgin this is just not good enough,Bad,2.0
4423,non stop issues from day constant connection issues and not getting the speeds i was paying cancelling i was told i cant hear you so im basically shouting down the phone but its mainly due to the amount of background noise on talk talks end,Bad,2.0
4424,loss of service out of the blue very unhelpful web page took mins of website searching and dead ends on the site to find help details,Bad,2.0
4425,the main downside of talk talk for broadband is the relentless stream of scam callers claiming to be from talk talk to be fair to talk talk they did change my number but even then the scam calls continued but at a reduced rate,Bad,2.0

4431,the receiver of my problem was hampered by the inefficiency of talk talk systems consequently nothing was done he couldnt even tell me if snail mail was received prior to being dealt with how difficult can it be to change a name on an account with talk talk he did all he was allowed to do which was no help at all,Bad,2.0
4432,really struggling to defend vodafone at the moment havent had too many issues while my contract was with them but since cancelling my contract at the end of the months i was told by the person on the phone that i would have no more payments taken as ive paid for the full months already the following month another bill came out putting me overdrawn i messaged the team and was told thats just how the billing system works and that on a certain date in the future i would get a partial refund back ive in the mean time spoken to multiple agents on the web chat and have been told different stuff each time such as when the refund will come back how the payments work what date my final bill is and now im still waiting for my refund the agents have all been friendly but seemed to all be telling me different stuff which is quite confusing unfortunately from this experience i wont be likely to use vodafone again,Bad,2.0
4433,i had been a loyal virgin media customer for years even though i wasnt happy with the price increase of their mb package to me to i was willing to stay if i could have gb for that price best offer for broadband only i kid you not needless to say im waiting to them to contact me regards collecting old router now incredibly happy with,Bad,2.0
4434,two star rather than one because as it happens the actual service i receive is very service however which was never brilliant has plummeted boys bots and more bots and just at the moment when i think im going to get a real human being im told that there will be a two hour wait but thats ok because i can simply get on with my day until they get round to they do get round to me im out and by the time i respond ive been referred back to the bots who want my name account number and inside leg measurement all over for the upcoming and future price rises rpi plus i can see no justification for company the only problem being that i suspect that the competition are probably no better which is why they get away with itthe day that we get another company delivering a similar service with customer service on the same level as a company like first direct all of these gangsters will crumble,Bad,2.0
4435,our broadband fails frequently so much so our elder sons just use data when they are here,Bad,2.0
4436,its like we speak the same language but dont understand each other,Bad,2.0
4437,all my previous contacts turned into numbers when my family phoned i could not tell who it was and too many nuisance calls i would not answer told virgin tried but failed to fix it,Bad,2.0
4438,i find their prices reasonable but i went through a third party broker i already had a sim only contract with them which i wanted to cancel as i had a new contract with them they refused and said id have to buy it out even though id taken a new one they still have my business i am in full agreement with the other reviews the customer service is terrible id like to work for them though seems like you can say just about anything to customers,Bad,2.0
4439,very difficult to contact by phone and speak to someone i agreed a monthly price to extend my contract which was confirmed via e mail i was then charged more and they wouldnt acknowledge their own e mail had a response to my review asking me to refer to my new contract i e mailed it to them with my query when i spoke to their customer services they just make themselves look worse,Bad,2.0
4440,i am very disappointed with the service the broadband is no where near as fast as it should be and is constantly dropping out wish i had stayed with sky the television isnt great either very slow,Bad,2.0
4441,the product is generally good disappointed that occasionally things are removed in the guise of progress eg radio stations accessed now via an app rather than a channel number meaning we cant pause or service is terrible unless you speak to someone in the cancellations department based in the wanted to upgrade our hub checked online we were entitled to a free upgrade but when ringing the normal call centre they tried to charge a lot of money nearly from what i can remember didnt make sense and felt as though someone was trying to rip us off eventually spoke to uk team and agreed free upgrade without argument or doubt which was a shambles when the equipment came they said we could take a month to finish watching recorded stuff on existing boxes and then install new equipment but a few days after new stuff arrived old equipment including internet stopped working took days of many phone calls and stress to get our tv services back as the boxes wouldnt activate properly scripted answers from call centre teams got us nowhere eventually the uk cancellations team were able to press a button and it worked how on earth do they think they can merge with o when they cant run the existing company,Bad,2.0
4442,absolutely ridiculous customer care chances that you can get support by a human operator are extremely low if you file a complain the process to get a response is even worse shameful at best it will take days and nothing gets solved even in terms of automation they are stuck at ten years ago if you ever interface with their whatsapp youll understand what i mean all this and they are not cheap at all,Bad,2.0
4443,second poor review ive had to write on trustpilot this week and probably ever just awful service to a loyal customer that has remained with them for years i signed up to upgrade our internet and was promised vouchers as part of the upgrade offer i had this in writing in my order confirmation email still havent received the online vouchers and customer service are blocking me constantly stating im not entitled to the vouchers i have no idea why i wouldnt be entitled but thats irrelevant as they were what i was promised when i upgraded ive paid my bills reliably for years so fulfil your end talktalk stars as one of the agents i chatted with online wad very helpful,Bad,2.0
4444,i have extreme trouble trying to get through to virgin to report faults and problems for instance with one problem i made nine phone calls spoke to about different people who all told me they couldnt help and they would put me through to somebody who could i was then put on hold countless times for hours in total and often they would cut me off and the line would just go dead after listening to piped music for hours whenever i did get through to someone i would have to go through the whole process of identifying myself once more which took ages and wasnt reliable in the end i gave up and left only coming back a bit later because they treated new customers better than existing customers,Bad,2.0
4445,its really annoying and difficult to register or just to top up a sim card online thats just ridiculous why should be so complicate to top up online,Bad,2.0
4446,coverage is fine but their billing system is archaic you really need to keep tabs on what theyre charging you each month especially with one off add ons that have a habit of rolling over despite being biggest disappointment with the network is the call centre wait times minutes wait consistently throughout the two years ive been with them the operatives are usually friendly and cooperative recently switched to same network a quarter of the price for the same data package no billing issues and they answer the phone immediately and are super accommodating when doing so,Bad,2.0
4447,i had been with talktalk for many years and they were ok however trying to cancel my account was a nightmare i didnt have access to my online account so tried calling them after trying more than number i finally appeared to have the right one but had to wait for minutes to actually speak to someone then i was passed from person to person for another minutes eventually someone to help me all seemed well until they continued to charge me for a service even after i had cancelled the direct to the phone finally got a reply and promise of a refund via their text servicei wouldnt recommend talktalk to anyone unless you want to stay with them until you die,Bad,2.0
4448,so my orange contract ran out but as the signal where i live has been getting worse over the last years or so i gave them a ring they were eager to upgrade me in spite of the poor signal but i decided to keep the existing handset on a sim only contract while i researched my best option months later i called them for a pac code to switch to o it turned out that i had signed up to a bridging contract which cost more than to get out of and ended up costing more monthly than a new contract with a new handset and poor signal would may or may not have sent piles of paperwork pointing out the folly that i had signed up to but who reads that i wish i been a customer for years i feel well and truly moral of this story is do not glaze over when a telesales person from orange is waffling on or you will get tucked up like a kipper,Bad,2.0
4449,although the actual physical broadband connection has been without problems trying to get anything sorted using their abysmal customer services is virtually a waste of time instructions re mobile phone account given to them in july had to be repeated in october because it had not been followed are an annoying company should you ever need help from them,Bad,2.0
4450,not happy i am now paying nearly double to o instead of the same and i have lost my historic emails that are very important to meso not happy at all im seriously thinking of moving everything to sky,Bad,2.0
4451,the overall service from was unremarkable reception was fair to good and reliable in most areas the calls soliciting new offers got irritating fast and their pricing plans are not the best but so far so they really fell down was their service after i changed carriers the process of leaving was straightforward but vodafone insisted on my paying a full months bill the unused portion of which they would refund after three months and multiple attempts at resolution i am still waiting for this refund i have on four seperate occasions been promised a refund within days and on two occasions card details have been given at no time has vodafone initiated contact with me to resolve the issue or to inform me of problems their customer service staff are polite enough but the structure of their complaints system is evasive and provides no email contact whatsoever the whole system seems heavily rigged towards making it as inconvenient as possible to get sensible resolution and next to impossible to have a meaningful dialogue that might result in changes being made,Bad,2.0
4452,really frustrating the wifi at home is appalling constantly dropping out in every room and trying to get through to virgin media to sort this is a painful experience i had an email the other day saying i could ask them anything on the community forums i visited said forums but it was a minefield of confusing advice downloading tools to check router performance etc etc why does the customer have to jump through hoops to diagnose an issue that should not be other option is via a webchat all well and good but the wifi cuts out during these calls which are therefore useless the advice i have received is to reset the router etc etc etc which i have done multiple times it does not fix the how easy it is to get through to someone during the initial set up but trying to fix a problem that affects the whole family i work from home for example is frustrating that we are not receiving the service we pay a lot of money for i will not be renewing when im sure virgin media will miraculously start to finally contact me sadly i have a long long wait until my contract is up and will no doubt have to put up with this dreadful service its really not on virgin any chance of being contacted directly with a helpful solution,Bad,2.0

4498,i am a new vodafone customer transferring across to vodafone from tesco mobile for a sim only set up process was reasonably smooth and quick however i am not happy that as part of the process of setting up that there was no prompting from vodafone to set up a direct debit for my monthly bill days into my contract i received a text message out of the blue telling me that i have not paid my bill that they are going to charge me a late fee on my next bill and they proceeded to swiftly cut me off from all services this has left a bad taste in my mouth and to be honest if this had occurred within the day cooling off period i would have asked to have left the contract and would have gone elsewhere not a nice welcome as a new customer as an honest paying customer with tesco mobile for years to then be issued with a penalty by vodafone within days of my new contract is not a good first impression and i think vodafone should set up direct debits with customers during the setup of the contract or at least prompt customers to do so at some point is this just a way to charge honest paying customers extra at the beginning of contracts,Bad,2.0

4509,response to vicky re my earlier review hi vicky i wont contact talktalk twitter or chat i am not on twitter despite not having reached middle age yet my issue seems to have been resolved purely because i have spent over hours or more over a series of phone calls to straighten it out while on the last call i overheard your agent say something that sounded like this is a sure if she had accidentally her headset she had to read out terms and conditions to me but i had to keep interrupting her because of background noise where she was sitting and problems with her headset microphone when i asked her to repeat what she had said she kept letting out huge sighs and started to excessively enunciate as if i were the one with the problem she evidently did not want to be doing that despite it being part of her job not only that after years of worsening service of being treated badly as a customer i dont have any more desire to be told we are sorry and would like to help knowing talktalk doesnt care anyway and nothing would be done i hate to say this but i actually wonder if your response to this trustpilot complaint is genuine would my issues genuinely but genuinely be addressed or have you just been told to respond to each bad review in the same manner you have no idea how many times over the years ive been spoken to rudely andor aggressively by your staff or been treated with the highest degree of indifference talktalk needs to understand why consumers are so frustrated when things go wrong and not just treat us like an annoyance i like to think that your service will improve perhaps start by respecting and properly treating the people who pay for your services and keep you in your jobs i am too far gone but i really hope you treat your existing and new customers with the respect they deserve as they pay you on a monthly basis for a service they should be entitled to called talktalk several times about my mobile contract given that proper notes are never updated against my account what i am promised on one call seems to be forgotten or incorrect on another i force them to please listen to the recording from the previous conversation thank goodness that talktalk records all their calls to improve their service once they told me they do not have access to old recordings but that is a lie i have never written a review about talktalk but todays phone call lasted over an hour and my previous phone call the same and to add insult to injury the staff are openly frustrated and rude and openly vent their frustration down the line ive been a talktalk customer for well over years and have noticed a rapid decline in their service despite being reluctant to change i had to change my broadband contract to bt because the talktalk broadband service was not working and they never did anything about it now i just have a mobile phone contract clearly a liability for talktalk as they are trying to get rid of their mobile department so dealing with them is quite literally a mission and a disappointing experience once i give up my mobile phone contract in a year i can safely say i will never ever deal with talktalk again go to bt for broadband sure theyre also not perfect but at least they seem to be a bit more courteous to their customers oh and my bt broadband doesnt keep dropping like talktalk broadband used to,Bad,2.0

4561,broadband is decent in my area however virgin will constantly take advantage of its customers by constantly hiking the price like many of these companies they also force you to pay for on a home phone the tv package is about as good as freeview so that also is a point of contention because id rather not pay for that service either basically for a month i have fast broadband with a phone line and tv package i dont want,Bad,2.0

4630,i was a customer since before virgin media existed when it was called at two different addresses over a period of around years the product was reliable and installation went well both times initially they supplied tv landline and broadband but the price just went up and up with no real difference or improvement to tv channel choice in the end i paid more than for a landline that we never used loads of tv channels but too often nothing interesting on medium package but the broadband was good mb i cancelled tv and phone started watching freeview and paid for broadband only i needed that to be able to work from home when that went up to and they refused to give me a better deal i left my luck was that had laid their cables down our street by then and i was able to get mb broadband through vodafone for per month so far thats just as good as virgin when i cancelled virgin they suddenly changed their mind and offered to reduce my monthly fee to too late i suspect that virgin will be losing many customers in my area to vodafone and they deserve it further to the response from virgin it is not the case that virgin is not able to give existing customers better deals its a conscious decision that virgin makes by all means if they give you a good deal then go for it but be prepared to move once your deal ends,Bad,2.0
4631,issue trying to speak to a sales advisor to renew my contract unfortunately it appears that the ladies english was not what you would expect for a sales person i understand that you use indian call centres to save money but surely there is a the customer service for the last few years has been generally quite poor in broadband performance and issue resolution for the premium price i would expect a lot better what a shame,Bad,2.0
4632,got a good deal for sim contract however for the months ive been with them theyve been unable to setup my account so i cannot view bills or settings etc ive tried chatting them online tried calling them and tried visiting in store they all have different ideas of whats causing the problem but ultimately nobody is able to husband decided to sign up to their broadband also for a good deal weve had a lot of issues weve had over the last week with connecting and seems lots of other customers are having the same clearly an issue on side and yet they waste hours of time on the phone making out its our fault then its mysteriously fixed on their side until the next issue,Bad,2.0

4634,virgin media is good in terms of its availability in london with it being everywhere but really the upload speeds are pretty bad and it uses copper they do lie about their service being fibre optic people have complained to the advertising agency about this but they didnt find a verdict and let them off the hook as copper was the only cable that connected to the houses and the rest was fibre my friend yesterday was complaining about how trash his wifi was due to everyone downloading new console games in the area everything is shared bandwidth in virgin media which is just annoying so gaming on peak time is impossible,Bad,2.0
4635,i had no response from the talktalk after i was asked to explain why i was contacting had hopes that talktalk service has really improved but using the phrase were following government guidelines and we are working very hard to help you whilst closing down the call saying were closed get lost metaphorically during a time where ordinary people are being subjected to life threatening disease whilst being exposed to political management with the interests of a minority of billionaires landowners and multimillionaire industrialist leaders it is completely inappropriate to dismiss a call for help to restore the only service that an elderly couple in isolation can use for external communication,Bad,2.0

4684,i have been using virgin media for years now but for obvious reasons started to pay extra attention to the quality of service since march mandatory work from home began now i do understand that it may not be correct to use this period which was especially hard for network providers as a reference point so i will try to be fair in this start with good bits service engineers are super nice and friendly and there is virtually no queue to book a visit when you have an issue normally when you have a good signal and the cabinet youre connected to is not overloaded you get good speed normally within the promised band i like that you can view your bills through website which is nice and clear all the bits are easily available to manage and view when you need them the range of packages is pretty solid too although i am only a broadband user worth mentioning i was their mobile user too but it was long time ago and for a short period so i wont consider it substantial for a there is more on the bad side unfortunately the service is very unreliable and dont get me wrong thats not an exaggeration it drops times a day regularly it means you can almost expect to have short periods of no broadband at peak times there are especially bad days when you get nothing for minutes or when the number of drops exceeds a dozen obviously it is worse during lockdown on work days but this happened to me even before the lockdown too however i would not stick to regularity bit as i was not working from home some point it became almost impossible to book a service engineer you literally had to wait for the moment when broadband drops completely if wont work if your speed is just low and only then the website would open the booking form for you note that the service phone line numbers were also hard to find through the website i am almost sure they simply removed them there were couple of occasions when i used saved google copies to find the phone centre experience is subpar i had to call three times to arrange house move keeping the same monthly contract one time was especially annoying when they put me on a minimal term contract although i was clearly told by the agent it would be monthly rolling contract which was my key requirement too i am pretty sure i repeated it to them at least times on the call and it was still years ago i had issues with speed stability it would keep the speed but drop to mbs regularly it took me calls and a week to wait for an engineer to come and tune the signal ratios at the cabinet to fix this all my calls ended up with ah i see everything works for you now sir so i had to be super lucky with timing to actually convince them there was an year i was having issues because of the rotten cable that goes to my house and again it took three engineer visits to detect the issue they kept saying ti was something odd they could not triage while all the time i was having regular reboots times per day of the router that caused interruptions of minutes to every connection in the one last bit to make it fair in the light of lockdown and problems with capacity which i am fed every time i report a drop to them i know quite a few people in the neighbourhood who had to work from home using a competitor surprisingly they did not have similar issues with reliability they mentioned drops in speed but never complete loss of service when you have nothing considering that my day is video calls any drop for longer than seconds is critical for my job and i cant say that i am supported by them at overall my rating for just lockdown experience would be star and only because i cant put but considering my overall experience with virgin i think itd be fair to put,Bad,2.0

4866,first thing bt runs a hard credit search on potential customers before deciding to take them on but we pay in advance so really bt isnt lending us anything and they can easily terminate the service if customers dont pay so why the hard search just because some other broadband companies also do this doesnt make it on new builds none of the high street broadband providers can connect a new build property its all bt for the first few months currently bt is only offering year contracts so stuck for years there are other providers who can supply broadband to new builds on rolling month contracts though if i purchase another new build i will not be using bt service hit or miss some great some not if youre looking for a broadband that you can get and forget with no teething issues dont go with bt there will be admin involved eg they spelled my name wrong even though i spelled it out didnt deliver my phone package reordered but billed me for delivery these have all now been corrected but has caused i have fibre to the premises lucky you say nah not with bt i went for up to mbps which with means i dont share with neighbours and should get it all i dont the speed does not feel any faster than my previous standard fibre broadband with vodafone at up to mbps their slowest which was cheaper than current bt although one pro with bt is that this internet hardly ever cuts out and is fairly reliable,Bad,2.0

4869,the internet is good though cutting out randomly at points it does seem to be a fast connection everything else is trash the customer service is so bad they couldnt even help me set up a virgin mobile account since apparently you need two accounts the furthest i got was to setting up the email the girl on the other end used the wrong email and told me to just use it like hello i cant just use an email that isnt mine she then hung phone service is also terrible calling anyone sounds so bad and barely ever works my deal is coming to an end soon so im probably going to keep the internet but change phone deals,Bad,2.0

4927,the second box in our bedroom hasnt worked for a while and since i have just agreed a new contract and am paying for it i thought i may as well have it working the person i spoke to originally after holding on the telephone for about half an hour was actually very helpful and arranged to send an engineer to replace the box he didnt show up on the agreed day and a couple of weeks went by while i steeled myself for the thought of another half and hour of hanging on the phone being forced to listen to appalling music has anyone ever told you this is a cruel and unusual form of torture by the way i received one of your jolly how did we do emails so decided to respond thinking that the information could be passed on to the appropriate department thus saving me the need to endure the phone system again no such luck my comments elicited the most ridiculous response so bad it was actually funny in summary tough luck mate you have to telephone another couple of weeks went by again while i tried to get in the mood for the endless drivel and bad eventually spoke to someone again very helpful a date was arranged and an engineer actually arrived this time he was also very helpful supplied a new v box and got it conclude the service is actually good when you get to it the down side is the interminable hanging on the telephone and that dreadful music,Bad,2.0

4934,i am happy with the contract i have had over the last eighteen months with talktalk i find their prices on the package i have chosen are competitive however i would like to be on their my account to communicate with the company on the service they provide for me and for me to make some amendments online when i need to make changes to the service i receive this would be better for me as speaking on the phone with some of the talktalk staff is difficult because they speak so fast and their phone lines are not the clearest for sound surprising for a phone company also writing online to them by email is easier for me because some of their advisers are difficult to understand and rush what they want to tell me on the phone i have found phoning to their service advisers difficult i have a hearing deficit and wear hearing aids and have a special phone for a company which is in the communication industry i am finding for the second time phone calls have a poor reception some of their customer advisers rush to give you information and wish to be off as soon as they can probably to another customer this afternoon i had to phone through to scottish southern energy and being on the phone to this organisation was a good experience the phone lines are very clear and the customer advisers are friendly and helpful the staff are trained to be client friendly talktalk would be a comfortable experience if they trained their staff to be patient talk clearly and not too fast when giving information i do not like to be rushed when i am making a decision on the services offered because which ever contract i choose i have to stay with it for eighteen months today i have felt like tearing my hair out trying to get access to set up myaccount with talktalk i have been informed by a customer adviser that i need a second email address before i can get on to myaccount on line with talktalk mobile one of their other customer advisers trisha pleasant adviser gave me a step by step instruction on how to set up myaccount with talktalk in order to follow the instructions to get a new email account i have to have a my account all set up however when i attempt to set up a my account i cannot get my password accepted i requested a new password to go to my mobile but they did not send it so i returned to the site and requested they email my new password to me instead of using the mobile phone i am still waiting for the password it is so time consuming this site and when i web chat with the talktalk advisers most of them rushed me to print out return responses to them the customers should not be made to feel as some thinking time is required before actually typing the response to the customer adviser so when typing information to the customer adviser he or she needs to let the have sufficient time to think make a decision and then type the reply to the customer adviser so here i am tonight tired with trying and will try one more time tomorrow if i am not fixed up with my account then i will give up on it thank you reading about my frustrations with the staff at this company flora,Bad,2.0

4982,i cant fault support sales process i was a little choked off that they took the month for meg deal off the table the week it was announced they were installing in my install went smoothly with the exception of a network issue further down the line which meant the install engineer what here for hours not thing i am disappointed about and a reason why i considering cancelling less than a week into my contract is despite what their website says they dont allow you to port forward unless you pay a month extra for a static ip i known this before i would have stayed with bt who came in last minute with a very favourable offer and they allow port forwarding with dynamic external ip addresses so you dont have to pay for a static address at the time of writing the page says we use nat to efficiently assign our ipv address range to our residential customers due to the shortage of ipv addresses some applications may be affected by this eg online gaming pp applications and vpns so you may wish to set up port forwarding it then goes on to describe how to set up port forwarding on the eero devices at no point does it say by the way if you want to do this itll cost you another a month if you needed a static ip address surely it would be mentioned in the review would have been stars for but due to the issue of the on the port forwarding i have had to take stars away as if i do move back to bt there will have been a lot of hassle and wasted time for after one week of use have had major issues with the fibre box not the eero cutting out and getting stuck in a boot cycle every hours only way to fix is to power off and back on fibre box was replaced on thursday but the issue remained an update has been done on the fibre box so time will tell if its fixed again i cant fault support desk tyler i think im just the unlucky one,Bad,2.0

5004,i really like the ease and simplicity of they way everything was displayed it made choosing the new deal from a new provider that i had previously not considered well worth the trouble plus i got to spend on my new baby that arrives later this year so that cant be bad for wanting to pay the same price as my previous years contract,Good,4.0
5005,needed phone change urgently popped in tesco mobile whilst shopping friendly knowledgeable assistant i informed her of what i required she gave me the options re upgrades i was out of the store within mins nice easy process even for a year old like me,Good,4.0
5006,good service generally and like the way members are so in control of what we spend month to month even on the new contract its still only thing what stop me from giving stars is that smarty give a lot more data for what pay so feel like are at risk of not being as great value i will currently stay though as my kids are on which means they can always get in touch even if no credit,Good,4.0
5007,tried to obtain answers to queries by clicking on help and support but could not get anywhere i then tried the chat line which was much more positive and helpful what i required is now being sent to me by post and i now have the telephone number i required to enable me set up or remove services,Good,4.0
5008,i do love the channels the box we have two and a free sim card internet and landline full package but i do think it would be nice to reward loyalty with fixed price contracts as i do feel that the full price package is dear and having to ring up and say you will have to consider leaving to get it reduced back down defeats the object,Good,4.0
5009,had to battle with the offshore customer service department who seemed hell bent on selling me more bandwidth eventually managed to make an on shore customer service team that i was experiencing technical issues with my very old tivo boxes both old boxes were replaced and all my issues went away the flexibility from the two new boxes is excellent and the streaming service are now a joy to use now the sting in the tail i have been informed of a large price hike that i cant afford so my have to terminate my subscription,Good,4.0

5146,the service is very good with very few instances of downtime usually once a year or so which are usually fixed within an hour or two its the best broadband option fastest too if i had any complaints then it would that i wish it were easier to customise our virgin media package online so if we wanted to say drop to a lower tv pack drop the and increase the broadband service we could do that without having to phone up to do it you can upgrade online so why not the other way i also prefer to have the online helpline chat restored as im hard of hearing and not keen on the workaround they currently have in place apart from that the people i have been in contact with have been very helpful and friendly our tv box is a bit dated now and the interface is clunky no idea whether thats improved in the newer boxes but i would hope so its part of the reason why i just watch netflix prime disney plus,Good,4.0

5157,this would have been stars great service from the bt shop but unfortunately your bt overseas customer service let you down badly i got an email telling me that i was due to be upgraded to digital voice and an option to order free online either a new phone or an adaptor i tried to the bt shop to order the adaptor but it wouldnt recognise my bt username or password eventually i had to open a new account with the bt shop to complete the order then i had my doubts whether the offer was genuine and got onto live chat with bt only to be told it was definitely a scam and to disregard it and there was no record of an order from me i was still unsure and asked again how the original email could look so genuine no explanation and eventually i was cut off from the chat none the wiser luckily the adaptor did arrive and a few days later i got a letter from bt telling me that i was being upgraded to digital voice so the original email was real bt customer service you definitely need to get your act together,Good,4.0

5444,very good service from zen so from bt on th sept and no issues with the internet so far a little more expensive than other providers and no calls package but am getting better speeds with zen up from mbps to mbps additions of a static ipv and ipv is a bonus for myself as i minor web applications so static addresses make everything much simpler for the customer service i have experienced is from before my switch to zen and the customer service was very good i actually got in contact about months before i was due to switch to ask about prices and the possibility of waiving the fibre connection fee kelly was very helpful and was able to provide the same offer to me when i went to organise the broadband setup about weeks before the end of my bt original order switch date was going to be the th september but when bt said they were going to charge me for equipment and for ending the contract days early i asked zen to switch the date this was a simple process less than minutes on the phone and that included a transfer from one department to the direct debit before my service was activated was a little bit of a faff as the service hadnt been added to their online system yet but this was sorted pretty quickly via that if you have a problem you can easily get in contact with someone who knows what they are doing and you can have a discussion at the same level without attempts to pull the wool over your eyes like other providers tend to up the good work,Good,4.0

5489,ive been with zen for more than two years and have had no problem with the service however they have not been proactive with offers of upgrading my service even though the network locally had been upgraded i also remember when i signed up with them originally there was no need to sign up for more than a month during the proposed recent renewal they wanted at least a year why given my track record with them i was annoyed that they felt the need to tie me into a contract i started to look at options and am now tied into a contract with x higher speeds and lower monthly rates,Good,4.0

5522,i used the shop to discuss my options at the end of my current contract the shop was well organised with shoppers encouraged to book an appointment time this avoided overcrowding the sales person was welcoming knowledgeable and informative about my options the agreed new internet phones were delivered as promised informed me as to when the system would be available to use the phones were easy to set up but the signal from the extra ee backup router will only show one bar out of the three available i ordered a third phone using the online system and it too arrived as fine,Good,4.0
5523,good service generally and like the way members are so in control of what we spend month to month even on the new contract its still only thing what stop me from giving stars is that smarty give a lot more data for what pay so feel like are at risk of not being as great value i will currently stay though as my kids are on which means they can always get in touch even if no credit,Good,4.0

5562,chose virgin because of an introductory deal was pleased with the service but not sure if i will continue after deal period ends there are many good features such as the recording of multiple channels at the same time but there are also annoying things like the suggested recordings this is frustrating because it repeatedly records shows that i deleted the first which demonstrates that it does not learn from my preferences another poor feature is the access to free to view iplayer channels the bbc version is the same as going through the red button or online but channel and itv are totally different and are missing loads of the programmes that you can get on their red button options,Good,4.0
5563,are on the whole good and i love the fact you get money back for taking part in their online community plus the goody bag system is fabulous they even let you know if youre spending too much which is amazing and suggest a cheaper recently it has annoyed me that i have to keep logging in to the website via a text message number so i have to keep looking for my phone in order to access the site as i use a desktop the field marked keep me logged in doesnt work which is and i cant get a response from them about this no matter what i do so i lopped off one star for that annoyance,Good,4.0

5657,its nice to be offered a reduction in monthly broadband cost without actually having to ask for it however the headline pm fixed charge is slightly misleading as to keep the same benefits as i have now i still need to pay an extra for unlimited uk calls the process was thorough and efficient using the chat option the only fault i would raise is that the chat box is far too small on my pc so you have to lean forward to read it and scroll through the legalese as it doesnt all fit within the chat box,Good,4.0

5707,i doubt theres many good reviews for mobile phone companies but i thought id just add my thoughts since switching to ee from o in ive never had an issue with anything that wasnt resolved quickly the customer services are fairly swift to answer the phone and although mistakes are sometimes made i always got a positive result as well as professionalism and courtesy from ee staff o on the other hand were absolutely awful to deal with o has a better signal at my home than ee and there are far more black spots in the local area with ee than with o in case you were wondering my company issued phone is o but that is something i can cope with just to not have to suffer os incompetence so this review is more of a negative review of o rather than a positive one of ee but thats the cold hard truth of it ee arent perfect but are light years ahead of some of their competitors in their customer service standard,Good,4.0

5724,ive been with o for a long time now and have noticed that since the exclusive deal with the original iphone they had to significantly up their game in terms of network service and customer service im pleased to say that both have come on leaps and bounds my best experience was recently with their telephone help i had a query regarding voicemail and my online account the woman i spoke to had enough knowledge to instantly give me answers to my questions and had any relevant personal information available to her without delay one query i had about voicemail she was slightly unsure about she asked me to try something and after ending the call rang me back unexpectedly within minutes to say she had asked a colleague about my problem and had some better advice for me ive never really had any network issues with them and i believe their pricing is fair why not stars well because i think their shop staff could be more knowledgeable on the few occassions ive dealt with instore staff they have either needed to confirm with another member of staff or phone the telephone help line i understand they are essentially sales staff but support knowledge would help give customers a more personal help service,Good,4.0

5806,when eventually we received the product it is doing the job that we wanted it to do after putting the order through we realised that the expiry date shown for our credit card on the confirmation order was incorrect and out of date the date shown was not the date we had input when ordering the product we tried to contact bt to let them know but were unable to find a way to do this as a result i was informed by email from bt shop that the payment had been rejected i replied to this email saying i thought the problem was that the wrong expiry date had been used for some reason bt shop kindly sorted this out by resubmitting the correct expiry date and let us know the order had gone through we didnt find the ordering process very user friendly,Good,4.0

5811,ive been a virgin media customer for many years since talktalk were a bunch of incompetent who couldnt deliver a service virgin media arent the best price granted but what other provider delivers the speeds virgin does to your home we have times where the service becomes unstable but generally its a one off in a blue moon and doesnt last too long so what service guarantees uptime none so its to be couldnt be happier with virgin media as said above their delivering me internet couldnt ive got my cctv connected to the router and when on my mobile as vodafone gives me a good g connection when out from home the virgin and cctv box respond immediately to my view request so latency and pings are also the stars is because your virgin tv is something else its real poor to elaborate the amount of channels compared to sky and the box is real slow this is something thats always been an issue since ntl days and hasnt been fixed nearly years later however the picture quality delivered via your cable network is far more superior over sky any a busy household with the kids and their my work laptop mobiles tablets linux server the internet holds up real well i think if i sent this kind of traffic down an isp like sky they would have a fit and kick me off so thumbs up for a reliable internet with good speeds,Good,4.0

5817,honestly my wife and i have had a talktalk line for a few years as they have an excellent international calling addon weve never really had any problems with them but due to the way they market their packages when i called and asked them to remove the broadband and give us phone only i was told the two cant be separated because the adsl broadband is free and the line alone would therefore be more expensive than the phone and broadband plus when youre already on a tariff with them and the contract ends they should automatically change you to the cheaper price if the same service is now being offered at a cheaper price instead youd probably have to call them and sign up for a new contract at the new price,Good,4.0

5902,virgin media give an excellent service and i would have no hesitation in giving them stars if only at the end of your contract they send you a letter telling you that you special offer is coming to an end and they then quote you a ridiculously high renewal cost why does it take a telephone call threatening to move to a new company to get to a fair competitive price that both sides are happy with come on virgin media make it easy for clients to give you stars you have got everything else ok,Good,4.0
5903,ee have supplied me with broadband and mobile phone contracts for years good coverage and a good network ee recently contacted me proposing a rise in my mobile contract fee and i rang back to take issue with the proposal not only did the helpful employee stop the increase but he arranged for a new lower contract sent me a link to the new terms and conditions to read on my phone using a system by but their system blocked landscape view why so i had to scroll times to the right and then back again to read each line when i complained about this he helpfully emailed the link to my inch dell laptop this link was also to systemthe link opened showing a page that occupied of my available screen size and when i to zoom in i was blocked by their system so i was unable to read it without a magnifying wasnt the fault of the poor chap trying to help me but ee is using a system that breaches every principle of access for readability deliberately and get your act together this sort of behaviour is terms and conditions should be readable by your customers and you should not be taking steps to ensure that they are gentleman kindly played a recording of the ts and cs eventually but i would far rather have been presented with them in a readable format,Good,4.0

5911,ive been a long standing customer and i really relate to the ethos of ive converted many colleagues even for business use where they have saved hundreds of pounds per annum im very pleased just one gripe the failure to increase the data on the goody bag is a poorly veiled attempt to tempt you to pay just more to get quadruple data thats sharp practice and not with the traditional methodology hence the stars,Good,4.0

5918,many attempts of chatting with their cs and technical supports finally we came to a resolution of offering me discount due to no coverage in certain areas in central london where i work everyday that was a logical and proper response hence updating the rating from star to star and kudos to sean who were patient and competent in solving my problem updatethe fact that they replied and asking me again to file another complaints after my multiple repeated conversations not to mention the same qa with multiple people that they probably outsourced with their cs just proved that they have a poor structure and system why do i have to repeat myself again by filing another complaint to their complaint team why cant the cs people that ive spoken to relay the information and actually try to fix the problems that paying customers currently facing i will not change this review or update it until its been resolved original my oh my i should have read the reviews before signing on a contract with them absolutely useless service in all areas they dont have coverage in london and when ask to cs about it theyre all in denial and giving you basic tips for children like restart your phone and turn on g settings an absolute trash company that you should not trust im still battling with them to get off the contract early because im paying month for bar signal and no internet data in central london their cs team is really sneaky and malicious youll get passed to so many people and feel exhausted thats their strategy to con customers absolutely shameless company never again,Good,4.0

5949,great live chat with amanda very helpful thank you,Good,4.0
5950,good service generally and like the way members are so in control of what we spend month to month even on the new contract its still only thing what stop me from giving stars is that smarty give a lot more data for what pay so feel like are at risk of not being as great value i will currently stay though as my kids are on which means they can always get in touch even if no credit,Good,4.0

5963,why does vm ignore old do they increase the monthly fees when a cheaper offer is available for the exact same they trying to show the banks that they can beat them at their own game the cable service that vm provides is far better and more reliable that most of the alternatives they appear to be constantly moving forward with new services and improvements in general but that should not mean that they can ignore their old customers and concentrate on gaining new ones or do they expect us to be looking every week to see if they have provided a cheaper way of receiving what we get is that helping customers no and i expect that many customers are irritated when they discover that they have been overpaying that rankles and affects how customers view vm are perhaps even more importantly whether they will recommend vm,Good,4.0

5966,ive been with virgin now for years and have had no concerns i always find them pretty useful if i have a thing i would say is i hate that they try and charge their loyal customers more than their new customers surely staying with a company should earn you some benefits every time my service is due for renewal i have to call up and ask what they can do for me to prevent me leaving and im always put through to someone in another country who is far from helpful i always have to ask to be put through to cancellations and speak to someone in the uk before i can get a discount on my account this shouldnt be a continuous fight when ive been with them so long,Good,4.0

5975,broadband speed is brilliant i have the gig bundle with pretty much everything attached to it tv you get tivo boxes mobile with unlimited data and landline with anytime calls only moan so far is occasional nighttime outages are not helpful when i work nights and the upload speeds are needing some serous looking at i barely get mbps up but hopefully some line upgrades should unlock the full bandwidth soon otherwise a good broadband to go with even if only a lower speed gig is very helpful for my household and our gaming sessions,Good,4.0
5976,in feltham i feel their services and advance updates are very prompt and reliable i used had little issues with direct debit but now even that was sorted out in few calls,Good,4.0
5977,this review is a direct comparison with full fibre suppliers charging high than required broadband gives a very good packaged broadband service and although not advertising high speed om the package i have fibre not available in my area yet i am surprised at the amount equipment it can take with very good speed easy set up and clear instructions i will recommend to all the people have advised to go with vodafone,Good,4.0
5978,upgraded my phone found staff to be informative friendly polite and helpful didnt have full stock of phones on display but i was ok with this as i knew what i set up transferred my phone contents over but due to dreadful internet signal within the shop this process took a very long time,Good,4.0
5979,good experience and she is helpful,Good,4.0
5980,good service generally and like the way members are so in control of what we spend month to month even on the new contract its still only thing what stop me from giving stars is that smarty give a lot more data for what pay so feel like are at risk of not being as great value i will currently stay though as my kids are on which means they can always get in touch even if no credit,Good,4.0
5981,im really glad we switched to as the fibre broadband speed is so much better however the actual setting up switching over was less than straightforward the person who was trying to reel us in to switch was obviously so keen we switched probably a commission thing that he booked the date the engineer would come round without checking it out with us first we did manage to change it to a date that suited us but not without the hassle of trying to ensure our previous supplier wouldnt cut us off before the actual transfer went ahead the engineer who did the transfer was unsure about our telephone setup and was consulting his colleague throughout the work he seemed a bit put out by our asking questions over the phone issue and kept saying that we need to stop asking questions because he would not be able to finish the work on time or would have to come back on another also asked us to move the main phone so that he could connect it to the hub this all seemed at odds with the description of the service which stated we would not have to do anything the engineer would everything we also had to clean up the mess after his drilling etc as he had already handed us a brochure as he was walking out the door showing us his details asking us to give him a good review and saying the telephones should work normally in a couple of were left unsure about things not really understanding things on this new cable network and trying to speak with customer services who told us we could not consult them unless we gave them the security details as our telesales advisor hadnt given us this information we were clueless and couldnt resolve our issues directly with them plus it cost my daughter around in mobile costs for about minutes on the line to them in the end i had to muddle through finding things out through apple and virgin site as our apple devices were showing the was not secure being an year old isnt ideal when it comes to finding things out on the internet and i realise that i now have to jump through a number of hoops before i can speak to an actual person from customer services that being said when i have subsequently spoken with them they have been courteous and increase in internet speed though has made a big difference so i repeat i am glad i did switch,Good,4.0
5982,vodafone appts great for customer service particularly he was excellent in trying to help me and he did would recommend,Good,4.0

5988,recently moved from vodafone where i have had a nightmare months of horrendous customer service to a sim only from talk mobile who use the vodafone network but have excellent customer service skills from the few times i have called them ported my old number over with no issues and set up my on line account the only thing i would suggest is an app to keep up to date with all my usage info and i didnt realise that talk mobile only offer a g service and not g until i called through and was advised but so far i have had no issues with signal and the g seems to be doing the job for browsing,Good,4.0
5989,i have just bought an hp g with free delivery and it arrived on time with undamaged packaging the only issue was that the warranty start was dated months ago though there was no evidence that the system had been used previously i have resolved that through hp support but it was unexpected and should have been unnecessary it is obviously a superseded model but at the price i was expecting that,Good,4.0
5990,great communication skills and clear english,Good,4.0
5991,ive used bt shop in the past and found their prices to be competitive and delivery this occasion i was looking for was a ring doorbell wired and as luck would have it i was alerted that there was one available in the used stock section of which i was not previously aware it was offered at an attractive discount and arrived unit was indistinguishable from new except for one item a link which was not as per the picture of box contents turns out it was a fused link rather than a plain than that all was well and with a month warranty it was a worthwhile to be aware of in these days of upvc doors and glazing is that is advisable to temporarily wire it up in order to ensure the optimum view and plan the wire my case i was surprised when the day trial of ring protect commenced immediately the unit was powered without requiring my approval and then disconcerted that after three hours the trial was is something to be aware of i suppose when buying previously owned products which include a trial now have to wait a month for my to install the cables to avoid damage to my glazing units but at least i know the unit will show me the view i need and the wires will be with my purchase,Good,4.0

5993,bt shop offered a good choice of land line single unit at competitive prices i paid an extra for express delivery and the parcel arrived within hours from ordering packaging was poor with no polystyrene or bubble wrap additional protection to the basic thin cardboard box which was found to be deformed on arrival however the phone came with full instructions easy to follow and works well with good controls and large keys the cables provided were much shorter than those on our original unit but we managed to set it up with some furniture rearrangement we like the new phone,Good,4.0

6015,i am happy with the broadband and telly but very disappointed that i cannot get an upgrade to a better phone despite the new contract being ten pounds less than i normally pay this is because i took over a flat with someone elses debt in it i have a lot of money in the bank a good job several virgin accounts i pay for my sons mobile yet because of someone elses bad debt i cant get an upgrade when a teenager on minimum wage can this is very upsetting and when my phone out i will never ever use you as a phone provider i am very bitter as you can probably gather good broadband though,Good,4.0

6048,difficult to get anybody by phone to discuss problems etc and even then sometimes understanding them can be difficult and they expect you to be quite technically really annoying problem is that once a program has been selected to record if the bbc then decide to show it on another channel or later time you completely miss the program and record one you dont want ie recent bbc changing channels to show tennis on bbc and thereby recordings of east enders etc are media should automatically adjust to suit any changes even at short notice,Good,4.0

6055,purchased to replace an earlier version which was eating it works exactly as expected from the earlier version call blocking is are a couple of issues i have the base units are really light so on a shiny surface dont stay put the phones dont sit securely in the bases they work but dont feel secure the quality of the sound from the handset isnt great and poor compared to modern mobiles etc the buttons on the main base unit are tiny much smaller than the earlier version look great but not practical if its not located in well lit areas bluetooth to your mobile address book is great pity theres no way to transfer from previous versions of the same phones finally why do the base units have to have leds continually on in the bedroom this is especially inconvenient and silky having to stick tape over a brand new unit also these are on probably cost a fortune over the life of the conclusion its ok good value at half price in the sale but would have been returned at full price ok but disappointing,Good,4.0

6146,whenever my contract is due they do their level best to give me the best deal but i still think they could go further with packages for seniors and people who have been with them for over years,Good,4.0
6147,they have been a great service provider to me for years rarely ever lost signal as it seems to be very strong where i live in manchester only reason that i have given them stars overall is because their prices are rather high for what they offer would recommend though,Good,4.0

6149,very useful information given and very easy to use would definitely recommend people using this service rather than trying to read through everything,Good,4.0
6150,it was easy enough to find the phone i wanted on the tesco website i had already done my own research on iphone models specs and to look up different tariffs and prices for different contract lengths and data caps etc it was worth comparing all the different information especially since the prices shown defaulted to different contract lengths so eg an older phone might be month for years whereas they made a newer phone look the same price by quoting for a year deal so you need to watch out for that i opted for a year contract which meant paying a bit more each month but i felt it was better not to be tied in for so long i opted not to take out the insurance offered despite a rather stern warning that this could leave me liable for a replacement cost after a quick visit to a price comparison website which showed that home contents insurance which i didnt already have for my entire homes contents was half the price of the tesco insurance just for the phone delivery was quite fast i ordered on a friday and it arrived as promised on the following tuesday at the time window stated by the courier my only real gripe was that the phone box arrived in a larger box with no padding inside except for a small thin sheet of plastic i believe this may have at some point have been inflated to provide the padding but had become deflated so was not providing any protection the upshot was that the phone in its box was rattling around inside the larger box which might have caused damage in transit thankfully the actual handset was well packed inside its box so had come to no obvious harm but if tescos distributor dont want to pack the outer box properly then they may as well not waste the cardboard and plastic and just despatch the handset in its own box after delivery it was just a matter of setting up the phone i received no information about this at all the phone did the setup mostly by itself but i had a few problems and had to google for the answers,Good,4.0
6151,appreciated their patience and help,Good,4.0
6152,quite happy with overall service ive had issues with the internet which unfortunately took a while to dread ringing to sort issues as its an indian call centre they quite often dont understand what youre trying to explain and seem to follow a set script things get resolved a lot quicker easier and less frustrating when you speak to someone in this country,Good,4.0

6196,to be clear this star review is about the service i have received today and today only it has no reflection on vodafone as a company and i will never use them years of trying to sort out transfer of ownership of a vf mobile broadband and landline account to my ex husband i am relieved that this matter has finally now been resolved i posted a review a couple of weeks ago airing my frustration at how incompetent vf were at sorting out the problems i was experiencing today i have spent hour and minutes speaking to a very helpful lady called lucy in the complaints department based in newcastle after getting absolutely nowhere with previous calls made to vf and their collections i decided to try complaints and to my surprise i got connected to someone in less than took the time to listen to me and let me explain what has or has not been happening since lucy was the first and only person at vf i have spoken to in years who had all the information in front of her ie exactly when i called dates etc and gave notice on the account as well as other key information she could not understand why the services had not been disconnected three attempts made end of may but they let it roll until early november the account was then passed to a debt collection agency and i was presented with a bill for just under not to mention the possibility of my credit report being affected i finally received copies of my bills for the last months all of which had an address i lived at years ago it had never been updated to the address where the service had been provided despite me calling up and changing information on the phone on several addition the actual bill itself was incorrect with sums that were being charged for a service that should have been disconnected nearly a year lucy kindly recalculated the bill it turns out it was just over it just goes to show that when someone carries out their job properly complaints can get other departments in vf could learn a lot from lucy and her team and how they train their staff on customer service skills she was polite and courteous at all times i requested an email to confirm that this matter is now finally closed and that i do not owe any money which i received mins after my call ended i am so relieved and i dont have to worry about my credit score being tarnished luckily for me i am on good terms with my and he emailed me a copy of the debt collection demand notice otherwise i would have been none the wiser,Good,4.0

6199,this is a followup to my earlier very poor rating of tesco mobile on apr and tms reply on apr i contacted the numbers on tms reply and got through to a sales upgrades service agent very quickly she was very helpful and efficient in discussing my upgrade and processing the agreed package the whole process took about minutes much better than the minutes plus that i endured when engaged with a chat line earlier well done tm however there are two things that you must review if you are to retain your high ratings on review pages make sure all relevant phone numbers are easy to find on your website at present they are not the agent today confirmed this examine the effectiveness of chat line interactions in meeting customer needs they did not meet mine i have now upgraded my contract and am looking forward to renewed excellent service from tesco mobile,Good,4.0

6329,i must start off by saying that when the broadband is working well the speeds etc are fantastic i do have a criticism about the customer service i have generally received for a year or two my broadband would drop in and out this was frustrating for viewing streaming sites and disastrous when we started working from home as we would have to abandon meetings frequently i have had many calls with your customer service staff all of whom were very polite and helpful each time i would have to reboot everything and the problem would go away for hours you wouldnt send an engineer out when i asked because the problem was fixed however temporarily while i was on the phone i said many times that this would be temporary and the same problem would come back the following day but still there was a refusal to send out an engineer recently i received the new hub which didnt seem to help i then bought a set of tp link wifi mesh units and have set them up around the house we havent had one day of dropped wifi since and the service is brilliant its really annoying that i had to work through this problem myself and pay to get it sorted my sister recently signed up to sky her broadband speeds were so dismal i told her to cancel her contract and go with virgin she hasnt looked back since,Good,4.0

6341,honestly its been a decent time the internet itself is sometimes intermittent but i wouldnt be surprised if thats because im in the middle of nowhere i wont lie the reason its lost a star is because of sneaky promotions that they dont really advertise i wanted to upgrade my speeds around the time internet prices went up and to upgrade would cost me less than staying at what i was at my old speed costed going up to and my new one costs i also like that the aid service is quite cheap and its really worth it no real issues so far so i dont see why id review it badly,Good,4.0

6467,update happy its only fair to provide an update so the customer service team have always been polite the help can sometimes not work out but they try i was very lucky that both nathan and toby got hold of this issue and seem to have wrestled it to successful resolution the added personal touch makes a difference there were still a couple of minor issues around exact dates and times but they appear to be the liaison between physical network provider and but credit where its due all the people i have dealt with both coming to the house and external ducts and by phone have been friendly and polite and seem genuinely willing to help they might not fully grasp the issues repercussions but they genuinely care now i actually have internet a week later than expected it is an excellent service its speedy and appears highly resilient i would add the issues seem to arise more from porting phone numbers so if you dont need to i would recommend you dont bother porting if you do need to port then look at possibly porting post installation the issue is as part of the porting process have to communicate with your current provider now even though tell them to only port the telephony phone number most suppliers take this as a red notice and commence the disconnection process on the whole line which is fine if the installation runs smoothly if it doesnt however you can unfortunately like we did end up with a gap in internet service which technically isnt fault but at the same time kind of is as they ported you before checking they could physically get their service theres a phrase about assumptions we all know and it applies here as they assume it will all go to plan all in all lesson to learn is port post installation if you must if you dont need to port numbers just get a new one and cancel the old service when they new one is in and lesson to learn is have a backup contingency plan for when installation dont go accordingly to after a rocky start pleased to be connected and with a personal touch and some personal ownership theyve turned my frown up side down well done you go form star to star be warned the connection process is poorly handled and littered with risk we signed up for the expensive service gb and as per the guidelines made no contact with out current supplier to arrange disconnection without our knowledge contacted our supplier and arranged our disconnection they then failed to install our new service and we are now sat with no internet connectivity my wife and i cannot work from home as we should be and the family have no tv i have flagged this upcoming issue to them for weeks and either had delayed responses or told it will be fixed by the th all being well i have pointed out this date was days and days after my disconnection day they have failed to acknowledge this point or put in place any so we are left disconnected they triggered our disconnection and we cant reconnect or sign up to a new provider without waiting days be warned the connection is apparently very good by the migration and installation process is shambolic and you will left dealing with poorly engaging customer services who dont seem to understand the issue,Good,4.0
6468,my slight problem resolved quickly and easily but lack of information on bill caused this problem,Good,4.0
6469,as a complete novice in all things technical i found customer services very helpful when explaining what i needed when the product arrived i was able to make it work very easily so thank you the only hiccup was that the delivery arrived a day before i requested and i was on holiday resulting in a trip to the post office,Good,4.0

6475,i have been a customer for a little while now and after initial teething problems the service was fantastic i recently moved house and needed to transfer my account it was a challenging time and the transfer did not go as smoothly as it could have or should have but the customer service team technical support and installation engineer were all great people i really believe they did their utmost to mitigate difficult circumstance they did not tire of my constant pestering and provided professional and courteous support at all times there were a few days of confusion and some technical hitches but we navigated the troubled waters together and look forward to plain sailing now that everything is running as it should if it all went through on the right day and without difficulties it would have been a big stars but unfortunately the ball was dropped and that cost a point despite the hiccup i would strongly recommend,Good,4.0

7225,this review is for a bt big button old cordless phone stopped working after a power cut and as a result i decided to buy a new phone answer machine this unit is large size with big buttons as it is primarily designed for people with poorer eyesight hearing this means that i can easily read the display without my glasses but that the calling number cannot be displayed on one screen as it needs to automatically scroll across the page to be read this is a shame but if it didnt the numbers would have to be smaller and thus defeat the following the instructions to the letter i found set up easy the phone itself is wonderful at blocking scam callers but you do need to take the time to enter your family friends numbers to prevent them being was easy and the phone was promptly dispatched unfortunately it was delivered by royal mail and the box had become dented as not enough care had been given to its delivery this did not however damage the phone units as they are securely packaged inside the outer thing that may help readers to understand some of the other phone reviews is that cordless phones do not seem to require a line filter when you have broadband on the line they work fine by plugging them straight into the line socket corded phones do however require a line filter to be plugged into the line socket first as otherwise they will sound really crackly and you will think the phone is faulty hope this review is of help,Good,4.0

7480,speed is not up to expected speed when contract taken line chat has been very helpful,Good,4.0
7481,having been a customer with contracts for several years i have always found this company tries its best to help resolve issues fast i recently wished to upgrade from x htc heroes to x iphone s but my sister worked for orange the same company and could get staff discount on line rental i explained to members of staff both over the phone in the shop that i wished to stay with tmobile and could they match the deal their replies were unfortunately no so i reluctantly cancelled my contract with them and proceeded to get my pac code etc i was then contacted hrs later by the tmobile retention department to ask if i had managed to use my pac code yet i said no they then offered to match the orange deal i had quoted if i cancelled my cancellation i am very pleased with the service i have always received but why go through all that to eventually offer me a deal that could have been given from the start would have been stars otherwise,Good,4.0
7482,all in all i would recommend talktalk especially talktalk business as their prices are really fair like the unlimited landline calls for per month which for a business is a total bargain but i would warn people that they just can not seem to get new orders for lines or line moves right it will all go wrong and on occasions we have had to wait weeks for them to get themselves organised and actually get some lines in this has caused problems but once the lines are in service is smooth very affordable and the customer services are helpful and friendly just do not rely on them to get you a line installed on a deadline,Good,4.0
7483,convenience and speed of not having to re type everything is great but only offered a broadband and home line package on entertainment we dont want a landline and our current package includes sky etc so will still have to source all this,Good,4.0

7485,had to battle with the offshore customer service department who seemed hell bent on selling me more bandwidth eventually managed to make an on shore customer service team that i was experiencing technical issues with my very old tivo boxes both old boxes were replaced and all my issues went away the flexibility from the two new boxes is excellent and the streaming service are now a joy to use now the sting in the tail i have been informed of a large price hike that i cant afford so my have to terminate my subscription,Good,4.0
7486,talktalk hasnt fully disappointed yet all issues i had were down to the line itself at leat this is however a diy network you better know what you are doing as their support lacks my last call with them some tech reset my router no backup or even informed it of it my custom configuration was all lost had to reconfigure from scratch and even that they could not help with as dhcp and dns was not something they could even value for money is amazing and they are keen to help just not always able to,Good,4.0
7487,i have quite a bit of business with them and am absolutely fine with their service i did have a problem with transferring a landline number when i bought a new broadband from them and it took calls and numerous chats to resolve the problem their operators were very polite but just failed to sort the problem all now resolved but annoying at the time broadband is pretty reliable mobile service is the best for my locations and my two landlines are free so overall a very good price they focus on dealing through apps which can be frustrating and for a phone company they dont publish actual phone numbers curious but true like anything you only know how good a company is when things go wrong the shops were rubbish they knew nothing and just me off on several occasions i am a bit surprised at how bad these reviews are overall they seem ok to me,Good,4.0

7493,i was happy with the person i spoke with and she was very polite but i am very very unhappy and disappointed with talk talk three years of being tormented with unwanted phone calls although i was ex directory i had a recycled number and they wouldnt change it they blamed routers and five visits from open reach no fault found inside my home yet the wifi signal was half the amount promised by the contract for most of the time router turning off several times in a week over the three years threatening to charge me four hundred pounds if i cancelled the service failing to cancel the so called service and taking money regardless from my when my contract had ended i have lots more to add but i am waiting to get a response from the ombudsman to a larger list of complaints than i have listed here i will be back to add to this,Good,4.0
7494,i have bought from the bt shop before and when i got an email with a promotion on a wifi broadband extender that i was already considering buying it was a no brainer to go with process and easy to follow with good communication after the order was placed and good turned up exactly on schedule,Good,4.0

8497,very swift service lewis parsons called me back straight away after using the chat service online straight forward communication and not trying to bamboozle with the technical elements as some do clear presentation of costs and when they are due probably the easiest sign up to a new broadband package in my life and when in the process of moving house this is a major advantage update well apparently they are swift to sell you and product and take your money but unable to deliver the extra money paid doesnt make the service run any quicker if they are unable to provide the service on the date they state when they sign up no one gets in touch with you to let you know and refunds are not provided there is no consideration to the impact this has on your working role or the fact that children need to access live lessons during a pandemic apparently a sorry is sufficient as far as they are concerned after theyve taken your money despite the considerable impact on peoples lives in this day and age where everything is done remotely i dont think a better service and clearer communication is much to ask for im now tied into a contract that already is not delivering for me and excuses why they wont refund the extra money paid for a priority service not provided before its even started avoid at all costs,Good,5.0
